Wide o’er man my realm extends, and proud the name that I, the goddess Cypris, bear, both in heaven’s courts and ’mongst all those who dwell within the limits of the sea and the bounds of Atlas, beholding the sun-god’s light;	Πολλὴ μὲν ἐν βροτοῖσι κοὐκ ἀνώνυμος, θεὰ κέκλημαι Κύπρις, οὐρανοῦ τ’ ἔσω· ὅσοι τε Πόντου τερμόνων τ’ Ἀτλαντικῶν ναίουσιν εἴσω φῶς ὁρῶντες ἡλίου,
those that respect my power I advance to honour, but bring to ruin all who vaunt themselves at me. For even in the race of gods this feeling finds a home, even pleasure at the honour men pay them.	τοὺς μὲν σέβοντας τἀμὰ πρεσβεύω κράτη, σφάλλω δ’ ὅσοι φρονοῦσιν εἰς ἡμᾶς μέγα. ἔνεστι γὰρ δὴ κἀν θεῶν γένει τόδε· τιμώμενοι χαίρουσιν ἀνθρώπων ὕπο.
And the truth of this I soon will show;	δείξω δὲ μύθων τῶνδ’ ἀλήθειαν τάχα·
for that son of Theseus, born of the Amazon, Hippolytus, whom holy Pittheus taught, alone of all the dwellers in this land of Troezen, calls me vilest of the deities. Love he scorns, and, as for marriage, will none of it;	ὁ γάρ με Θησέως παῖς, Ἀμαζόνος τόκος, Ἱππόλυτος, ἁγνοῦ Πιτθέως παιδεύματα, μόνος πολιτῶν τῆσδε γῆς Τροζηνίας λέγει κακίστην δαιμόνων πεφυκέναι, ἀναίνεται δὲ λέκτρα κοὐ ψαύει γάμων·
but Artemis, daughter of Zeus, sister of Phoebus, he doth honour, counting her the chief of goddesses, and ever through the greenwood, attendant on his virgin goddess, he dears the earth of wild beasts with his fleet hounds, enjoying the comradeship of one too high for mortal ken.	Φοίβου δ’ ἀδελφὴν Ἄρτεμιν, Διὸς κόρην, τιμᾷ, μεγίστην δαιμόνων ἡγούμενος· χλωρὰν δ’ ἀν’ ὕλην παρθένῳ ξυνὼν ἀεὶ κυσὶν ταχείαις θῆρας ἐξαιρεῖ χθονός, μείζω βροτείας προσπεσὼν ὁμιλίας.
’Tis not this I grudge him, no! why should I? But for his sins against me, I will this very day take vengeance on Hippolytus; for long ago I cleared the ground of many obstacles, so it needs but trifling toil.	τούτοισι μέν νυν οὐ φθονῶ· τί γάρ με δεῖ; ἃ δ’ εἰς ἔμ’ ἡμάρτηκε, τιμωρήσομαι Ἱππόλυτον ἐν τῇδ’ ἡμέρᾳ· τὰ πολλὰ δὲ πάλαι προκόψασ’ — οὐ πόνου πολλοῦ με δεῖ.
For as he came one day from the home of Pittheus	ἐλθόντα γάρ νιν Πιτθέως ποτ’ ἐκ δόμων
to witness the solemn mystic rites and be initiated therein in Pandion’s land, Phaedra, his father’s noble wife, caught sight of him, and by my designs she found her heart was seized with wild desire.	σεμνῶν ἐς ὄψιν καὶ τέλη μυστηρίων Πανδίονος γῆν, πατρὸς εὐγενὴς δάμαρ ἰδοῦσα Φαίδρα καρδίαν κατέσχετο ἔρωτι δεινῷ τοῖς ἐμοῖς βουλεύμασιν.
And ere she came to this Troezenian realm,	καὶ πρὶν μὲν ἐλθεῖν τήνδε γῆν Τροζηνίαν,
a temple did she rear to  Cypris hard by the rock of Pallas where it o’erlooks this country, for love of the youth in another land; and to win his love in days to come she called after his name the temple she had founded for the goddess.	πέτραν παρ’ αὐτὴν Παλλάδος, κατόψιον γῆς τῆσδε, ναὸν Κύπριδος ἐγκαθίσατο, ἐρῶσ’ ἔρωτ’ ἔκδημον· Ἱππολύτῳ δ’ ἔπι τὸ λοιπὸν ὠνόμαζ’ ἐνιδρῦσθαι θεάν.
Now, when Theseus left the land of Cecrops,	ἐπεὶ δὲ Θησεὺς Κεκροπίαν λείπει χθόνα,
flying the pollution of the blood of Pallas’ sons, and with his wife sailed to this shore, content to suffer exile for a year, then began the wretched wife to pine away in silence, moaning ’neath love’s cruel scourge,	μίασμα φεύγων αἵματος Παλλαντιδῶν, καὶ τήνδε σὺν δάμαρτι ναυστολεῖ χθόνα, ἐνιαυσίαν ἔκδημον αἰνέσας φυγήν, ἐνταῦθα δὴ στένουσα κἀκπεπληγμένη κέντροις ἔρωτος ἡ τάλαιν’ ἀπόλλυται
and none of her servants knows what ails her. But this passion of hers must not fail thus. No, I will discover the matter to Theseus, and all shall be laid bare. Then will the father slay his child, my bitter foe, by curses,	σιγῇ· ξύνοιδε δ’ οὔτις οἰκετῶν νόσον. ἀλλ’ οὔτι ταύτῃ τόνδ’ ἔρωτα χρὴ πεσεῖν· δείξω δὲ Θησεῖ πρᾶγμα , κἀκφανήσεται. καὶ τὸν μὲν ἡμῖν πολέμιον νεανίαν κτενεῖ πατὴρ ἀραῖσιν, ἃς ὁ πόντιος
for the lord Poseidon granted this boon to Theseus; three wishes of the god to ask, nor ever ask in vain. So Phaedra is to die, an honoured death ’tis true, but still to die; for I will not let her suffering outweigh the payment of such forfeit by my foes	ἄναξ Ποσειδῶν ὤπασεν Θησεῖ γέρας, μηδὲν μάταιον ἐς τρὶς εὔξασθαι θεῷ. ἣ δ’ εὐκλεὴς μέν, ἀλλ’ ὅμως ἀπόλλυται, Φαίδρα· τὸ γὰρ τῆσδ’ οὐ προτιμήσω κακὸν τὸ μὴ οὐ παρασχεῖν τοὺς ἐμοὺς ἐχθροὺς ἐμοὶ
as shall satisfy my honour.	δίκην τοσαύτην ὥστ’ ἐμοὶ καλῶς ἔχειν.
But lo! I see the son of Theseus coming hither—Hippolytus, fresh from the labours of the chase. I will get me hence. At his back follows a long train	ἀλλ’, εἰσορῶ γὰρ τόνδε παῖδα Θησέως στείχοντα, θήρας μόχθον ἐκλελοιπότα, Ἱππόλυτον, ἔξω τῶνδε βήσομαι τόπων. πολὺς δ’ ἅμ’ αὐτῷ προσπόλων ὀπισθόπους
of retainers, in joyous cries of revelry uniting and hymns of praise to Artemis, his goddess; for little he recks that Death hath oped his gates for him, and that this is his last look upon the light.	κῶμος λέλακεν, Ἄρτεμιν τιμῶν θεὰν ὕμνοισιν· οὐ γὰρ οἶδ’ ἀνεῳγμένας πύλας Ἅιδου, φάος δὲ λοίσθιον βλέπων τόδε.
Come follow, friends, singing to Artemis, daughter of Zeus, throned in the sky,	ἕπεσθ’ ἀείδοντες ἕπεσθε τὰν Διὸς οὐρανίαν
whose votaries we are.	Ἄρτεμιν, ᾇ μελόμεσθα.
Lady goddess, awful queen, daughter of Zeus, all hail! hail! child of	πότνια πότνια σεμνοτάτα, Ζανὸς γένεθλον, χαῖρε, χαῖρέ μοι, ὦ κόρα
Latona and of Zeus, peerless mid the virgin choir, who hast thy dwelling in heaven’s wide mansions at thy noble father’s court, in the golden house of Zeus.	Λατοῦς Ἄρτεμι καὶ Διός, καλλίστα πολὺ παρθένων, ἃ μέγαν κατ’ οὐρανὸν ναίεις εὐπατέρειαν αὐ- λάν, Ζηνὸς πολύχρυσον οἶκον.
All hail! most beauteous Artemis, lovelier far than all the daughters of Olympus!	χαῖρέ μοι, ὦ καλλίστα καλ- λίστα τῶν κατ’ Ὄλυμπον.
For thee, O mistress mine, I bring this woven wreath, culled from a virgin meadow,	σοὶ τόνδε πλεκτὸν στέφανον ἐξ ἀκηράτου λειμῶνος, ὦ δέσποινα, κοσμήσας φέρω,
where nor shepherd dares to herd his flock nor ever scythe hath mown, but o’er the mead unshorn the bee doth wing its way in spring; and with the dew from rivers drawn purity that garden tends. Such as know no cunning lore, yet in whose nature	ἔνθ’ οὔτε ποιμὴν ἀξιοῖ φέρβειν βοτὰ οὔτ’ ἦλθέ πω σίδαρος, ἀλλ’ ἀκήρατον μέλισσα λειμῶν’ ἠρινὴ διέρχεται, Αἰδὼς δὲ ποταμίαισι κηπεύει δρόσοις· ὅσοις διδακτὸν μηδέν, ἀλλ’ ἐν τῇ φύσει
self-control, made perfect, hath a home, these may pluck the flowers, but not the wicked world. Accept, I pray, dear mistress, mine this chaplet from my holy hand to crown thy locks of gold; for I, and none other of mortals, have this high guerdon,	τὸ σωφρονεῖν εἴληχεν ἐς τὰ πάνθ’ ὁμῶς, τούτοις δρέπεσθαι, τοῖς κακοῖσι δ’ οὐ θέμις. ἀλλ’, ὦ φίλη δέσποινα, χρυσέας κόμης ἀνάδημα δέξαι χειρὸς εὐσεβοῦς ἄπο. μόνῳ γάρ ἐστι τοῦτ’ ἐμοὶ γέρας βροτῶν·
to be with thee, with thee converse, hearing thy voice, though not thy face beholding. So be it mine to end my life as I began.	σοὶ καὶ ξύνειμι καὶ λόγοις ἀμείβομαι, κλύων μὲν αὐδήν, ὄμμα δ’ οὐχ ὁρῶν τὸ σόν. τέλος δὲ κάμψαιμ’ ὥσπερ ἠρξάμην βίου.
My prince! we needs must call upon the gods, our lords, so wilt thou listen to a friendly word from me?	ἄναξ — θεοὺς γὰρ δεσπότας καλεῖν χρεών — ἆρ’ ἄν τί μου δέξαιο βουλεύσαντος εὖ;
Why, that will I! else were I proved a fool.	καὶ κάρτα γ’· ἦ γὰρ οὐ σοφοὶ φαινοίμεθ’ ἄν.
Dost know, then, the way of the world?	οἶσθ’ οὖν βροτοῖσιν ὃς καθέστηκεν νόμος
Not I; but wherefore such a question?	οὐκ οἶδα· τοῦ δὲ καί μ’ ἀνιστορεῖς πέρι;
It hates reserve which careth not for all men’s love.	μισεῖν τὸ σεμνὸν καὶ τὸ μὴ πᾶσιν φίλον.
And rightly too; reserve in man is ever galling.	ὀρθῶς γε· τίς δ’ οὐ σεμνὸς ἀχθεινὸς βροτῶν;
But there’s a charm in courteous affability?	ἐν δ’ εὐπροσηγόροισιν ἔστι τις χάρις;
The greatest surely; aye, and profit, too, at trifling cost.	πλείστη γε, καὶ κέρδος γε σὺν μόχθῳ βραχεῖ.
Dost think the same law holds in heaven as well?	ἦ κἀν θεοῖσι ταὐτὸν ἐλπίζεις τόδε;
I trow it doth, since all our laws we men from heaven draw.	εἴπερ γε θνητοὶ θεῶν νόμοισι χρώμεθα.
Why, then, dost thou neglect to greet an august goddess?	πῶς οὖν σὺ σεμνός, δαίμον’ οὐ προσεννέπων
Whom speak’st thou of? Keep watch upon thy tongue lest it some mischief cause.	τίν’; εὐλαβοῦ δὲ μή τί σου σφαλῇ στόμα.
Cypris I mean, whose image is stationed o’er thy gate.	τήνδ’, ἣ πύλαισι σαῖς ἐφέστηκεν Κύπρις.
I greet her from afar, preserving still my chastity.	πρόσωθεν αὐτὴν ἁγνὸς ὢν ἀσπάζομαι.
Yet is she an august goddess, far renowned on earth. 	σεμνός γε μέντοι κἀπίσημος ἐν βροτοῖς.
’Mongst gods as well as men we have our several preferences.	ἄλλοισιν ἄλλος θεῶν τε κἀνθρώπων μέλει.
I wish thee luck, and wisdom too, so far as thou dost need it.	εὐδαιμονοίης νοῦν ἔχων ὅσον σε δεῖ.
No god, whose worship craves the night, hath charms for me.	οὐδείς μ’ ἀρέσκει νυκτὶ θαυμαστὸς θεῶν.
My son, we should avail us of the gifts that gods confer.	τιμαῖσιν, ὦ παῖ, δαιμόνων χρῆσθαι χρεών.
Go in, my faithful followers, and make ready food within the house; a well-filled board hath charms after the chase is o’er.	χωρεῖτ’, ὀπαδοί, καὶ παρελθόντες δόμους σίτων μέλεσθε· τερπνὸν ἐκ κυναγίας
Rub down my steeds ye must, that when I have had my all I may yoke them to the chariot and give them proper exercise.	τράπεζα πλήρης· καὶ καταψήχειν χρεὼν ἵππους, ὅπως ἂν ἅρμασιν ζεύξας ὕπο βορᾶς κορεσθεὶς γυμνάσω τὰ πρόσφορα.
As for thy Queen of Love, a long farewell to her.	τὴν σὴν δὲ Κύπριν πόλλ’ ἐγὼ χαίρειν λέγω.
Meantime I with sober mind, for I must not copy my young master,	ἡμεῖς δέ — τοὺς νέους γὰρ οὐ μιμητέον,
do offer up my prayer to thy image, lady Cypris, in such words as it becomes a slave to use. But thou should’st pardon all, who, in youth’s impetuous heat, speak idle words of thee; make as though thou hearest not,	φρονοῦντας οὕτως — ὡς πρέπει δούλοις λέγειν, προσευξόμεσθα τοῖσι σοῖς ἀγάλμασιν, δέσποινα Κύπρι. χρὴ δὲ συγγνώμην ἔχειν, εἴ τίς σ’ ὑφ’ ἥβης σπλάγχνον ἔντονον φέρων μάταια βάζει· μὴ δόκει τούτων κλύειν·
for gods must needs be wiser than the sons of men.	σοφωτέρους γὰρ χρὴ βροτῶν εἶναι θεούς.
A rock there is, where, as they say, the ocean dew distils, and from its beetling brow it pours a copious stream for pitchers to be dipped therein;	Ὠκεανοῦ τις ὕδωρ στάζουσα πέτρα λέγεται, βαπτὰν κάλπισι ῥυτὰν πα- γὰν προιεῖσα κρημνῶν·
’twas here I had a friend washing robes of purple in the trickling stream, and she was spreading them out on the face of a warm sunny rock; from her	ὅθι μοί τις ἦν φίλα πορφύρεα φάρεα ποταμίᾳ δρόσῳ τέγγουσα, θερ- μᾶς δ’ ἐπὶ νῶτα πέτρας εὐ- αλίου κατέβαλλ’· ὅθεν
I had the tidings, first of all, that my mistress	μοι πρώτα φάτις ἦλθε δεσποίνας·
she was wasting on the bed of sickness, pent within her house, a thin veil o’ershadowing her head of golden hair.	τειρομέναν νοσερᾷ κοίτᾳ δέμας ἐντὸς ἔχειν οἴκων, λεπτὰ δὲ φάρη ξάν- θαν κεφαλὰν σκιάζειν·
And this is the third day I hear that she hath closed her lovely lips and denied her chaste body all sustenance, eager to hide her suffering	τριτάταν δέ νιν κλύω τάνδ’ ἀβρωσίᾳ στόματος ἁμέραν Δάματρος ἀ- κτᾶς δέμας ἁγνὸν ἴσχειν, κρυ- πτῷ πένθει θανάτου θέλου-
and reach death’s cheerless bourn.	σαν κέλσαι ποτὶ τέρμα δύστανον.
Maiden, thou must be possessed, by Pan made frantic or by Hecate, or by the Corybantes dread, and Cybele the mountain mother.	— ἦ σὺ γ’ ἔνθεος, ὦ κούρα, εἴτ’ ἐκ Πανὸς εἴθ’ Ἑκάτας ἢ σεμνῶν Κορυβάντων φοι- τᾷς ἢ ματρὸς ὀρείας;
Or maybe thou hast sinned against Dictynna, huntress-queen, and art wasting for thy guilt in sacrifice unoffered. For she doth range o’er lakes’ expanse and past the bounds of earth	— σὺ δ’ ἀμφὶ τὰν πολύθηρον Δί- κτυνναν ἀμπλακίαις ἀνίε- ρος ἀθύτων πελάνων τρύχῃ; φοιτᾷ γὰρ καὶ διὰ λίμνας χέρσον θ’ ὑπὲρ πελάγους
upon the ocean’s tossing billows.	δίναις ἐν νοτίαις ἅλμας.
Or doth some rival in thy house beguile thy lord, the captain of Erechtheus’ sons, that hero nobly bom, to secret amours hid from thee?	— ἢ πόσιν, τὸν Ἐρεχθειδᾶν ἀρχαγόν, τὸν εὐπατρίδαν, ποιμαίνει τις ἐν οἴκοις κρυ- πτὰ κοίτα λεχέων σῶν;
Or hath some mariner sailing hither from Crete reached this port that sailors love, with evil tidings for our queen, and she with sorrow for her grievous fate	— ἢ ναυβάτας τις ἔπλευσεν Κρή- τας ἔξορμος ἀνὴρ λιμένα τὸν εὐξεινότατον ναύταις, φήμαν πέμπων βασιλείᾳ, λύπᾳ δ’ ὑπὲρ παθέων
is to her bed confined?	εὐναία δέδεται ψυχά;
Yea, and oft o’er woman’s wayward nature settles a feeling of miserable perplexity, arising from labour-pains or passionate desire.	— φιλεῖ δὲ τᾷ δυστρόπῳ γυναικῶν ἁρμονίᾳ κακὰ δύστανος ἀμηχανία συνοικεῖν, ὠδινῶν τε καὶ ἀφροσύνας.
I, too, have felt at times this sharp thrill shoot through me, but I would cry to Artemis, queen of archery, who comes from heaven to aid us in our travail, and thanks to heaven’s grace she ever comes at my call with welcome help.	δι’ ἐμᾶς ᾖξέν ποτε νηδύος ἅδ’ αὔρα. τὰν δ’ εὔλοχον οὐρανίαν τόξων μεδέουσαν ἀύτευν Ἄρτεμιν, καί μοι πολυζήλωτος αἰεὶ σὺν θεοῖσι φοιτᾷ.
Look! where the aged nurse is bringing her forth from the house before the door, while on her brow the cloud of gloom is deepening. My soul longs to learn what is her grief, the canker that is	— ἀλλ’ ἥδε τροφὸς γεραιὰ πρὸ θυρῶν τήνδε κομίζουσ’ ἔξω μελάθρων· τί ποτ’ ἔστι μαθεῖν ἔραται ψυχή, τί δεδήληται
wasting our queen’s fading charms.	δέμας ἀλλόχροον βασιλείας.
O, the ills of mortal men! the cruel diseases they endure! What can I do for thee? from what refrain? Here is the bright sun-light, here the azure sky; lo! we have brought thee on thy bed of sickness	ὦ κακὰ θνητῶν στυγεραί τε νόσοι. τί σ’ ἐγὼ δράσω; τί δὲ μὴ δράσω; τόδε σοι φέγγος λαμπρόν, ὅδ’ αἰθήρ· ἔξω δὲ δόμων ἤδη νοσερᾶς
without the palace; for all thy talk was of coming hither, but soon back to thy chamber wilt thou hurry. Disappointment follows fast with thee, thou hast no joy in aught for long; the present has no power to please; on something absent	δέμνια κοίτης. δεῦρο γὰρ ἐλθεῖν πᾶν ἔπος ἦν σοι· τάχα δ’ ἐς θαλάμους σπεύσεις τὸ πάλιν. ταχὺ γὰρ σφάλλῃ κοὐδενὶ χαίρεις, οὐδέ σ’ ἀρέσκει τὸ παρόν, τὸ δ’ ἀπὸν
next thy heart is set. Better be sick than tend the sick; the first is but a single ill, the last unites mental grief with manual toil. Man’s whole life is full of anguish;	φίλτερον ἡγῇ. κρεῖσσον δὲ νοσεῖν ἢ θεραπεύειν· τὸ μέν ἐστιν ἁπλοῦν, τῷ δὲ συνάπτει λύπη τε φρενῶν χερσίν τε πόνος. πᾶς δ’ ὀδυνηρὸς βίος ἀνθρώπων,
no respite from his woes he finds; but if there is aught to love beyond this life, night’s dark pall doth wrap it round. And so we show our mad love of this life because its light is shed on earth,	κοὐκ ἔστι πόνων ἀνάπαυσις. ἀλλ’ ὅ τι τοῦ ζῆν φίλτερον ἄλλο σκότος ἀμπίσχων κρύπτει νεφέλαις. τοῦ δ’ ὅ τι τοῦτο στίλβει κατὰ γῆν δυσέρωτες δὴ φαινόμεθ’ ὄντες,
and because we know no other, and have naught revealed to us of all our earth may hide; and trusting to fables we drift at random. 	δι’ ἀπειροσύνην ἄλλου βιότου κοὐκ ἀπόδειξιν τῶν ὑπὸ γαίας· μύθοις δ’ ἄλλως φερόμεσθα.
Lift my body, raise my head! My limbs are all unstrung, kind friends.	ἄρατέ μου δέμας, ὀρθοῦτε κάρα· λέλυμαι μελέων σύνδεσμα φίλων.
O handmaids, lift my arms, my shapely arms. The tire on my head is too heavy for me to wear; away with it, and let my tresses o’er my shoulders fall.	λάβετ’ εὐπήχεις χεῖρας, πρόπολοι. βαρύ μοι κεφαλᾶς ἐπίκρανον ἔχειν· ἄφελ’, ἀμπέτασον βόστρυχον ὤμοις.
Be of good heart, dear child; toss not so wildly to and fro.	θάρσει, τέκνον, καὶ μὴ χαλεπῶς μετάβαλλε δέμας.
Lie still, be brave, so wilt thou find thy sickness easier to bear; suffering for mortals is nature’s iron law.	ῥᾷον δὲ νόσον μετά θ’ ἡσυχίας καὶ γενναίου λήματος οἴσεις· μοχθεῖν δὲ βροτοῖσιν ἀνάγκη.
Ah! would I could draw a draught of water pure from some dew-fed spring, and lay me down to rest in the grassy meadow ’neath the poplar’s shade!	αἰαῖ· πῶς ἂν δροσερᾶς ἀπὸ κρηνῖδος καθαρῶν ὑδάτων πῶμ’ ἀρυσαίμαν, ὑπό τ’ αἰγείροις ἔν τε κομήτῃ λειμῶνι κλιθεῖσ’ ἀναπαυσαίμαν;
My child, what wild speech is this? O say not such things in public, wild whirling words of frenzy bred!	ὦ παῖ, τί θροεῖς; οὐ μὴ παρ’ ὄχλῳ τάδε γηρύσῃ μανίας ἔποχον ῥίπτουσα λόγον;
Away to the mountain take me! to the wood, to the pine-trees I will go, where hounds pursue the prey, hard on the scent of dappled fawns. Ye gods! what joy to hark them on,	πέμπετέ μ’ εἰς ὄρος· εἶμι πρὸς ὕλαν καὶ παρὰ πεύκας, ἵνα θηροφόνοι στείβουσι κύνες βαλιαῖς ἐλάφοις ἐγχριμπτόμεναι· πρὸς θεῶν, ἔραμαι κυσὶ θωΰξαι
to grasp the barbed dart, to poise Thessalian hunting-spears close to my golden hair, then let them fly.	καὶ παρὰ χαίταν ξανθὰν ῥῖψαι Θεσσαλὸν ὅρπακ’, ἐπίλογχον ἔχουσ’ ἐν χειρὶ βέλος.
Why, why, my child, these anxious cares? What hast thou to do with the chase?	τί ποτ’, ὦ τέκνον, τάδε κηραίνεις; τί κυνηγεσίων καὶ σοὶ μελέτη;
Why so eager for the flowing spring, when hard by these towers stands a hill well watered, whence thou may’st freely draw?	τί δὲ κρηναίων νασμῶν ἔρασαι; πάρα γὰρ δροσερὰ πύργοις συνεχὴς κλιτύς, ὅθεν σοι πῶμα γένοιτ’ ἄν.
O Artemis, who watchest o’er sea-beat Limna and the race-course thundering to the horse’s hoofs,	δέσποιν’ ἁλίας Ἄρτεμι Λίμνας καὶ γυμνασίων τῶν ἱπποκρότων,
would I were upon thy plains curbing Venetian steeds!	εἴθε γενοίμαν ἐν σοῖς δαπέδοις, πώλους Ἐνέτας δαμαλιζομένα.
Why betray thy frenzy in these wild whirling words? Now thou wert for hasting hence to the hills away to hunt wild beasts, and now	τί τόδ’ αὖ παράφρων ἔρριψας ἔπος; νῦν δὴ μὲν ὄρος βᾶσ’ ἐπὶ θήρας πόθον ἐστέλλου, νῦν δ’ αὖ ψαμάθοις
thy yearning is to drive the steed over the waveless sands. This needs a cunning seer to say what god it is that reins thee from the course, distracting thy senses, child.	ἐπ’ ἀκυμάντοις πώλων ἔρασαι. τάδε μαντείας ἄξια πολλῆς, ὅστις σε θεῶν ἀνασειράζει καὶ παρακόπτει φρένας, ὦ παῖ.
Ah me! alas! what have I done?	δύστηνος ἐγώ, τί ποτ’ εἰργασάμην;
Whither have I strayed, my senses leaving? Mad, mad! stricken by some demon’s curse! Woe is me! Cover my head again, nurse. Shame fills me for the words I have spoken.	ποῖ παρεπλάγχθην γνώμης ἀγαθῆς; ἐμάνην, ἔπεσον δαίμονος ἄτῃ. φεῦ φεῦ, τλήμων. μαῖα, πάλιν μου κρύψον κεφαλήν, αἰδούμεθα γὰρ τὰ λελεγμένα μοι.
Hide me then; from my eyes the tear-drops stream, and for very shame I turn them away. Tis painful coming to one’s senses again, and madness, evil though it be, has this advantage, that one has no knowledge of reason’s overthrow.	κρύπτε· κατ’ ὄσσων δάκρυ μοι βαίνει, καὶ ἐπ’ αἰσχύνην ὄμμα τέτραπται. τὸ γὰρ ὀρθοῦσθαι γνώμην ὀδυνᾷ· τὸ δὲ μαινόμενον κακόν· ἀλλὰ κρατεῖ μὴ γιγνώσκοντ’ ἀπολέσθαι.
There then I cover thee; but when will death hide my body in the grave? Many a lesson length of days is teaching me. Yea, mortal men should pledge themselves	κρύπτω· τὸ δ’ ἐμὸν πότε δὴ θάνατος σῶμα καλύψει; πολλὰ διδάσκει μ’ ὁ πολὺς βίοτος. χρῆν γὰρ μετρίας εἰς ἀλλήλους φιλίας θνητοὺς ἀνακίρνασθαι
to moderate friendships only, not to such as reach the very heart’s core; affection’s ties should be light upon them to let them slip or draw them tight. For one poor heart to grieve for twain, as I do	καὶ μὴ πρὸς ἄκρον μυελὸν ψυχῆς, εὔλυτα δ’ εἶναι στέργηθρα φρενῶν ἀπό τ’ ὤσασθαι καὶ ξυντεῖναι. τὸ δ’ ὑπὲρ δισσῶν μίαν ὠδίνειν ψυχὴν χαλεπὸν βάρος, ὡς κἀγὼ
for my mistress, is a burden sore to bear. Men say that too engrossing pursuits in life more oft cause disappointment than pleasure,	τῆσδ’ ὑπεραλγῶ. βιότου δ’ ἀτρεκεῖς ἐπιτηδεύσεις φασὶ σφάλλειν πλέον ἢ τέρπειν τῇ θ’ ὑγιείᾳ μᾶλλον πολεμεῖν. οὕτω τὸ λίαν ἧσσον ἐπαινῶ
and too oft are foes to health. Wherefore I do not praise excess so much as moderation, and with me wise men will agree.	τοῦ μηδὲν ἄγαν· καὶ ξυμφήσουσι σοφοί μοι.
O aged dame, faithful nurse of Phaedra, our queen, we see her sorry plight; but what it is that ails her we cannot discern,	γύναι γεραιά, βασιλίδος πιστὴ τροφὲ Φαίδρας, ὁρῶμεν τάσδε δυστήνους τύχας, ἄσημα δ’ ἡμῖν ἥτις ἐστὶν ἡ νόσος·
so fain would learn of thee and hear thy opinion.	σοῦ δ’ ἂν πυθέσθαι καὶ κλύειν βουλοίμεθ’ ἄν.
I question her, but am no wiser, for she will not answer.	οὐκ οἶδ’ ἐλέγχους· οὐ γὰρ ἐννέπειν θέλει.
Nor tell what source these sorrows have?	οὐδ’ ἥτις ἀρχὴ τῶνδε πημάτων ἔφυ;
The same answer thou must take, for she is dumb on every point.	ἐς ταὐτὸν ἥκεις· πάντα γὰρ σιγᾷ τάδε.
How weak and wasted is her body!	ὡς ἀσθενεῖ τε καὶ κατέξανται δέμας.
What marvel? ’tis three days now since she has tasted food.	πῶς δ’ οὔ, τριταίαν γ’ οὖσ’ ἄσιτος ἡμέραν;
Is this infatuation, or an attempt to die?	πότερον ὑπ’ ἄτης ἢ θανεῖν πειρωμένη;
’Tis death she courts; such fasting aims at ending life.	θανεῖν; ἀσιτεῖ γ’ εἰς ἀπόστασιν βίου.
A strange story! is her husband satisfied?	θαυμαστὸν εἶπας, εἰ τάδ’ ἐξαρκεῖ πόσει.
She hides from him her sorrow, and vows she is not ill. 	κρύπτει γὰρ ἥδε πῆμα κοὔ φησιν νοσεῖν.
Can he not guess it from her face?	ὃ δ’ ἐς πρόσωπον οὐ τεκμαίρεται βλέπων;
He is not now in his own country.	ἔκδημος ὢν γὰρ τῆσδε τυγχάνει χθονός.
But dost not thou insist in thy endeavour to find out her complaint, her crazy mind?	σὺ δ’ οὐκ ἀνάγκην προσφέρεις, πειρωμένη νόσον πυθέσθαι τῆσδε καὶ πλάνον φρενῶν;
I have tried every plan, and all in vain;	ἐς πάντ’ ἀφῖγμαι κοὐδὲν εἴργασμαι πλέον·
yet not even now will I relax my zeal, that thou too, if thou stayest, mayst witness my devotion to my unhappy mistress.	οὐ μὴν ἀνήσω γ’ οὐδὲ νῦν προθυμίας, ὡς ἂν παροῦσα καὶ σύ μοι ξυμμαρτυρῇς οἵα πέφυκα δυστυχοῦσι δεσπόταις.
Come, come, my darling child, let us forget, the twain of us, our former words; be thou more mild,	ἄγ’, ὦ φίλη παῖ, τῶν πάροιθε μὲν λόγων λαθώμεθ’ ἄμφω, καὶ σύ θ’ ἡδίων γενοῦ
smoothing that sullen brow and changing the current of thy thought, and I, if in aught before I failed in humouring thee, will let that be and find some better course. If thou art sick with ills thou canst not name, there be women here to help to set thee right;	στυγνὴν ὀφρὺν λύσασα καὶ γνώμης ὁδόν, ἐγώ θ’ ὅπῃ σοι μὴ καλῶς τόθ’ εἱπόμην μεθεῖσ’ ἐπ’ ἄλλον εἶμι βελτίω λόγον. κεἰ μὲν νοσεῖς τι τῶν ἀπορρήτων κακῶν, γυναῖκες αἵδε συγκαθιστάναι νόσον·
but if thy trouble can to men’s ears be divulged, speak, that physicians may pronounce on it.	εἰ δ’ ἔκφορός σοι συμφορὰ πρὸς ἄρσενας, λέγ’, ὡς ἰατροῖς πρᾶγμα μηνυθῇ τόδε.
Come, then, why so dumb? Thou shouldst not so remain, my child, but scold me if I speak amiss, or, if I give good counsel, yield assent.	εἶἑν· τί σιγᾷς; οὐκ ἐχρῆν σιγᾶν, τέκνον, ἀλλ’ ἤ μ’ ἐλέγχειν, εἴ τι μὴ καλῶς λέγω, ἢ τοῖσιν εὖ λεχθεῖσι συγχωρεῖν λόγοις.
One word, one look this way! Ah me! Friends, we waste our toil to no purpose; we are as far away as ever; she would not relent to my arguments then, nor is she yielding now.	φθέγξαι τι, δεῦρ’ ἄθρησον. — ὦ τάλαιν’ ἐγώ, γυναῖκες, ἄλλως τούσδε μοχθοῦμεν πόνους, ἴσον δ’ ἄπεσμεν τῷ πρίν· οὔτε γὰρ τότε λόγοις ἐτέγγεθ’ ἥδε νῦν τ’ οὐ πείθεται. —
Well, grow more stubborn than the sea, yet be assured of this,	ἀλλ’ ἴσθι μέντοι — πρὸς τάδ’ αὐθαδεστέρα
that if thou diest thou art a traitress to thy children, for they will ne’er inherit their father’s halls, nay, by that knightly queen the Amazon who bore a son to lord it over thine, a bastard born but not a bastard bred, whom well thou knowest,	γίγνου θαλάσσης — εἰ θανῇ, προδοῦσα σοὺς παῖδας πατρῴων μὴ μεθέξοντας δόμων, μὰ τὴν ἄνασσαν ἱππίαν Ἀμαζόνα, ἣ σοῖς τέκνοισι δεσπότην ἐγείνατο νόθον φρονοῦντα γνήσι’, οἶσθά νιν καλῶς,
e’en Hippolytus.	Ἱππόλυτον
Oh! oh!	οἴμοι.
Ha! doth that touch the quick?	θιγγάνει σέθεν τόδε;
Thou hast undone me, nurse; I do adjure by the gods, mention that man no more.	ἀπώλεσάς με, μαῖα, καί σε πρὸς θεῶν τοῦδ’ ἀνδρὸς αὖθις λίσσομαι σιγᾶν πέρι.
There now! thou art thyself again, but e’en yet refusest to aid thy children and preserve thy life.	ὁρᾷς; φρονεῖς μὲν εὖ, φρονοῦσα δ’ οὐ θέλεις παῖδάς τ’ ὀνῆσαι καὶ σὸν ἐκσῶσαι βίον.
My babes I love, but there is another storm that buffets me.	φιλῶ τέκν’· ἄλλῃ δ’ ἐν τύχῃ χειμάζομαι.
Daughter, are thy hands from bloodshed pure?	ἁγνὰς μέν, ὦ παῖ, χεῖρας αἵματος φορεῖς;
My hands are pure, but on my soul there rests a stain.	χεῖρες μὲν ἁγναί, φρὴν δ’ ἔχει μίασμά τι.
The issue of some enemy’s secret witchery?	μῶν ἐξ ἐπακτοῦ πημονῆς ἐχθρῶν τινος;
A friend is my destroyer, one unwilling as myself.	φίλος μ’ ἀπόλλυσ’ οὐχ ἑκοῦσαν οὐχ ἑκών.
Hath Theseus wronged thee in any wise?	Θησεύς τιν’ ἡμάρτηκεν ἐς σ’ ἁμαρτίαν;
Never may I prove untrue to him	μὴ δρῶσ’ ἔγωγ’ ἐκεῖνον ὀφθείην κακῶς.
Then what strange mystery is there that drives thee on to die?	τί γὰρ τὸ δεινὸν τοῦθ’ ὅ σ’ ἐξαίρει θανεῖν;
O, let my sin and me alone! ’tis not ’gainst thee I sin.	ἔα μ’ ἁμαρτεῖν· οὐ γὰρ ἐς σὲ ἁμαρτάνω.
Never willingly! and, if I fail, ’twill rest at thy door.	οὐ δῆθ’ ἑκοῦσά γ’, ἐν δὲ σοὶ λελείψομαι.
How now? thou usest force in clinging to my hand.	τί δρᾷς; βιάζῃ χειρὸς ἐξαρτωμένη;
Yea, and I will never loose my hold upon thy knees.	καὶ σῶν γε γονάτων, κοὐ μεθήσομαί ποτε.
Alas for thee! my sorrows, shouldst thou learn them, would recoil on thee.	κάκ’, ὦ τάλαινα, σοὶ τάδ’, εἰ πεύσῃ, κακά.
What keener grief for me than failing to win thee?	μεῖζον γὰρ ἢ σοῦ μὴ τυχεῖν τί μοι κακόν;
’Twill be death to thee; though to me that brings renown.	ὀλεῖς· τὸ μέντοι πρᾶγμ’ ἐμοὶ τιμὴν φέρει.
And dost thou then conceal this boon despite my prayers?	κἄπειτα κρύπτεις χρήσθ’ ἱκνουμένης ἐμοῦ;
I do, for ’tis out of shame I am planning an honourable escape.	ἐκ τῶν γὰρ αἰσχρῶν ἐσθλὰ μηχανώμεθα.
Tell it, and thine honour shall the brighter shine.	οὐκοῦν λέγουσα τιμιωτέρα φανῇ.
Away, I do conjure thee; loose my hand.	ἄπελθε πρὸς θεῶν δεξιᾶς τ’ ἐμῆς μέθες.
I will not, for the boon thou shouldst have granted me is denied. 	οὐ δῆτ’, ἐπεί μοι δῶρον οὐ δίδως ὃ χρῆν.
I will grant it out of reverence for thy holy sup- pliant touch.	δώσω· σέβας γὰρ χειρὸς αἰδοῦμαι τὸ σόν.
Henceforth I hold my peace; ’tis thine to speak from now.	σιγῷμ’ ἂν ἤδη· σὸς γὰρ οὑντεῦθεν λόγος.
Ah! hapless mother, what a love was thine!	ὦ τλῆμον, οἷον, μῆτερ, ἠράσθης ἔρον,
Her love for the bull? daughter, or what meanest thou?	ὃν ἔσχε Ταύρου, τέκνον, ἢ τί φῂς τόδε;
And woe to thee! my sister, bride of Dionysus.	σύ τ’, ὦ τάλαιν’ ὅμαιμε, Διονύσου δάμαρ,
What ails thee, child? speaking ill of kith and kin.	τέκνον, τί πάσχεις; συγγόνους κακορροθεῖς;
Myself the third to suffer! how am I undone!	τρίτη δ’ ἐγὼ δύστηνος ὡς ἀπόλλυμαι.
Thou strik’st me dumb! Where will this history end?	ἔκ τοι πέπληγμαι· ποῖ προβήσεται λόγος;
That love has been our curse from time long past.	ἐκεῖθεν ἡμεῖς, οὐ νεωστί, δυστυχεῖς.
I know no more of what I fain would learn.	οὐδέν τι μᾶλλον οἶδ’ ἃ βούλομαι κλύειν.
Ah! would thou couldst say for me what I have to tell.	φεῦ· πῶς ἂν σύ μοι λέξειας ἁμὲ χρὴ λέγειν;
I am no prophetess to unriddle secrets.	οὐ μάντις εἰμὶ τἀφανῆ γνῶναι σαφῶς.
What is it they mean when they talk of people being in love?	τί τοῦθ’, ὃ δὴ λέγουσιν ἀνθρώπους, ἐρᾶν;
At once the sweetest and the bitterest thing, my child.	ἥδιστον, ὦ παῖ, ταὐτὸν ἀλγεινόν θ’ ἅμα.
I shall only find the latter half.	ἡμεῖς ἂν εἶμεν θατέρῳ κεχρημένοι.
Ha! my child, art thou in love?	τί φῄς; ἐρᾷς, ὦ τέκνον; ἀνθρώπων τίνος;
The Amazon’s son, whoever he may be,—	ὅστις ποθ’ οὗτός ἐσθ’, ὁ τῆς Ἀμαζόνος
Mean’st thou Hippolytus?	Ἱππόλυτον αὐδᾷς;
’Twas thou, not I, that spoke his name.	σοῦ τάδ’, οὐκ ἐμοῦ κλύεις.
O heavens! what is this, my child? Thou hast ruined me. Outrageous! friends; I will not live and bear it;	οἴμοι, τί λέξεις, τέκνον; ὥς μ’ ἀπώλεσας. γυναῖκες, οὐκ ἀνασχέτ’· οὐκ ἀνέξομαι
hateful is life, hateful to mine eyes the light. This body I resign, will cast it off, and rid me of existence by my death. Farewell, my life is o’er. Yea, for the chaste have wicked passions, ’gainst their will maybe, but still they have. Cypris, it seems, is not a goddess after all,	ζῶσ’· ἐχθρὸν ἦμαρ, ἐχθρὸν εἰσορῶ φάος. ῥίψω μεθήσω σῶμ’, ἀπαλλαχθήσομαι βίου θανοῦσα· χαίρετ’· οὐκέτ’ εἴμ’ ἐγώ. οἱ σώφρονες γὰρ οὐχ ἑκόντες, ἀλλ’ ὅμως κακῶν ἐρῶσι. Κύπρις οὐκ ἄρ’ ἦν θεός,
but something greater far, for she hath been the ruin of my lady and of me and our whole family.	ἀλλ’ εἴ τι μεῖζον ἄλλο γίγνεται θεοῦ, ἣ τήνδε κἀμὲ καὶ δόμους ἀπώλεσεν.
O, too clearly didst thou hear our queen uplift her voice to tell her startling tale of piteous suffering. Come death ere I reach thy state of feeling, loved mistress.	ἄιες ὤ, ἔκλυες ὤ, ἀνήκουστα τᾶς τυράννου πάθεα μέλεα θρεομένας; — ὀλοίμαν ἔγωγε, πρὶν σὰν φιλίαν
O horrible! woe, for these miseries! woe, for the sorrows on which mortals feed! Thou art undone! thou hast disclosed thy sin to heaven’s light. What hath each passing day and every hour in store for thee?	κατανύσαι φρενῶν. ἰώ μοι, φεῦ φεῦ. — ὦ τάλαινα τῶνδ’ ἀλγέων· — ὦ πόνοι τρέφοντες βροτούς. — ὄλωλας, ἐξέφηνας ἐς φάος κακά. — τίς σε παναμέριος ὅδε χρόνος μένει;
Some strange event will come to pass in this house. For it is no longer uncertain where the star of thy love is setting, thou hapless daughter of Crete.	— τελευτάσεταί τι καινὸν δόμοις. — ἄσημα δ’ οὐκέτ’ ἐστὶν οἷ φθίνει τύχα Κύπριδος, ὦ τάλαινα παῖ Κρησία.
Ladies of Troezen, who dwell here upon the frontier edge of Pelops’ land,	Τροζήνιαι γυναῖκες, αἳ τόδ’ ἔσχατον οἰκεῖτε χώρας Πελοπίας προνώπιον,
oft ere now in heedless mood through the long hours of night have I wondered why man’s life is spoiled; and it seems to me their evil case is not due to any natural fault of judgment, for there be many dowered with sense, but we must view the matter in this light;	ἤδη ποτ’ ἄλλως νυκτὸς ἐν μακρῷ χρόνῳ θνητῶν ἐφρόντισ’ ᾗ διέφθαρται βίος. καί μοι δοκοῦσιν οὐ κατὰ γνώμης φύσιν πράσσειν κάκιον· ἔστι γὰρ τό γ’ εὖ φρονεῖν πολλοῖσιν· ἀλλὰ τῇδ’ ἀθρητέον τόδε·
by teaching and experience we learn the right but neglect it in practice, some from sloth, others from preferring pleasure of some kind or other to duty. Now life has many pleasures, protracted talk, and leisure, that seductive evil;	τὰ χρήστ’ ἐπιστάμεσθα καὶ γιγνώσκομεν, οὐκ ἐκπονοῦμεν δ’, οἳ μὲν ἀργίας ὕπο, οἳ δ’ ἡδονὴν προθέντες ἀντὶ τοῦ καλοῦ ἄλλην τιν’. εἰσὶ δ’ ἡδοναὶ πολλαὶ βίου, μακραί τε λέσχαι καὶ σχολή, τερπνὸν κακόν,
likewise there is shame which is of two kinds, one a noble quality, the other a curse to families; but if for each its proper time were clearly known, these twain could not have had the selfsame letters to denote them.	αἰδώς τε. δισσαὶ δ’ εἰσίν, ἣ μὲν οὐ κακή, ἣ δ’ ἄχθος οἴκων. εἰ δ’ ὁ καιρὸς ἦν σαφής, οὐκ ἂν δύ’ ἤστην ταὔτ’ ἔχοντε γράμματα.
So then since I had made up my mind on these points, ’twas not likely any drug would alter it	ταῦτ’ οὖν ἐπειδὴ τυγχάνω φρονοῦσ’ ἐγώ, οὐκ ἔσθ’ ὁποίῳ φαρμάκῳ διαφθερεῖν
and make me think the contrary. And I will tell thee too the way my judgment went. When love wounded me, I bethought me how I best might bear the smart. So from  that day forth I began to hide in silence what I suffered.	ἔμελλον, ὥστε τοὔμπαλιν πεσεῖν φρενῶν. λέξω δὲ καὶ σοὶ τῆς ἐμῆς γνώμης ὁδόν· ἐπεί μ’ ἔρως ἔτρωσεν, ἐσκόπουν ὅπως κάλλιστ’ ἐνέγκαιμ’ αὐτόν. ἠρξάμην μὲν οὖν ἐκ τοῦδε, σιγᾶν τήνδε καὶ κρύπτειν νόσον.
For I put no faith in counsellors, who know well to lecture others for presumption, yet themselves have countless troubles of their own. Next I did devise noble endurance of these wanton thoughts, striving by continence for victory.	γλώσσῃ γὰρ οὐδὲν πιστόν, ἣ θυραῖα μὲν φρονήματ’ ἀνδρῶν νουθετεῖν ἐπίσταται, αὐτὴ δ’ ὑφ’ αὑτῆς πλεῖστα κέκτηται κακά. τὸ δεύτερον δὲ τὴν ἄνοιαν εὖ φέρειν τῷ σωφρονεῖν νικῶσα προυνοησάμην.
And last when I could not succeed in mastering love hereby, methought it best to die; and none can gainsay my purpose. For fain I would my virtue should to all appear, my shame have few to witness it.	τρίτον δ’, ἐπειδὴ τοισίδ’ οὐκ ἐξήνυτον Κύπριν κρατῆσαι, κατθανεῖν ἔδοξέ μοι, κράτιστον — οὐδεὶς ἀντερεῖ — βουλευμάτων. ἐμοὶ γὰρ εἴη μήτε λανθάνειν καλὰ μήτ’ αἰσχρὰ δρώσῃ μάρτυρας πολλοὺς ἔχειν.
I knew my sickly passion now; to yield to it I saw how infamous; and more, I learnt to know so well that I was but a woman, a thing the world detests. Curses, hideous curses on that wife, who first did shame her marriage-vow for lovers other than her lord! ’Twas from noble families	τὸ δ’ ἔργον ᾔδη τὴν νόσον τε δυσκλεᾶ, γυνή τε πρὸς τοῖσδ’ οὖσ’ ἐγίγνωσκον καλῶς, μίσημα πᾶσιν. ὡς ὄλοιτο παγκάκως ἥτις πρὸς ἄνδρας ἤρξατ’ αἰσχύνειν λέχη πρώτη θυραίους. ἐκ δὲ γενναίων δόμων
this curse began to spread among our sex. For when the noble countenance disgrace, poor folk of course will think that it is right. Those too I hate who make profession of purity, though in secret reckless sinners.	τόδ’ ἦρξε θηλείαισι γίγνεσθαι κακόν. ὅταν γὰρ αἰσχρὰ τοῖσιν ἐσθλοῖσιν δοκῇ, ἦ κάρτα δόξει τοῖς κακοῖς γ’ εἶναι καλά. μισῶ δὲ καὶ τὰς σώφρονας μὲν ἐν λόγοις, λάθρᾳ δὲ τόλμας οὐ καλὰς κεκτημένας.
How can these, queen Cypris, ocean’s child, e’er look their husbands in the face? do they never feel one guilty thrill that their accomplice, night, or the chambers of their house will find a voice and speak?	αἳ πῶς ποτ’, ὦ δέσποινα ποντία Κύπρι, βλέπουσιν ἐς πρόσωπα τῶν ξυνευνετῶν οὐδὲ σκότον φρίσσουσι τὸν ξυνεργάτην τέραμνά τ’ οἴκων μή ποτε φθογγὴν ἀφῇ;
This it is that calls on me to die, kind friends,	ἡμᾶς γὰρ αὐτὸ τοῦτ’ ἀποκτείνει, φίλαι,
that so I may ne’er be found to have disgraced my lord, or the children I have born; no! may they grow up and dwell in glorious Athens, free to speak and act, heirs to such fair fame as a mother can bequeath. For to know that father or mother have sinned doth turn	ὡς μήποτ’ ἄνδρα τὸν ἐμὸν αἰσχύνασ’ ἁλῶ, μὴ παῖδας οὓς ἔτικτον· ἀλλ’ ἐλεύθεροι παρρησίᾳ θάλλοντες οἰκοῖεν πόλιν κλεινῶν Ἀθηνῶν, μητρὸς οὕνεκ’ εὐκλεεῖς. δουλοῖ γὰρ ἄνδρα, κἂν θρασύσπλαγχνός τις ᾖ,
the stoutest heart to slavishness. This alone, men say, can stand the buffets of life’s battle, a just and virtuous soul in whomsoever found. For time unmasks the villain sooner or later, holding up to them a mirror as to some blooming maid.	ὅταν ξυνειδῇ μητρὸς ἢ πατρὸς κακά. μόνον δὲ τοῦτό φασ’ ἁμιλλᾶσθαι βίῳ, γνώμην δικαίαν κἀγαθήν, ὅτῳ παρῇ. κακοὺς δὲ θνητῶν ἐξέφην’, ὅταν τύχῃ, προθεὶς κάτοπτρον ὥστε παρθένῳ νέᾳ
’Mongst such may I be never seen!	χρόνος· παρ’ οἷσι μήποτ’ ὀφθείην ἐγώ.
Now look! how fair is chastity however viewed, whose fruit is good repute amongst men.	φεῦ φεῦ· τὸ σῶφρον ὡς ἁπανταχοῦ καλὸν καὶ δόξαν ἐσθλὴν ἐν βροτοῖς καρπίζεται.
My queen, ’tis true thy tale of woe, but lately told, did for the moment strike me with wild alarm,	δέσποιν’, ἐμοί τοι συμφορὰ μὲν ἀρτίως ἡ σὴ παρέσχε δεινὸν ἐξαίφνης φόβον·
but now I do reflect upon my foolishness; second thoughts are often best even with men. Thy fate is no uncommon one nor past one’s calculations; thou art stricken by the passion Cypris sends. Thou art in love; what wonder? so are many more.	νῦν δ’ ἐννοοῦμαι φαῦλος οὖσα· κἀν βροτοῖς αἱ δεύτεραί πως φροντίδες σοφώτεραι. οὐ γὰρ περισσὸν οὐδὲν οὐδ’ ἔξω λόγου πέπονθας· ὀργαὶ δ’ ἐς σ’ ἀπέσκηψαν θεᾶς. ἐρᾷς· τί τοῦτο θαῦμα; σὺν πολλοῖς βροτῶν.
Wilt thou, because thou lov’st, destroy thyself? ’Tis little gain, I trow, for those who love or yet may love their fellows, if death must be their end; for though the Love-Queen’s onset in her might is more than man can bear, yet doth she gently visit yielding hearts,	κἄπειτ’ ἔρωτος οὕνεκα ψυχὴν ὀλεῖς; οὔ τἄρα λύει τοῖς ἐρῶσι τῶν πέλας, ὅσοι τε μέλλουσ’, εἰ θανεῖν αὐτοὺς χρεών· Κύπρις γὰρ οὐ φορητός, ἢν πολλὴ ῥυῇ· ἣ τὸν μὲν εἴκονθ’ ἡσυχῇ μετέρχεται,
and only when she finds a proud unnatural spirit, doth she take and mock it past belief. Her path is in the sky, and mid the ocean’s surge she rides; from her all nature springs; she sows the seeds of love, inspires the warm desire	ὃν δ’ ἂν περισσὸν καὶ φρονοῦνθ’ εὕρῃ μέγα, τοῦτον λαβοῦσα — πῶς δοκεῖς; — καθύβρισεν. φοιτᾷ δ’ ἀν’ αἰθέρ’, ἔστι δ’ ἐν θαλασσίῳ κλύδωνι Κύπρις, πάντα δ’ ἐκ ταύτης ἔφυ· ἥδ’ ἐστὶν ἡ σπείρουσα καὶ διδοῦσ’ ἔρον
to which we sons of earth all owe our being. They who have aught to do with books of ancient scribes, or themselves engage in studious pursuits, know how Zeus of Semele was enamoured,	οὗ πάντες ἐσμὲν οἱ κατὰ χθόν’ ἔγγονοι. ὅσοι μὲν οὖν γραφάς τε τῶν παλαιτέρων ἔχουσιν αὐτοί τ’ εἰσὶν ἐν μούσαις ἀεί, ἴσασι μὲν Ζεὺς ὥς ποτ’ ἠράσθη γάμων Σεμέλης, ἴσασι δ’ ὡς ἀνήρπασέν ποτε
how the bright-eyed goddess of the Dawn once stole Cephalus to dwell in heaven for the love she bore him; yet these in heaven abide nor shun the gods’ approach, content, I trow, to yield to their misfortune.	ἡ καλλιφεγγὴς Κέφαλον ἐς θεοὺς Ἕως ἔρωτος εἵνεκ’· ἀλλ’ ὅμως ἐν οὐρανῷ ναίουσι κοὐ φεύγουσιν ἐκποδὼν θεούς, στέργουσι δ’, οἶμαι, ξυμφορᾷ νικώμενοι.
Wilt thou refuse to yield? thy sire, it seems, should have begotten thee on special terms	σὺ δ’ οὐκ ἀνέξῃ; χρῆν σ’ ἐπὶ ῥητοῖς ἄρα
or with different gods for masters, if in these laws thou wilt not acquiesce. How many, prithee, men of sterling sense, when they see their wives unfaithful, make as though they saw it not? How many fathers, when their sons have gone astray,	πατέρα φυτεύειν, ἢ ’πὶ δεσπόταις θεοῖς ἄλλοισιν, εἰ μὴ τούσδε γε στέρξεις νόμους. πόσους δοκεῖς δὴ κάρτ’ ἔχοντας εὖ φρενῶν νοσοῦνθ’ ὁρῶντας λέκτρα μὴ δοκεῖν ὁρᾶν; πόσους δὲ παισὶ πατέρας ἡμαρτηκόσι
assist them in their amours? ’tis part of human wisdom to conceal the deed of shame. Nor should man aim at excessive refinement in his life; for they cannot with exactness finish	συνεκκομίζειν Κύπριν; ἐν σοφοῖσι γὰρ τάδ’ ἐστὶ θνητῶν, λανθάνειν τὰ μὴ καλά. οὐδ’ ἐκπονεῖν τοι χρὴ βίον λίαν βροτούς· οὐδὲ στέγην γὰρ ἧς κατηρεφεῖς δόμοι καλῶς ἀκριβώσειαν· ἐς δὲ τὴν τύχην
e’en the roof that covers in a house; and how dost thou, after falling into so deep a pit, think to escape? Nay, if thou hast more of good than bad, thou wilt fare exceeding  well, thy human nature considered.	πεσοῦσ’ ὅσην σὺ πῶς ἂν ἐκνεῦσαι δοκεῖς; ἀλλ’, εἰ τὰ πλείω χρηστὰ τῶν κακῶν ἔχεις, ἄνθρωπος οὖσα, κάρτα γ’ εὖ πράξειας ἄν.
O cease, my darling child, from evil thoughts, let wanton pride be gone, for this is naught else,	ἀλλ’, ὦ φίλη παῖ, λῆγε μὲν κακῶν φρενῶν, λῆξον δ’ ὑβρίζουσ’· οὐ γὰρ ἄλλο πλὴν ὕβρις
this wish to rival gods in perfectness. Face thy love; ’tis heaven’s will thou shouldst. Sick thou art, yet turn thy sickness to some happy issue. For there are charms and spells to soothe the soul; surely some cure for thy disease will be found.	τάδ’ ἐστί, κρείσσω δαιμόνων εἶναι θέλειν· τόλμα δ’ ἐρῶσα· θεὸς ἐβουλήθη τάδε. νοσοῦσα δ’ εὖ πως τὴν νόσον καταστρέφου. εἰσὶν δ’ ἐπῳδαὶ καὶ λόγοι θελκτήριοι· φανήσεταί τι τῆσδε φάρμακον νόσου.
Men, no doubt, might seek it long and late if our women’s minds no scheme devise.	ἦ τἄρ’ ἂν ὀψέ γ’ ἄνδρες ἐξεύροιεν ἄν, εἰ μὴ γυναῖκες μηχανὰς εὑρήσομεν.
Although she gives thee at thy present need the wiser counsel, Phaedra, yet do I praise thee. Still my praise may sound more harsh	Φαίδρα, λέγει μὲν ἥδε χρησιμώτερα πρὸς τὴν παροῦσαν ξυμφοράν, αἰνῶ δὲ σέ. ὁ δ’ αἶνος οὗτος δυσχερέστερος λόγων
and jar more cruelly on thy ear than her advice.	τῶν τῆσδε καὶ σοὶ μᾶλλον ἀλγίων κλύειν.
’Tis even this, too plausible a tongue, that overthrows good governments and homes of men. We should not speak to please the ear but point the path that leads to noble fame.	τοῦτ’ ἔσθ’ ὃ θνητῶν εὖ πόλεις οἰκουμένας δόμους τ’ ἀπόλλυσ’, οἱ καλοὶ λίαν λόγοι. οὐ γὰρ τὰ τοῖσιν ὠσὶ τερπνὰ χρὴ λέγειν, ἀλλ’ ἐξ ὅτου τις εὐκλεὴς γενήσεται.
What means this solemn speech? No need of rounded phrases; but at once must we sound the prince, telling him frankly how it is with thee. Had not thy life to such a crisis come, or wert thou with self-control endowed,	τί σεμνομυθεῖς; οὐ λόγων εὐσχημόνων δεῖ σ’, ἀλλὰ τἀνδρός. — ὡς τάχος διοιστέον, τὸν εὐθὺν ἐξειπόντας ἀμφὶ σοῦ λόγον. εἰ μὲν γὰρ ἦν σοι μὴ ’πὶ συμφοραῖς βίος τοιαῖσδε, σώφρων δ’ οὖσ’ ἐτύγχανες γυνή,
ne’er would I to gratify thy passions have urged thee to this course; but now ’tis a struggle fierce to save thy life, and therefore less to blame.	οὐκ ἄν ποτ’ εὐνῆς οὕνεχ’ ἡδονῆς τε σῆς προσῆγον ἄν σε δεῦρο· νῦν δ’ ἀγὼν μέγας σῶσαι βίον σόν, κοὐκ ἐπίφθονον τόδε.
Accursed proposal! peace, woman! never utter those shameful words again!	ὦ δεινὰ λέξασ’, οὐχὶ συγκλῄσεις στόμα καὶ μὴ μεθήσεις αὖθις αἰσχίστους λόγους;
Shameful, maybe, yet for thee better than honour’s code. Better this deed, if it shall save thy life, than that name thy pride will kill thee to retain.	αἴσχρ’, ἀλλ’ ἀμείνω τῶν καλῶν τάδ’ ἐστί σοι. κρεῖσσον δὲ τοὔργον, εἴπερ ἐκσώσει γέ σε, ἢ τοὔνομ’, ᾧ σὺ κατθανῇ γαυρουμένη.
I conjure thee, go no further! for thy words are plausible but infamous; for though as yet	καὶ μή σε πρὸς θεῶν — εὖ λέγεις γάρ, αἰσχρὰ δέ — πέρα προβῇς τῶνδ’· ὡς ὑπείργασμαι μὲν εὖ
love has not undermined my soul, yet, if in specious words thou dress thy foul suggestion, I shall be beguiled into the snare from which I am now escaping.	ψυχὴν ἔρωτι, τᾀσχρὰ δ’ ἢν λέγῃς καλῶς, ἐς τοῦθ’ ὃ φεύγω νῦν ἀναλωθήσομαι.
If thou art of this mind, ’twere well thou ne’er hadst sinned; but as it is, hear me; for that is the next best course; I in my house have charms	εἴ τοι δοκεῖ σοι, χρῆν μὲν οὔ σ’ ἁμαρτάνειν· εἰ δ’ οὖν, πιθοῦ μοι· δευτέρα γὰρ ἡ χάρις. ἔστιν κατ’ οἴκους φίλτρα μοι θελκτήρια
to soothe thy love,—’twas but now I thought of them;—these shall cure thee of thy sickness on no disgraceful terms, thy mind unhurt, if thou wilt be but brave.	ἔρωτος, ἦλθε δ’ ἄρτι μοι γνώμης ἔσω, ἅ σ’ οὔτ’ ἐπ’ αἰσχροῖς οὔτ’ ἐπὶ βλάβῃ φρενῶν παύσει νόσου τῆσδ’, ἢν σὺ μὴ γένῃ κακή.
Is thy drug a salve or potion?	πότερα δὲ χριστὸν ἢ ποτὸν τὸ φάρμακον;
I cannot tell; be content, my child, to profit by it and ask no questions.	οὐκ οἶδ’· ὀνάσθαι, μὴ μαθεῖν βούλου, τέκνον.
I fear me thou wilt prove too wise for me.	δέδοιχ’ ὅπως μοι μὴ λίαν φανῇς σοφή.
If thou fear this, confess thyself afraid of all; but why thy terror?	πάντ’ ἂν φοβηθεῖσ’ ἴσθι· δειμαίνεις δὲ τί;
Lest thou shouldst breathe a word of this to Theseus’ son.	μή μοί τι Θησέως τῶνδε μηνύσῃς τόκῳ.
Peace, my child! I will do all things well; only be thou, queen Cypris, ocean’s child, my partner in the work! And for the rest of my purpose, it will be enough for me to tell it to Our friends within the house.	ἔασον, ὦ παῖ· ταῦτ’ ἐγὼ θήσω καλῶς. μόνον σύ μοι, δέσποινα ποντία Κύπρι, συνεργὸς εἴης. τἄλλα δ’ οἷ’ ἐγὼ φρονῶ τοῖς ἔνδον ἡμῖν ἀρκέσει λέξαι φίλοις.
O Love, Love, that from the eyes diffusest soft desire, bringing on the souls of those, whom thou dost camp against, sweet grace, O never in evil mood appear to me, nor out of time and tune approach!	Ἔρως Ἔρως, ὃ κατ’ ὀμμάτων στάζεις πόθον, εἰσάγων γλυκεῖαν ψυχᾷ χάριν οὓς ἐπιστρατεύσῃ, μή μοί ποτε σὺν κακῷ φανείης μηδ’ ἄρρυθμος ἔλθοις.
Nor fire nor meteor hurls a mightier bolt than Aphrodite’s shaft shot by the hands of Love, the child of Zeus.	οὔτε γὰρ πυρὸς οὔτ’ ἄστρων ὑπέρτερον βέλος, οἷον τὸ τᾶς Ἀφροδίτας ἵησιν ἐκ χερῶν Ἔρως, ὁ Διὸς παῖς.
Idly, idly by the streams of Alpheus and in the Pythian shrines of Phoebus, Hellas  heaps the slaughtered steers; while Love we worship not, Love, the king of men, who holds the key to Aphrodite’s	ἄλλως ἄλλως παρά τ’ Ἀλφεῷ Φοίβου τ’ ἐπὶ Πυθίοις τεράμνοις βούταν φόνον Ἑλλὰς αἶ’ ἀέξει· Ἔρωτα δέ, τὸν τύραννον ἀνδρῶν, τὸν τᾶς Ἀφροδίτας
sweetest bower,—worship not him who, when he comes, lays waste and marks his path to mortal hearts by wide-spread woe.	φιλτάτων θαλάμων κλῃδοῦχον, οὐ σεβίζομεν, πέρθοντα καὶ διὰ πάσας ἰόντα συμφορᾶς θνατοῖς, ὅταν ἔλθῃ.
There was that maiden in Oechalia, a girl unwed, that knew no wooer yet nor married joys; her did the queen of Love snatch from her home across the sea	τὰν μὲν Οἰχαλίᾳ πῶλον ἄζυγα λέκτρων, ἄναν- δρον τὸ πρὶν καὶ ἄνυμφον, οἴ- κων ζεύξασ’ ἀπ’ Εὐρυτίων δρομάδα Ναΐδ’ ὅπως τε Βάκ-
and gave unto Alcmena’s son, mid blood and smoke and murderous marriage-hymns, to be to him a frantic fiend of hell; woe! woe for his wooing!	χαν σὺν αἵματι, σὺν καπνῷ φονίοις θ’ ὑμεναίοις Ἀλκμήνας τόκῳ Κύπρις ἐξέδωκεν· ὦ τλάμων ὑμεναίων.
Ah! holy walls of Thebes, ah! fount of Dirce, ye could testify what course the love-queen follows. For with the blazing levin-bolt	ὦ Θήβας ἱερὸν τεῖχος, ὦ στόμα Δίρκας, συνεί- ποιτ’ ἂν ἁ Κύπρις οἷον ἕρ- πει. βροντᾷ γὰρ ἀμφιπύρῳ τοκάδα τὰν διγόνοιο Βάκ-
did she cut short the fatal marriage of Semele, mother of Zeus-bom Bacchus. All things she doth inspire, dread goddess, winging her flight hither and thither like a bee.	χου νυμφευσαμένα πότμῳ φονίῳ κατηύνασεν. δεινὰ γὰρ παντᾷ ποτιπνεῖ, μέλισσα δ’ οἵα τις πεπόταται.
Peace, ladies, peace! I am undone.	σιγήσατ’, ὦ γυναῖκες· ἐξειργάσμεθα.
What, Phaedra, is this dread event within thy house?	τί δ’ ἔστι, Φαίδρα, δεινὸν ἐν δόμοισί σοι;
Hush! let me hear what those within are saying.	ἐπίσχετ’, αὐδὴν τῶν ἔσωθεν ἐκμάθω.
I am silent; this is surely the prelude to mischief.	σιγῶ· τὸ μέντοι φροίμιον κακὸν τόδε.
Great gods!	ἰώ μοι, αἰαῖ·
how awful are my sufferings!	ὦ δυστάλαινα τῶν ἐμῶν παθημάτων.
What a cry was there! what loud alarm! say what sudden terror, lady, doth thy soul dismay.	τίνα θροεῖς αὐδάν; τίνα βοᾷς λόγον; ἔνεπε, τίς φοβεῖ σε φήμα, γύναι, φρένας ἐπίσσυτος;
I am undone. Stand here at the door and hear the noise arising in the house.	ἀπωλόμεσθα. ταῖσδ’ ἐπιστᾶσαι πύλαις ἀκούσαθ’ οἷος κέλαδος ἐν δόμοις πίτνει.
Thou art already by the bolted door; ’tis for thee to note the sounds that issue from within. And tell me, O tell me what mischief can be on foot.	σὺ παρὰ κλῇθρα, σοὶ μέλει πομπίμα φάτις δωμάτων. ἔνεπε δ’ ἔνεπέ μοι, τί ποτ’ ἔβα κακόν;
’Tis the son of the horse-loving Amazon who calls, Hippolytus, uttering foul curses on my servant.	ὁ τῆς φιλίππου παῖς Ἀμαζόνος βοᾷ Ἱππόλυτος, αὐδῶν δεινὰ πρόσπολον κακά.
I hear a noise, but cannot clearly tell which way it comes. Ah! ’tis through the door the sound reached thee.	ἀχὰν μὲν κλύω, σαφὲς δ’ οὐκ ἔχω· γεγωνεῖ δ’ ὅπᾳ διὰ πύλας ἔμολεν ἔμολε σοὶ βοά.
Yes, yes, he is calling her plainly enough a go-between in vice,	καὶ μὴν σαφῶς γε τὴν κακῶν προμνήστριαν,
traitress to her master’s honour.	τὴν δεσπότου προδοῦσαν ἐξαυδᾷ λέχος.
Woe, woe is me! thou art betrayed, dear mistress! What counsel shall I give thee? thy secret is out; thou art utterly undone.	ὤμοι ἐγὼ κακῶν· προδέδοσαι, φίλα. τί σοι μήσομαι; τὰ κρυπτὰ γὰρ πέφηνε, διὰ δ’ ὄλλυσαι —
Ah me! ah me!	αἰαῖ, ἒ ἔ.
Betrayed by friends!	πρόδοτος ἐκ φίλων.
She hath ruined me by speaking of my misfortune; ’twas kindly meant, but an ill way to cure my malady.	ἀπώλεσέν μ’ εἰποῦσα συμφορὰς ἐμάς, φίλως, καλῶς δ’ οὐ τήνδ’ ἰωμένη νόσον.
O what wilt thou do now in thy cruel dilemma?	πῶς οὖν; τί δράσεις, ὦ παθοῦσ’ ἀμήχανα;
I only know one way,	οὐκ οἶδα πλὴν ἕν· κατθανεῖν ὅσον τάχος,
one cure for these my woes and that is instant death.	τῶν νῦν παρόντων πημάτων ἄκος μόνον.
O mother earth! O sun’s unclouded orb! What words, unfit for any lips, have reached my ears!	ὦ γαῖα μῆτερ ἡλίου τ’ ἀναπτυχαί, οἵων λόγων ἄρρητον εἰσήκουσ’ ὄπα.
Peace, my son, lest some one hear thy outcry.	σίγησον, ὦ παῖ, πρίν τιν’ αἰσθέσθαι βοῆς.
I cannot hear such awful words and hold my peace.	οὐκ ἔστ’ ἀκούσας δείν’ ὅπως σιγήσομαι.
I do implore thee by thy fair right hand.	ναὶ πρός σε τῆς σῆς δεξιᾶς εὐωλένου.
Let go my hand, touch not my robe.	οὐ μὴ προσοίσεις χεῖρα μηδ’ ἅψῃ πέπλων.
O by thy knees I pray, destroy me not utterly.	ὦ πρός σε γονάτων, μηδαμῶς μ’ ἐξεργάσῃ.
Why say this, if, as thou pretendest, thy lips are free from blame?	τί δ’, εἴπερ, ὡς φῄς, μηδὲν εἴρηκας κακόν;
My son, this is no story to be noised abroad.	ὁ μῦθος, ὦ παῖ, κοινὸς οὐδαμῶς ὅδε.
A virtuous tale grows fairer told to many.	τά τοι κάλ’ ἐν πολλοῖσι κάλλιον λέγειν.
Never dishonour thy oath, thy son.	ὦ τέκνον, ὅρκους μηδαμῶς ἀτιμάσῃς.
My tongue an oath did take, but not my heart.	ἡ γλῶσσ’ ὀμώμοχ’, ἡ δὲ φρὴν ἀνώμοτος.
My son, what wilt thou do? destroy thy friends?	ὦ παῖ, τί δράσεις; σοὺς φίλους διεργάσῃ;
Friends indeed! the wicked are no friends of mine.	ἀπέπτυσ’· οὐδεὶς ἄδικός ἐστί μοι φίλος.
O pardon me; to err is only human, child.	σύγγνωθ’· ἁμαρτεῖν εἰκὸς ἀνθρώπους, τέκνον.
Great Zeus, why didst thou, to man’s sorrow, put woman, evil counterfeit, to dwell where shines the sun? If  thou wert minded that the human race should multiply, it was not from women they should have drawn their stock,	ὦ Ζεῦ, τί δὴ κίβδηλον ἀνθρώποις κακὸν γυναῖκας ἐς φῶς ἡλίου κατῴκισας; εἰ γὰρ βρότειον ἤθελες σπεῖραι γένος, οὐκ ἐκ γυναικῶν χρῆν παρασχέσθαι τόδε,
but in thy temples they should have paid gold or iron or ponderous bronze and bought a family, each man proportioned to his offering, and so in independence dwelt, from women free.	ἀλλ’ ἀντιθέντας σοῖσιν ἐν ναοῖς βροτοὺς ἢ χρυσὸν ἢ σίδηρον ἢ χαλκοῦ βάρος παίδων πρίασθαι σπέρμα, τοῦ τιμήματος τῆς ἀξίας ἕκαστον, ἐν δὲ δώμασιν ναίειν ἐλευθέροισι θηλειῶν ἄτερ.
1 ’Tis clear from this how great a curse a woman is; the very father, that begot and nurtured her, to rid him of the mischief gives her a dower and packs her off;	τούτῳ δὲ δῆλον ὡς γυνὴ κακὸν μέγα· προσθεὶς γὰρ ὁ σπείρας τε καὶ θρέψας πατὴρ φερνὰς ἀπῴκισ’, ὡς ἀπαλλαχθῇ κακοῦ.
while the husband, who takes the noxious weed into his home, fondly decks his sorry idol in fine raiment and tricks her out in robes, squandering by degrees, unhappy wight! his house’s wealth. For he is in this dilemma;	ὁ δ’ αὖ λαβὼν ἀτηρὸν ἐς δόμους φυτὸν γέγηθε κόσμον προστιθεὶς ἀγάλματι καλὸν κακίστῳ καὶ πέπλοισιν ἐκπονεῖ δύστηνος, ὄλβον δωμάτων ὑπεξελών.
say his marriage has brought him good connections, he is glad then to keep the wife he loathes; or, if he gets a good wife but useless relations, he tries to stifle the bad luck with the good. But it is easiest for him who has settled in his house as wife a mere nobody, incapable from simplicity.	ῥᾷστον δ’ ὅτῳ τὸ μηδέν, ἀλλ’ ἀνωφελὴς εὐηθίᾳ κατ’ οἶκον ἵδρυται γυνή.
I hate a clever woman; never may she set foot in my house who aims at knowing more than women need; for in these clever women Cypris implants a larger store of villainy, while the artless woman is by her shallow wit from levity debarred.	σοφὴν δὲ μισῶ· μὴ γὰρ ἔν γ’ ἐμοῖς δόμοις εἴη φρονοῦσα πλείον’ ἢ γυναῖκα χρή. τὸ γὰρ κακοῦργον μᾶλλον ἐντίκτει Κύπρις ἐν ταῖς σοφαῖσιν· ἡ δ’ ἀμήχανος γυνὴ γνώμῃ βραχείᾳ μωρίαν ἀφῃρέθη.
No servant should ever have had access to a wife, but men should put to live with them beasts, which bite, not talk, in which case they could not speak to any one nor be answered back by them. But, as it is, the wicked in their chambers plot wickedness,	χρῆν δ’ ἐς γυναῖκα πρόσπολον μὲν οὐ περᾶν, ἄφθογγα δ’ αὐταῖς συγκατοικίζειν δάκη θηρῶν, ἵν’ εἶχον μήτε προσφωνεῖν τινα μήτ’ ἐξ ἐκείνων φθέγμα δέξασθαι πάλιν. νῦν δ’ αἳ μὲν ἔνδον δρῶσιν αἱ κακαὶ κακὰ
and their servants carry it abroad.	βουλεύματ’, ἔξω δ’ ἐκφέρουσι πρόσπολοι.
Even thus, vile wretch, thou cam’st to make me partner in an outrage on my father’s honour; wherefore I must wash that stain away in running streams, dashing the water into my ears. How could I commit so foul a crime	ὡς καὶ σύ γ’ ἡμῖν πατρός, ὦ κακὸν κάρα, λέκτρων ἀθίκτων ἦλθες ἐς συναλλαγάς· ἁγὼ ῥυτοῖς νασμοῖσιν ἐξομόρξομαι, ἐς ὦτα κλύζων. πῶς ἂν οὖν εἴην κακός,
when by the very mention of it I feel myself polluted? Be well assured, woman, ’tis only my religious scruple saves thee. For had not I unawares been caught by an oath, ’fore heaven! I would not have refrained from telling all unto my father. But now I will from the house away, so long as	ὃς οὐδ’ ἀκούσας τοιάδ’ ἁγνεύειν δοκῶ; εὖ δ’ ἴσθι, τοὐμόν σ’ εὐσεβὲς σῴζει, γύναι· εἰ μὴ γὰρ ὅρκοις θεῶν ἄφαρκτος ᾑρέθην, οὐκ ἄν ποτ’ ἔσχον μὴ οὐ τάδ’ ἐξειπεῖν πατρί. νῦν δ’ ἐκ δόμων μέν, ἔστ’ ἂν ἔκδημος χθονὸς
Theseus is abroad, and will maintain strict silence. But, when my father comes, I will return and see how thou and thy mistress face him, and so shall I learn by experience the extent of thy audacity.	Θησεύς, ἄπειμι· σῖγα δ’ ἕξομεν στόμα. θεάσομαι δὲ σὺν πατρὸς μολὼν ποδὶ πῶς νιν προσόψῃ καὶ σὺ καὶ δέσποινα σή· τῆς σῆς δὲ τόλμης εἴσομαι γεγευμένος.
Perdition seize you both! I can never satisfy my hate for	ὄλοισθε. μισῶν δ’ οὔποτ’ ἐμπλησθήσομαι
women, no! not even though some say this is ever my theme, for of a truth they always are evil. So either let some one prove them chaste, or let me still trample on them for ever.	γυναῖκας, οὐδ’ εἴ φησί τίς μ’ ἀεὶ λέγειν· ἀεὶ γὰρ οὖν πώς εἰσι κἀκεῖναι κακαί. ἤ νύν τις αὐτὰς σωφρονεῖν διδαξάτω, ἢ κἄμ’ ἐάτω ταῖσδ’ ἐπεμβαίνειν ἀεί.
O the cruel, unhappy fate of women!	τάλανες ὦ κακοτυχεῖς γυναικῶν πότμοι.
What arts, what arguments have we, once we have made a slip, to loose by craft the tight-drawn knot? I have met my deserts. O earth, O light of day! How can I escape the stroke of fate? How my pangs conceal, kind friends?	τίνα νῦν ἢ τέχναν ἔχομεν ἢ τίνας σφαλεῖσαι κάθαμμα λύειν λόγους; ἐτύχομεν δίκας· ἰὼ γᾶ καὶ φῶς. πᾷ ποτ’ ἐξαλύξω τύχας; πῶς δὲ πῆμα κρύψω, φίλαι;
What god will appear to help me, what mortal to take my part or help me in unrighteousness? The present calamity of my life admits of no escape. Most hapless I of all my sex!	τίς ἂν θεῶν ἀρωγὸς ἢ τίς ἂν βροτῶν πάρεδρος ἢ ξυνεργὸς ἀδίκων ἔργων φανείη; τὸ γὰρ παρ’ ἡμῖν πάθος πέραν δυσεκπέρατον ἔρχεται βίου. κακοτυχεστάτα γυναικῶν ἐγώ.
Alas, alas! the deed is done, thy servant’s schemes have gone awry, my queen, and all is lost.	φεῦ φεῦ· πέπρακται, κοὐ κατώρθωνται τέχναι, δέσποινα, τῆς σῆς προσπόλου, κακῶς δ’ ἔχει.
Accursed woman! traitress to thy friends! How hast thou ruined me! May Zeus, my ancestor, smite thee with his fiery bolt and uproot thee from thy place.	ὦ παγκακίστη καὶ φίλων διαφθορεῦ, οἷ’ εἰργάσω με. Ζεύς σε γεννήτωρ ἐμὸς πρόρριζον ἐκτρίψειεν οὐτάσας πυρί.
Did I not foresee thy purpose, did I not bid thee keep silence on the very matter which is now my shame? But thou wouldst not be still; wherefore my fair name will not go with me to the tomb. But now I must another scheme devise. Yon youth, in the keenness of his fury,	οὐκ εἶπον — οὐ σῆς προυνοησάμην φρενός; — σιγᾶν ἐφ’ οἷσι νῦν ἐγὼ κακύνομαι; σὺ δ’ οὐκ ἀνέσχου· τοιγὰρ οὐκέτ’ εὐκλεεῖς θανούμεθ’. ἀλλὰ δεῖ με δὴ καινῶν λόγων. οὗτος γὰρ ὀργῇ συντεθηγμένος φρένας
will tell his father of my sin, and the aged Pittheus of my state, and fill the world  with stories to my shame. Perdition seize thee and every meddling fool who by dishonest means would serve unwilling friends!	ἐρεῖ καθ’ ἡμῶν πατρὶ σὰς ἁμαρτίας, ἐρεῖ δὲ Πιτθεῖ τῷ γέροντι συμφοράς, πλήσει τε πᾶσαν γαῖαν αἰσχίστων λόγων. ὄλοιο καὶ σὺ χὥστις ἄκοντας φίλους πρόθυμός ἐστι μὴ καλῶς εὐεργετεῖν.
Mistress, thou may’st condemn the mischief I have done, for sorrow’s sting o’ermasters thy judgment; yet can I answer thee in face of this, if thou wilt hear. ’Twas I who nurtured thee; I love thee still; but in my search for medicine to cure thy sickness I found what least I sought.	δέσποιν’, ἔχεις μὲν τἀμὰ μέμψασθαι κακά· τὸ γὰρ δάκνον σου τὴν διάγνωσιν κρατεῖ· ἔχω δὲ κἀγὼ πρὸς τάδ’, εἰ δέξῃ, λέγειν. ἔθρεψά σ’ εὔνους τ’ εἰμί· τῆς νόσου δέ σοι ζητοῦσα φάρμαχ’ ηὗρον οὐχ ἁβουλόμην.
Had I but succeeded, I had been counted wise, for the credit we get for wisdom is measured by our success.	εἰ δ’ εὖ γ’ ἔπραξα, κάρτ’ ἂν ἐν σοφοῖσιν ἦ· πρὸς τὰς τύχας γὰρ τὰς φρένας κεκτήμεθα.
Is it just, is it any satisfaction to me, that thou shouldst wound me first, then bandy words with me?	ἦ γὰρ δίκαια ταῦτα κἀξαρκοῦντά μοι, τρώσασαν ἡμᾶς εἶτα συγχωρεῖν λόγοις;
We dwell on this too long; I was not wise, I own;	μακρηγοροῦμεν· οὐκ ἐσωφρόνουν ἐγώ.
but there are yet ways of escape from the trouble, my child.	ἀλλ’ ἔστι κἀκ τῶνδ’ ὥστε σωθῆναι, τέκνον.
Be dumb henceforth; evil was thy first advice to me, evil too thy attempted scheme. Begone and leave me, look to thyself; I will my own fortunes for the best arrange.	παῦσαι λέγουσα· καὶ τὰ πρὶν γὰρ οὐ καλῶς παρῄνεσάς μοι κἀπεχείρησας κακά. ἀλλ’ ἐκποδὼν ἄπελθε καὶ σαυτῆς πέρι φρόντιζ’· ἐγὼ γὰρ τἀμὰ θήσομαι καλῶς.
Ye noble daughters of Troezen, grant me the only boon I crave; in silence bury what ye here have heard.	ὑμεῖς δέ, παῖδες εὐγενεῖς Τροζήνιαι, τοσόνδε μοι παράσχετ’ ἐξαιτουμένῃ, σιγῇ καλύπτειν ἁνθάδ’ εἰσηκούσατε.
By majestic Artemis, child of Zeus, I swear I will never divulge aught of thy sorrows.	ὄμνυμι σεμνὴν Ἄρτεμιν, Διὸς κόρην, μηδὲν κακῶν σῶν ἐς φάος δείξειν ποτέ.
’Tis well. But I, with all my thought, can but one way discover out of this calamity, that so I may secure my children’s honour, and find myself some help as matters stand. For never, never will I bring shame upon my Cretan home,	καλῶς ἔλεξας· ἓν δὲ προτρέπουσ’ ἐγὼ εὕρημα δῆτα τῆσδε συμφορᾶς ἔχω, ὥστ’ εὐκλεᾶ μὲν παισὶ προσθεῖναι βίον, αὐτή τ’ ὀνάσθαι πρὸς τὰ νῦν πεπτωκότα. οὐ γάρ ποτ’ αἰσχυνῶ γε Κρησίους δόμους,
nor will I, to save one poor life, face Theseus after my disgrace.	οὐδ’ ἐς πρόσωπον Θησέως ἀφίξομαι αἰσχροῖς ἐπ’ ἔργοις οὕνεκα ψυχῆς μιᾶς.
Art thou bent then on some cureless woe?	μέλλεις δὲ δὴ τί δρᾶν ἀνήκεστον κακόν;
On death; the means thereto must I devise myself.	θανεῖν· ὅπως δέ, τοῦτ’ ἐγὼ βουλεύσομαι.
Hush!	εὔφημος ἴσθι.
Do thou at least advise me well.	καὶ σύ γ’ εὖ με νουθέτει.
For this very day shall I gladden Cypris, my destroyer, by yielding up my life, and shall own myself vanquished by cruel love. Yet shall my dying be another’s curse, that he may learn not to exult at my misfortunes;	ἐγὼ δὲ Κύπριν, ἥπερ ἐξόλλυσί με, ψυχῆς ἀπαλλαχθεῖσα τῇδ’ ἐν ἡμέρᾳ τέρψω· πικροῦ δ’ ἔρωτος ἡσσηθήσομαι. ἀτὰρ κακόν γε χἁτέρῳ γενήσομαι θανοῦσ’, ἵν’ εἰδῇ μὴ ’πὶ τοῖς ἐμοῖς κακοῖς
but when he comes to share the self-same plague with me, he will take a lesson in wisdom.	ὑψηλὸς εἶναι· τῆς νόσου δὲ τῆσδέ μοι κοινῇ μετασχὼν σωφρονεῖν μαθήσεται.
O to be nestling ’neath some pathless cavern, there by god’s creating hand to grow into a bird amid the winged tribes!	Ἠλιβάτοις ὑπὸ κευθμῶσι γενοίμαν, ἵνα με πτεροῦσσαν ὄρνιν ἀγέλῃσι ποταναῖς θεὸς ἐνθείη·
Away would I soar to Adrians wave-beat shore and to the waters of Eridanus; where a father’s hapless daughters in their grief for Phaethon	ἀρθείην δ’ ἐπὶ πόντιον κῦμα τᾶς Ἀδριηνᾶς ἀκτᾶς Ἠριδανοῦ θ’ ὕδωρ· ἔνθα πορφύρεον σταλάσ- σουσιν ἐς οἶδμα πατρὸς τάλαι- ναι κόραι Φαέθοντος οἴ-
distil into the glooming flood the amber brilliance of their tears.	κτῳ δακρύων τὰς ἠλεκτροφαεῖς αὐγάς.
And to the apple-bearing strand of those minstrels in the west I then would come, where ocean’s lord	Ἑσπερίδων δ’ ἐπὶ μηλόσπορον ἀκτὰν ἀνύσαιμι τᾶν ἀοιδῶν, ἵν’ ὁ ποντο- μέδων πορφυρέας λίμνας
no more to sailors grants a passage o’er the deep dark main, finding there the heaven’s holy bound, upheld by Atlas, where water from ambrosial founts wells up beside the couch of Zeus inside his halls,	ναύταις οὐκέθ’ ὁδὸν νέμει, σεμνὸν τέρμονα κυρῶν οὐρανοῦ, τὸν Ἄτλας ἔχει· κρῆναί τ’ ἀμβρόσιαι χέον- ται Ζηνὸς μελάθρων παρὰ κοί-
and holy earth, the bounteous mother, causes joy to spring in heavenly breasts.	ταις, ἵν’ ἁ βιόδωρος αὔ- ξει ζαθέα χθὼν εὐδαιμονίαν θεοῖς.
O white-winged bark, that o’er the booming ocean-wave didst bring	ὦ λευκόπτερε Κρησία πορθμίς, ἃ διὰ πόντιον κῦμ’ ἁλίκτυπον ἅλμας
my royal mistress from her happy home, to crown her queen ’mongst sorrow’s brides! Surely evil omens from either port, at least from Crete, were with that ship, what time to glorious Athens it sped its way,	ἐπόρευσας ἐμὰν ἄνασσαν ὀλβίων ἀπ’ οἴκων, κακονυμφοτάταν ὄνασιν. ἦ γὰρ ἀπ’ ἀμφοτέρων ἁ Κρησίας ἐκ γᾶς δύσορ- νις ἔπτατο κλεινὰς Ἀθή- νας· Μουνίχου δ’ ἀκταῖσιν ἐκ-
and the crew made fast its twisted cable-ends upon the beach of Munychus, and on the land stept out.	δήσαντο πλεκτὰς πεισμάτων ἀρχάς, ἐπ’ ἀ- πείρου τε γᾶς ἔβασαν.
Whence comes it that her heart	ἀνθ’ ὧν, οὐχ ὁσίων ἐρώ-
is crushed, cruelly afflicted by Aphrodite with unholy love; so she by bitter grief o’erwhelmed will tie a noose within her bridal bower to fit it to her fair white neck,	των δεινᾷ φρένας Ἀφροδί- τας νόσῳ κατεκλάσθη· χαλεπᾷ δ’ ὑπέραντλος οὖσα συμφορᾷ τεράμνων ἀπὸ νυμφιδίων κρεμαστὸν ἅψεται ἀμφὶ βρόχον λευκᾷ καθαρμόζουσα δεί-
too modest for this hateful lot in life, prizing o’er all her name and fame, and striving thus to rid her soul of passion’s sting. 	ρᾳ, δαίμονα στυγνὸν καται- δεσθεῖσα, τὰν δ’ εὔδοξον ἀνθ- αιρουμένα φήμαν, ἀπαλ- λάσσουσά τ’ ἀλ- γεινὸν φρενῶν ἔρωτα.
Help! ho! To the rescue all who near the palace stand! She hath hung herself, our queen, the wife of Theseus.	ἰοὺ ἰού· βοηδρομεῖτε πάντες οἱ πέλας δόμων· ἐν ἀγχόναις δέσποινα, Θησέως δάμαρ.
Woe worth the day! the deed is done; our royal mistress is no more, dead she hangs in the dangling noose.	— φεῦ φεῦ, πέπρακται· βασιλὶς οὐκέτ’ ἔστι δὴ γυνή, κρεμαστοῖς ἐν βρόχοις ἠρτημένη.
Haste! some one bring a two-edged knife wherewith to cut the knot about her neck!	οὐ σπεύσετ’; οὐκ οἴσει τις ἀμφιδέξιον σίδηρον, ᾧ τόδ’ ἅμμα λύσομεν δέρης;
Friends, what shall we do? think you we should enter the house, and loose the queen from the tight-drawn noose?	— φίλαι, τί δρῶμεν; ἢ δοκεῖ περᾶν δόμους λῦσαί τ’ ἄνασσαν ἐξ ἐπισπαστῶν βρόχων;
Why should we? Are there not young servants here?	— τί δ’; οὐ πάρεισι πρόσπολοι νεανίαι;
To do too much is not a safe course in life.	τὸ πολλὰ πράσσειν οὐκ ἐν ἀσφαλεῖ βίου.
Lay out the hapless corpse, straighten the limbs. This was a bitter way to sit at home and keep my master’s house!	ὀρθώσατ’ ἐκτείνοντες ἄθλιον νέκυν· πικρὸν τόδ’ οἰκούρημα δεσπόταις ἐμοῖς.
She is dead, poor lady, so I hear. Already are they laying out the corpse.	— ὄλωλεν ἡ δύστηνος, ὡς κλύω, γυνή· ἤδη γὰρ ὡς νεκρόν νιν ἐκτείνουσι δή.
Ladies, can ye tell me what the uproar in the palace means? There came the sound of servants weeping bitterly to mine ear. None of my household deign to open wide the gates and give me glad welcome as a traveller from prophetic shrines.	γυναῖκες, ἴστε τίς ποτ’ ἐν δόμοις βοή; ἠχὼ βαρεῖα προσπόλων ἀφίκετο. οὐ γάρ τί μ’ ὡς θεωρὸν ἀξιοῖ δόμος πύλας ἀνοίξας εὐφρόνως προσεννέπειν.
Hath aught befallen old Pittheus?	μῶν Πιτθέως τι γῆρας εἴργασται νέον;
No. Though he be well advanced in years, yet should I mourn, were he to quit this house.	πρόσω μὲν ἤδη βίοτος, ἀλλ’ ὅμως ἔτ’ ἂν λυπηρὸς ἡμῖν τούσδ’ ἂν ἐκλίποι δόμους.
’Tis not against the old, Theseus, that fate, to strike thee, aims this blow; prepare thy sorrow for a younger corpse.	οὐκ ἐς γέροντας ἥδε σοι τείνει τύχη, Θησεῦ· νέοι θανόντες ἀλγυνοῦσί σε.
Woe is me! is it a child’s life death robs me of?	οἴμοι· τέκνων μοι μή τι συλᾶται βίος;
They live; but, cruellest news of all for thee, their mother is no more.	ζῶσιν, θανούσης μητρὸς ὡς ἄλγιστά σοι.
What! my wife dead? By what cruel mischance?	τί φῄς; ὄλωλεν ἄλοχος; ἐκ τίνος τύχης;
About her neck she tied the hangman’s knot.	βρόχον κρεμαστὸν ἀγχόνης ἀνήψατο.
Had grief so chilled her blood? or what had befallen her?	λύπῃ παχνωθεῖσ’, ἢ ἀπὸ συμφορᾶς τινος;
I know but this, for I am myself but now arrived at the house	τοσοῦτον ἴσμεν· ἄρτι γὰρ κἀγὼ δόμοις,
to mourn thy sorrows, O Theseus.	Θησεῦ, πάρειμι σῶν κακῶν πενθήτρια.
Woe is me! why have I crowned my head with woven garlands, when misfortune greets my embassage? Unbolt the doors, servants,	αἰαῖ· τί δῆτα τοῖσδ’ ἀνέστεμμαι κάρα πλεκτοῖσι φύλλοις, δυστυχὴς θεωρὸς ὤν; χαλᾶτε κλῇθρα, πρόσπολοι, πυλωμάτων,
loose their fastenings, that I may see the piteous sight,	ἐκλύεθ’ ἁρμούς, ὡς ἴδω πικρὰν θέαν
my wife, whose death is death to me.	γυναικός, ἥ με κατθανοῦσ’ ἀπώλεσεν.
Woe! woe is thee for thy piteous lot! thou hast done thyself a hurt deep enough to overthrow this family. Ah! ah! the daring of it! done to death by violence and unnatural means, the desperate effort	— ἰὼ ἰὼ τάλαινα μελέων κακῶν· ἔπαθες, εἰργάσω τοσοῦτον ὥστε τούσδε συγχέαι δόμους. — αἰαῖ τόλμας, ὦ βιαίως θανοῦσ’ ἀνοσίῳ τε συμφορᾷ, σᾶς χερὸς
of thy own poor hand! Who cast the shadow o’er thy life, poor lady?	πάλαισμα μελέας. — τίς ἄρα σάν, τάλαιν’, ἀμαυροῖ ζόαν;
Ah me, my cruel lot! sorrow hath done her worst on me. O fortune, how heavily hast thou set thy foot on me and on my house,	ὤμοι ἐγὼ πόνων· ἔπαθον, ὦ πόλις, τὰ μάκιστ’ ἐμῶν κακῶν. ὦ τύχα, ὥς μοι βαρεῖα καὶ δόμοις ἐπεστάθης,
by fiendish hands inflicting an unexpected stain? Nay, ’tis complete effacement of my life, making it impossible; for I see, alas! so wide an ocean of grief that I can never swim to shore again, nor breast the tide of this calamity.	κηλὶς ἄφραστος ἐξ ἀλαστόρων τινός. κατακονὰ μὲν οὖν ἀβίοτος βίου· κακῶν δ’, ὢ τάλας, πέλαγος εἰσορῶ τοσοῦτον ὥστε μήποτ’ ἐκνεῦσαι πάλιν, μηδ’ ἐκπερᾶσαι κῦμα τῆσδε συμφορᾶς.
How shall I speak of thee, my poor wife, what tale of direst suffering tell? Thou art vanished like a bird from the covert of my hand, taking one headlong leap from me to Hades’ halls.	τίνα λόγον τάλας, τίνα τύχαν σέθεν βαρύποτμον, γύναι, προσαυδῶν τύχω; ὄρνις γὰρ ὥς τις ἐκ χερῶν ἄφαντος εἶ, πήδημ’ ἐς Ἅιδου κραιπνὸν ὁρμήσασά μοι.
Alas, and woe! this is a bitter, bitter sight! This must be a judgment sent by God for the sins of an ancestor, which from some far source I am bringing on myself.	αἰαῖ αἰαῖ, μέλεα μέλεα τάδε πάθη. πρόσωθεν δέ ποθεν ἀνακομίζομαι τύχαν δαιμόνων ἀμπλακίαισι τῶν πάροιθέν τινος.
My prince, ’tis not to thee alone such sorrows come;	οὐ σοὶ τάδ’, ὦναξ, ἦλθε δὴ μόνῳ κακά,
thou hast lost a noble wife, but so have many others.	πολλῶν μετ’ ἄλλων δ’ ὤλεσας κεδνὸν λέχος.
Fain would I go hide me ’neath earth’s blackest depth, to dwell in darkness with the dead in misery, now that I am reft of thy dear presence! for thou hast slain me than thyself e’en more.	τὸ κατὰ γᾶς θέλω, τὸ κατὰ γᾶς κνέφας μετοικεῖν σκότῳ θανὼν ὁ τλάμων, τῆς σῆς στερηθεὶς φιλτάτης ὁμιλίας· ἀπώλεσας γὰρ μᾶλλον ἢ κατέφθισο.
Who can tell me what caused the fatal stroke that reached thy heart, dear wife? Will no one tell me what befell?	τίνος κλύω; πόθεν θανάσιμος τύχα, γύναι, σὰν ἔβα, τάλαινα, καρδίαν; εἴποι τις ἂν τὸ πραχθέν, ἢ μάτην ὄχλον στέγει τύραννον δῶμα προσπόλων ἐμῶν; ὤμοι μοι σέθεν,
doth my palace all in vain give shelter to a herd of menials? Woe, woe for thee, my wife! sorrows  past speech, past bearing, I behold within my house; myself a ruined man, my home a solitude, my children orphans!	μέλεος, οἷον εἶδον ἄλγος δόμων, οὐ τλητὸν οὐδὲ ῥητόν. ἀλλ’ ἀπωλόμην· ἔρημος οἶκος, καὶ τέκν’ ὀρφανεύεται.
Gone and left us hast thou, fondest wife and noblest of all women	ἔλιπες οὓς ἔτεκες, ἔλιπες, ὦ φίλα γυναικῶν ἀρίστα θ’ ὁπόσας ὁρᾷ
’neath the sun’s bright eye or night’s star-lit radiance.	φέγγος ἀελίου τε καὶ νυκτὸς ἀστερωπὸν σέλας.
Poor house, what sorrows are thy portion now! My eyes are wet with streams of tears to see thy fate;	ἰὼ τάλας· ὦ τάλας· ὅσον κακὸν ἔχει δόμος. δάκρυσί μου βλέφαρα καταχυθέντα τέγγεται σᾷ τύχᾳ·
but the sequel to this tragedy has long with terror filled me.	τὸ δ’ ἐπὶ τῷδε πῆμα φρίσσω πάλαι.
Ha! what means this letter? clasped in her dear hand it hath some strange tale to tell. Hath she, poor lady, as a last request, written her bidding as to my marriage and her children?	ἔα ἔα· τί δή ποθ’ ἥδε δέλτος ἐκ φίλης χερὸς ἠρτημένη; θέλει τι σημῆναι νέον; ἀλλ’ ἦ λέχους μοι καὶ τέκνων ἐπιστολὰς ἔγραψεν ἡ δύστηνος, ἐξαιτουμένη;
Take heart, poor ghost; no wife henceforth shall wed thy Theseus or invade his house. Ah! how yon seal of my dead wife stamped with her golden ring affects my sight! Come, I will unfold the sealed packet	θάρσει, τάλαινα· λέκτρα γὰρ τὰ Θησέως οὐκ ἔστι δῶμά θ’ ἥτις εἴσεισιν γυνή. καὶ μὴν τύποι γε σφενδόνης χρυσηλάτου τῆς οὐκέτ’ οὔσης τῆσδε προσσαίνουσί με. φέρ’, ἐξελίξας περιβολὰς σφραγισμάτων
and read her letter’s message to me.	ἴδω τί λέξαι δέλτος ἥδε μοι θέλει.
Woe unto us! Here is yet another evil in the train by heaven sent. Looking to what has happened, I should count my lot in life no longer worth one’s while to gain. My master’s house,	— φεῦ φεῦ· τόδ’ αὖ νεοχμὸν ἐκδοχαῖς ἐπιφέρει θεὸς κακόν. ἐμοὶ μὲν οὖν ἀβίοτος βίου τύχα πρὸς τὸ κρανθέν· εἴη τυχεῖν. — ὀλομένους γάρ, οὐκέτ’ ὄντας λέγω,
alas! is ruined, brought to naught, I say. Spare it, O Heaven, if it may be. Hearken to my prayer, for I see, as with prophetic eye, an omen boding mischief.	φεῦ φεῦ, τῶν ἐμῶν τυράννων δόμους. — ὦ δαῖμον, εἴ πως ἔστι, μὴ σφήλῃς δόμους, αἰτουμένης δὲ κλῦθί μου· πρὸς γάρ τινος οἰωνὸν ὥστε μάντις εἰσορῶ κακοῦ.
O horror! woe on woe!	οἴμοι· τόδ’ οἷον ἄλλο πρὸς κακῷ κακόν,
and still they come, too deep for words, too heavy to bear. Ah me!	οὐ τλητὸν οὐδὲ λεκτόν. ὦ τάλας ἐγώ.
What is it? speak, if I may share in it.	τί χρῆμα; λέξον, εἴ τί μοι λόγου μέτα.
This letter loudly tells a hideous tale! where can I escape my load of woe? For I am ruined and undone, so awful are the words I find here written clear	βοᾷ βοᾷ δέλτος ἄλαστα. πᾷ φύγω βάρος κακῶν; ἀπὸ γὰρ ὀλόμενος οἴχομαι, οἷον οἷον εἶδον γραφαῖς μέλος
as if she cried them to me; woe is me!	φθεγγόμενον τλάμων.
Alas! thy words declare themselves the harbingers of woe.	αἰαῖ, κακῶν ἀρχηγὸν ἐκφαίνεις λόγον.
I can no longer keep the cursed tale within the portal of my lips, cruel though its utterance be. Ah me!	τόδε μὲν οὐκέτι στόματος ἐν πύλαις καθέξω δυσεκπέρατον, ὀλοὸν κακόν· ἰὼ πόλις.
Hippolytus hath dared by brutal force to violate my honour, recking naught of Zeus, whose awful eye is over all. O father Poseidon, once didst thou promise to fulfil three prayers of mine ; answer one of these and slay my son, let him not escape this single day,	Ἱππόλυτος εὐνῆς τῆς ἐμῆς ἔτλη θιγεῖν βίᾳ, τὸ σεμνὸν Ζηνὸς ὄμμ’ ἀτιμάσας. ἀλλ’, ὦ πάτερ Πόσειδον, ἃς ἐμοί ποτε ἀρὰς ὑπέσχου τρεῖς, μιᾷ κατέργασαι τούτων ἐμὸν παῖδ’, ἡμέραν δὲ μὴ φύγοι
if the prayers thou gavest me were indeed with issue fraught.	τήνδ’, εἴπερ ἡμῖν ὤπασας σαφεῖς ἀράς.
O king, I do conjure thee, call back that prayer; hereafter thou wilt know thy error. Hear, I pray.	ἄναξ, ἀπεύχου ταῦτα πρὸς θεῶν πάλιν· γνώσῃ γὰρ αὖθις ἀμπλακών. ἐμοὶ πιθοῦ.
Impossible! Moreover I will banish him from this land, and by one of two fates shall he be struck down;	οὐκ ἔστι· καὶ πρός γ’ ἐξελῶ σφε τῆσδε γῆς, δυοῖν δὲ μοίραιν θατέρᾳ πεπλήξεται·
either Poseidon, out of respect to my prayer, will cast his dead body into the house of Hades; or exiled from this land, a wanderer to some foreign shore, shall he eke out a life of misery.	ἢ γὰρ Ποσειδῶν αὐτὸν εἰς Ἅιδου δόμους θανόντα πέμψει τὰς ἐμὰς ἀρὰς σέβων, ἢ τῆσδε χώρας ἐκπεσὼν ἀλώμενος ξένην ἐπ’ αἶαν λυπρὸν ἀντλήσει βίον.
Lo! where himself doth come, thy son Hippolytus, in good time;	καὶ μὴν ὅδ’ αὐτὸς παῖς σὸς ἐς καιρὸν πάρα,
dismiss thy hurtful rage, King Theseus, and bethink thee what is best for thy family.	Ἱππόλυτος· ὀργῆς δ’ ἐξανεὶς κακῆς, ἄναξ Θησεῦ, τὸ λῷστον σοῖσι βούλευσαι δόμοις.
I heard thy voice, father, and hasted to come hither; yet know I not the cause of thy present sorrow, but would fain learn of thee.	κραυγῆς ἀκούσας σῆς ἀφικόμην, πάτερ, σπουδῇ· τὸ μέντοι πρᾶγμ’ ἐφ’ ᾧτινι στένεις οὐκ οἶδα, βουλοίμην δ’ ἂν ἐκ σέθεν κλύειν.
Ha! what is this? thy wife a corpse I see; this is passing strange; ’twas but now I left her; a moment since she looked upon the light.	ἔα, τί χρῆμα; σὴν δάμαρθ’ ὁρῶ, πάτερ, νεκρόν· μεγίστου θαύματος τόδ’ ἄξιον· ἣν ἀρτίως ἔλειπον, ἣ φάος τόδε οὔπω χρόνον παλαιὸν εἰσεδέρκετο.
How came she thus? the manner of her death?	τί χρῆμα πάσχει; τῷ τρόπῳ διόλλυται;
this would I learn of thee, father. Art dumb? silence availeth not in trouble; nay, for the heart that fain would know all must show its curiosity even in sorrow’s hour. Be sure it is not right, father,	πάτερ, πυθέσθαι βούλομαι σέθεν πάρα. σιγᾷς· σιωπῆς δ’ οὐδὲν ἔργον ἐν κακοῖς· ἡ γὰρ ποθοῦσα πάντα καρδία κλύειν κἀν τοῖς κακοῖσι λίχνος οὖσ’ ἁλίσκεται. οὐ μὴν φίλους γε κἄτι μᾶλλον ἢ φίλους
to hide misfortunes from those who love, ay, more than love thee.	κρύπτειν δίκαιον σάς, πάτερ, δυσπραξίας.
O ye sons of men, victims of a thousand idle errors,  why teach your countless crafts, why scheme and seek to find a way for everything, while one thing ye know not nor ever yet have made your prize,	ὦ πόλλ’ ἁμαρτάνοντες ἄνθρωποι μάτην, τί δὴ τέχνας μὲν μυρίας διδάσκετε καὶ πάντα μηχανᾶσθε κἀξευρίσκετε, ἓν δ’ οὐκ ἐπίστασθ’ οὐδ’ ἐθηράσασθέ πω,
a way to teach them wisdom whose souls are void of sense?	φρονεῖν διδάσκειν οἷσιν οὐκ ἔνεστι νοῦς;
A very master in his craft the man, who can force fools to be wise! But these ill-timed subtleties of thine, father, make me fear thy tongue is running riot through trouble.	δεινὸν σοφιστὴν εἶπας, ὅστις εὖ φρονεῖν τοὺς μὴ φρονοῦντας δυνατός ἐστ’ ἀναγκάσαι. ἀλλ’ οὐ γὰρ ἐν δέοντι λεπτουργεῖς, πάτερ, δέδοικα μή σου γλῶσσ’ ὑπερβάλῃ κακοῖς.
Fie upon thee! man needs should have some certain test set up to try his friends, some touchstone of their hearts, to know each friend whether he be true or false; all men should have two voices, one the voice of honesty, expediency’s the other,	φεῦ, χρῆν βροτοῖσι τῶν φίλων τεκμήριον σαφές τι κεῖσθαι καὶ διάγνωσιν φρενῶν, ὅστις τ’ ἀληθής ἐστιν ὅς τε μὴ φίλος, δισσάς τε φωνὰς πάντας ἀνθρώπους ἔχειν, τὴν μὲν δικαίαν, τὴν δ’ ὅπως ἐτύγχανεν,
so would honesty confute its knavish opposite, and then we could not be deceived.	ὡς ἡ φρονοῦσα τἄδικ’ ἐξηλέγχετο πρὸς τῆς δικαίας, κοὐκ ἂν ἠπατώμεθα.
Say, hath some friend been slandering me and hath he still thine ear? am I, though guiltless, banned? I am amazed indeed;	ἀλλ’ ἦ τις ἐς σὸν οὖς με διαβαλὼν ἔχει φίλων, νοσοῦμεν δ’ οὐδὲν ὄντες αἴτιοι; ἔκ τοι πέπληγμαι· σοὶ γὰρ ἐκπλήσσουσί με
thy random, frantic words fill me with wild alarm.	λόγοι παραλλάσσοντες ἔξεδροι φρενῶν.
O the mind of mortal man! to what lengths will it proceed? What limit will its bold assurance have? for if it goes on growing as man’s life advances, and each successor outdo the man before him	φεῦ τῆς βροτείας· ποῖ προβήσεται; φρενός. τί τέρμα τόλμης καὶ θράσους γενήσεται; εἰ γὰρ κατ’ ἀνδρὸς βίοτον ἐξογκώσεται, ὁ δ’ ὕστερος τοῦ πρόσθεν εἰς ὑπερβολὴν
in villainy, the gods will have to add another sphere unto the world, which shall take in the knaves and villains.	πανοῦργος ἔσται, θεοῖσι προσβαλεῖν χθονὶ ἄλλην δεήσει γαῖαν, ἣ χωρήσεται τοὺς μὴ δικαίους καὶ κακοὺς πεφυκότας.
Behold this man; he, my own son, hath outraged mine honour, his guilt most clearly proved	σκέψασθε δ’ ἐς τόνδ’, ὅστις ἐξ ἐμοῦ γεγὼς ᾔσχυνε τἀμὰ λέκτρα κἀξελέγχεται
by my dead wife. Now, since thou hast dared this loathly crime, come, look thy father in the face. Art thou the man who dost with gods consort, as one above the vulgar herd? art thou the chaste and sinless saint?	πρὸς τῆς θανούσης ἐμφανῶς κάκιστος ὤν. δεῖξον δ’, ἐπειδή γ’ ἐς μίασμ’ ἐλήλυθας, τὸ σὸν πρόσωπον δεῦρ’ ἐναντίον πατρί. σὺ δὴ θεοῖσιν ὡς περισσὸς ὢν ἀνὴρ ξύνει; σὺ σώφρων καὶ κακῶν ἀκήρατος;
Thy boasts will never persuade me to be guilty of attributing ignorance to gods. Go then, vaunt thyself, and drive1 thy petty trade in viands formed of lifeless food; take Orpheus for thy chief and go a-revelling, with all honour for the vapourings of many a written scroll,	οὐκ ἂν πιθοίμην τοῖσι σοῖς κόμποις ἐγὼ θεοῖσι προσθεὶς ἀμαθίαν φρονεῖν κακῶς. ἤδη νυν αὔχει καὶ δι’ ἀψύχου βορᾶς σίτοις καπήλευ’, Ὀρφέα τ’ ἄνακτ’ ἔχων βάκχευε πολλῶν γραμμάτων τιμῶν καπνούς·
seeing thou now art caught. Let all beware, I say, of such hypocrites! who hunt their prey with fine words, and all the while are scheming villainy. She is dead; dost think that this will save thee? Why this convicts thee more than all, abandoned wretch!	ἐπεί γ’ ἐλήφθης. τοὺς δὲ τοιούτους ἐγὼ φεύγειν προφωνῶ πᾶσι· θηρεύουσι γὰρ σεμνοῖς λόγοισιν, αἰσχρὰ μηχανώμενοι. τέθνηκεν ἥδε· τοῦτό σ’ ἐκσώσειν δοκεῖς; ἐν τῷδ’ ἁλίσκῃ πλεῖστον, ὦ κάκιστε σύ·
What oaths, what pleas can outweigh this letter, so that thou shouldst ’scape thy doom? Thou wilt assert she hated thee, that ’twixt the bastard and the true-born child nature has herself put war; it seems then by thy showing she made a sorry bargain with her life,	ποῖοι γὰρ ὅρκοι κρείσσονες, τίνες λόγοι τῆσδ’ ἂν γένοιντ’ ἄν, ὥστε σ’ αἰτίαν φυγεῖν; μισεῖν σε φήσεις τήνδε καὶ τὸ δὴ νόθον τοῖς γνησίοισι πολέμιον πεφυκέναι· κακὴν ἄρ’ αὐτὴν ἔμπορον βίου λέγεις,
if to gratify her hate of thee she lost what most she prized. ’Tis said, no doubt, that frailty finds no place in man but is innate in woman; my experience is, young men are no more secure than women, whenso the Queen of Love excites a youthful breast;	εἰ δυσμενείᾳ σῇ τὰ φίλτατ’ ὤλεσεν. ἀλλ’ ὡς τὸ μῶρον ἀνδράσιν μὲν οὐκ ἔνι, γυναιξὶ δ’ ἐμπέφυκεν; οἶδ’ ἐγὼ νέους, οὐδὲν γυναικῶν ὄντας ἀσφαλεστέρους, ὅταν ταράξῃ Κύπρις ἡβῶσαν φρένα·
although their sex comes in to help them. Yet why do I thus bandy words with thee, when before me lies the corpse, to be the clearest witness? Begone at once, an exile from this land, and ne’er set foot again in god-built Athens	τὸ δ’ ἄρσεν αὐτοὺς ὠφελεῖ προσκείμενον. νῦν οὖν — τί ταῦτα σοῖς ἁμιλλῶμαι λόγοις νεκροῦ παρόντος μάρτυρος σαφεστάτου; ἔξερρε γαίας τῆσδ’ ὅσον τάχος φυγάς, καὶ μήτ’ Ἀθήνας τὰς θεοδμήτους μόλῃς,
nor in the confines of my dominion. For if I am tamely to submit to this treatment from such as thee, no more will Sinis, robber of the Isthmus, bear me witness how I slew him, but say my boasts are idle, nor will those rocks Scironian, that fringe the sea,	μήτ’ εἰς ὅρους γῆς ἧς ἐμὸν κρατεῖ δόρυ. εἰ γὰρ παθών γε σοῦ τάδ’ ἡσσηθήσομαι, οὐ μαρτυρήσει μ’ Ἴσθμιος Σίνις ποτὲ κτανεῖν ἑαυτόν, ἀλλὰ κομπάζειν μάτην, οὐδ’ αἱ θαλάσσῃ σύννομοι Σκιρωνίδες
call me the miscreants’ scourge.	φήσουσι πέτραι τοῖς κακοῖς μ’ εἶναι βαρύν.
I know not how to call happy any child of man; for that which was first has turned and now is last.	οὐκ οἶδ’ ὅπως εἴποιμ’ ἂν εὐτυχεῖν τινα θνητῶν· τὰ γὰρ δὴ πρῶτ’ ἀνέστραπται πάλιν.
Father, thy wrath and the tension of thy mind are terrible; yet this charge, specious though its arguments appear,	πάτερ, μένος μὲν ξύστασίς τε σῶν φρενῶν δεινή· τὸ μέντοι πρᾶγμ’ ἔχον καλοὺς λόγους,
becomes a calumny, if one lay it bare. Small skill  have I in speaking to a crowd, but have a readier wit for comrades of mine own age and small companies. Yea, and this is as it should be; for they, whom the wise despise, are better qualified to speak before a mob.	εἴ τις διαπτύξειεν, οὐ καλὸν τόδε. ἐγὼ δ’ ἄκομψος εἰς ὄχλον δοῦναι λόγον, ἐς ἥλικας δὲ κὠλίγους σοφώτερος. ἔχει δὲ μοῖραν καὶ τόδ’· οἱ γὰρ ἐν σοφοῖς φαῦλοι παρ’ ὄχλῳ μουσικώτεροι λέγειν.
Yet am I constrained under the present circumstances to break silence. And at the outset will I take the point which formed the basis of thy stealthy attack on me, designed to put me out of court unheard; dost see yon sun, this earth? These do not contain,	ὅμως δ’ ἀνάγκη, ξυμφορᾶς ἀφιγμένης, γλῶσσάν μ’ ἀφεῖναι. πρῶτα δ’ ἄρξομαι λέγειν, ὅθεν μ’ ὑπῆλθες πρῶτον ὡς διαφθερῶν κοὐκ ἀντιλέξοντ’. εἰσορᾷς φάος τόδε καὶ γαῖαν· ἐν τοῖσδ’ οὐκ ἔνεστ’ ἀνὴρ ἐμοῦ,
for all thou dost deny it, chastity surpassing mine. To reverence God I count the highest knowledge, and to adopt as friends not those who attempt injustice, but such as would blush to propose to their companions aught disgraceful or pleasure them by shameful services;	οὐδ’ ἢν σὺ μὴ φῇς, σωφρονέστερος γεγώς. ἐπίσταμαι γὰρ πρῶτα μὲν θεοὺς σέβειν, φίλοις τε χρῆσθαι μὴ ἀδικεῖν πειρωμένοις, ἀλλ’ οἷσιν αἰδὼς μήτ’ ἐπαγγέλλειν κακὰ μήτ’ ἀνθυπουργεῖν αἰσχρὰ τοῖσι χρωμένοις·
to mock at friends is not my way, father, but I am still the same behind their backs as to their face. The very crime thou thinkest to catch me in, is just the one I am untainted with, for to this day have I kept me pure from women. Nor know I aught thereof, save what I hear	οὐκ ἐγγελαστὴς τῶν ὁμιλούντων, πάτερ, ἀλλ’ αὑτὸς οὐ παροῦσι κἀγγὺς ὢν φίλοις. ἑνὸς δ’ ἄθικτος, ᾧ με νῦν ἑλεῖν δοκεῖς· λέχους γὰρ ἐς τόδ’ ἡμέρας ἁγνὸν δέμας· οὐκ οἶδα πρᾶξιν τήνδε πλὴν λόγῳ κλύων
or see in pictures, for I have no wish to look even on these, so pure my virgin soul. I grant my claim to chastity may not convince thee; well, ’tis then for thee to show the way I was corrupted. Did this woman exceed in beauty	γραφῇ τε λεύσσων· οὐδὲ ταῦτα γὰρ σκοπεῖν πρόθυμός εἰμι, παρθένον ψυχὴν ἔχων. καὶ δὴ τὸ σῶφρον τοὐμὸν οὐ πείθει σ’· ἴτω· δεῖ δή σε δεῖξαι τῷ τρόπῳ διεφθάρην. πότερα τὸ τῆσδε σῶμ’ ἐκαλλιστεύετο
all her sex? Did I aspire to fill the husband’s place after thee and succeed to thy house?	πασῶν γυναικῶν; ἢ σὸν οἰκήσειν δόμον ἔγκληρον εὐνὴν προσλαβὼν ἐπήλπισα; μάταιος ἆρ’ ἦν, οὐδαμοῦ μὲν οὖν φρενῶν. ἀλλ’ ὡς τυραννεῖν ἡδύ; τοῖσι σώφροσιν ἥκιστά γ’, εἰ μὴ τὰς φρένας διέφθορεν
One thing I have not said, the rest thou hast. Had I a witness to attest my purity, and were I pitted ’gainst her still alive, facts would show thee on enquiry who the culprit was.	ἓν οὐ λέλεκται τῶν ἐμῶν, τὰ δ’ ἄλλ’ ἔχεις· εἰ μὲν γὰρ ἦν μοι μάρτυς οἷός εἰμ’ ἐγώ, καὶ τῆσδ’ ὁρώσης φέγγος ἠγωνιζόμην, ἔργοις ἂν εἶδες τοὺς κακοὺς διεξιών·
Now by Zeus, the god of oaths, and by the earth, whereon we stand, I swear to thee I never did lay hand upon thy wife nor would have wished to, or have harboured such a thought Slay me, ye gods! rob me of name and honour, from home and city cast me forth, a wandering exile o’er the earth!	νῦν δ’ ὅρκιόν σοι Ζῆνα καὶ πέδον χθονὸς ὄμνυμι τῶν σῶν μήποθ’ ἅψασθαι γάμων μηδ’ ἂν θελῆσαι μηδ’ ἂν ἔννοιαν λαβεῖν. ἦ τἄρ’ ὀλοίμην ἀκλεὴς ἀνώνυμος, ἄπολις ἄοικος, φυγὰς ἀλητεύων χθόνα,
nor sea nor land receive my bones when I am dead, if I am such a miscreant! I cannot say if she through fear destroyed herself, for more than this am I forbid. With her discretion took the place of chastity,	καὶ μήτε πόντος μήτε γῆ δέξαιτό μου σάρκας θανόντος, εἰ κακὸς πέφυκ’ ἀνήρ. εἰ δ’ ἥδε δειμαίνουσ’ ἀπώλεσεν βίον οὐκ οἶδ’· ἐμοὶ γὰρ οὐ θέμις πέρα λέγειν. ἐσωφρόνησεν οὐκ ἔχουσα σωφρονεῖν,
while I, though chaste, was not discreet in using this virtue.	ἡμεῖς δ’ ἔχοντες οὐ καλῶς ἐχρώμεθα.
Thy oath by heaven, strong security, sufficiently refutes the charge.	ἀρκοῦσαν εἶπας αἰτίας ἀποστροφήν, ὅρκους παρασχών, πίστιν οὐ σμικράν, θεῶν.
A wizard or magician must the fellow be, to think he can first flout me, his father,	ἆρ’ οὐκ ἐπῳδὸς καὶ γόης πέφυχ’ ὅδε, ὃς τὴν ἐμὴν πέποιθεν εὐοργησίᾳ
then by coolness master my resolve.	ψυχὴν κρατήσειν, τὸν τεκόντ’ ἀτιμάσας;
Father, thy part in this doth fill me with amaze; wert thou my son and I thy sire, by heaven! I would have slain, not let thee off with banishment, hadst thou presumed to violate my honour.	καὶ σοῦ γε ταὐτὰ κάρτα θαυμάζω, πάτερ· εἰ γὰρ σὺ μὲν παῖς ἦσθ’, ἐγὼ δὲ σὸς πατήρ, ἔκτεινά τοί σ’ ἂν κοὐ φυγαῖς ἐζημίουν, εἴπερ γυναικὸς ἠξίουν σ’ ἐμῆς θιγεῖν.
A just remark! yet shalt thou not die by the sentence thine own lips pronounce upon thyself; for death,  that cometh in a moment, is an easy end for wretchedness. Nay, thou shalt be exiled from thy fatherland,	ὡς ἄξιον τόδ’ εἶπας· οὐχ οὕτω θανῇ. ταχὺς γὰρ Ἅιδης ῥᾷστος ἀνδρὶ δυστυχεῖ· ἀλλ’ ἐκ πατρῴας φυγὰς ἀλητεύων χθονὸς ὥσπερ σὺ σαυτῷ τόνδε προύθηκας νόμον —
Oh! what wilt thou do? Wilt thou banish me, without so much as waiting for Time’s evidence on my case?	οἴμοι, τί δράσεις; οὐδὲ μηνυτὴν χρόνον δέξῃ καθ’ ἡμῶν, ἀλλά μ’ ἐξελᾷς χθονός;
Ay, beyond the sea, beyond the bounds of Atlas, if I could, so deeply do I hate thee.	πέραν γε πόντου καὶ τόπων Ἀτλαντικῶν, εἴ πως δυναίμην, ὡς σὸν ἐχθαίρω κάρα.
What! banish me untried, without even testing my oath, the pledge I offer, or the voice of seers?	οὐδ’ ὅρκον οὐδὲ πίστιν οὐδὲ μάντεων φήμας ἐλέγξας ἄκριτον ἐκβαλεῖς με γῆς;
This letter here, though it bears no seers’ signs, arraigns thy pledges; as for birds that fly o’er our heads, a long farewell to them.	ἡ δέλτος ἥδε κλῆρον οὐ δεδεγμένη κατηγορεῖ σου πιστά· τοὺς δ’ ὑπὲρ κάρα φοιτῶντας ὄρνις πόλλ’ ἐγὼ χαίρειν λέγω.
Great gods! why do I not unlock my lips, seeing that I am ruined by you, the objects of my reverence? No, I will not; I should nowise persuade those whom I ought to, and in vain should break the oath I swore.	ὦ θεοί, τί δῆτα τοὐμὸν οὐ λύω στόμα, ὅστις γ’ ὑφ’ ὑμῶν, οὓς σέβω, διόλλυμαι; οὐ δῆτα· πάντως οὐ πίθοιμ’ ἂν οὕς με δεῖ, μάτην δ’ ἂν ὅρκους συγχέαιμ’ οὓς ὤμοσα.
Fie upon thee! that solemn air of thine is more than I can bear.	οἴμοι, τὸ σεμνὸν ὥς μ’ ἀποκτενεῖ τὸ σόν.
Begone from thy native land forthwith!	οὐκ εἶ πατρῴας ἐκτὸς ὡς τάχιστα γῆς;
Whither shall I turn? Ah me! whose friendly house will take me in, an exile on so grave a charge?	ποῖ δῆθ’ ὁ τλήμων τρέψομαι; τίνος ξένων δόμους ἔσειμι, τῇδ’ ἐπ’ αἰτίᾳ φυγών;
Seek one who loves to entertain as guests and partners in his crimes corrupters of men’s wives.	ὅστις γυναικῶν λυμεῶνας ἥδεται ξένους κομίζων καὶ ξυνοικούρους κακῶν.
Ah me! this wounds my heart and brings me nigh to tears to think that I should appear so vile, and thou believe me so.	αἰαῖ, πρὸς ἧπαρ· δακρύων ἐγγὺς τόδε, εἰ δὴ κακός γε φαίνομαι, δοκῶ τέ σοι.
Thy tears and forethought had been more in season when thou didst presume to outrage thy father’s wife.	τότε στενάζειν καὶ προγιγνώσκειν σ’ ἐχρῆν ὅτ’ ἐς πατρῴαν ἄλοχον ὑβρίζειν ἔτλης.
O house, I would thou couldst speak for me and witness if I am so vile!	ὦ δώματ’, εἴθε φθέγμα γηρύσαισθέ μοι καὶ μαρτυρήσαιτ’ εἰ κακὸς πέφυκ’ ἀνήρ.
Dost fly to speechless witnesses? This deed, though it speaketh not, proves thy guilt clearly.	ἐς τοὺς ἀφώνους μάρτυρας φεύγεις σοφῶς· τὸ δ’ ἔργον οὐ λέγον σε μηνύει κακόν.
Alas! Would I could stand and face myself, so should I weep to see the sorrows I endure.	φεῦ· εἴθ’ ἦν ἐμαυτὸν προσβλέπειν ἐναντίον στάνθ’, ὡς ἐδάκρυσ’ οἷα πάσχομεν κακά.
Ay, ’tis thy character to honour thyself far more than reverence thy parents, as thou shouldst.	πολλῷ γε μᾶλλον σαυτὸν ἤσκησας σέβειν ἢ τοὺς τεκόντας ὅσια δρᾶν δίκαιος ὤν.
Unhappy mother! son of sorrow! Heaven keep all friends of mine from bastard birth!	ὦ δυστάλαινα μῆτερ, ὦ πικραὶ γοναί· μηδείς ποτ’ εἴη τῶν ἐμῶν φίλων νόθος.
Ho! servants, drag him hence! You heard	οὐχ ἕλξετ’ αὐτόν, δμῶες; οὐκ ἀκούετε
my proclamation long ago condemning him to exile.	πάλαι ξενοῦσθαι τόνδε προυννέποντά με;
Whoso of them doth lay a hand on me shall rue it; thyself expel me, if thy spirit move thee, from the land.	κλαίων τις αὐτῶν ἆρ’ ἐμοῦ τεθίξεται· σὺ δ’ αὐτός, εἴ σοι θυμός, ἐξώθει χθονός.
I will, unless my word thou straight obey; no pity for thy exile steals into my heart.	δράσω τάδ’, εἰ μὴ τοῖς ἐμοῖς πείσῃ λόγοις· οὐ γάρ τις οἶκτος σῆς μ’ ὑπέρχεται φυγῆς.
The sentence then, it seems, is passed. Ah, misery I How well I know the truth herein, but know no way to tell it! O daughter of Latona, dearest to me of all deities, partner, comrade in the chase, far from glorious Athens must I fly. Farewell, city	ἄραρεν, ὡς ἔοικεν· ὦ τάλας ἐγώ· ὡς οἶδα μὲν ταῦτ’, οἶδα δ’ οὐχ ὅπως φράσω. ὦ φιλτάτη μοι δαιμόνων Λητοῦς κόρη, σύνθακε, συγκύναγε, φευξόμεσθα δὴ κλεινὰς Ἀθήνας. ἀλλὰ χαιρέτω πόλις
and land of Erechtheus; farewell, Troezen, most joyous home wherein to pass the spring of life; ’tis my last sight of thee, farewell!	καὶ γαῖ’ Ἐρεχθέως· ὦ πέδον Τροζήνιον, ὡς ἐγκαθηβᾶν πόλλ’ ἔχεις εὐδαίμονα, χαῖρ’· ὕστατον γάρ σ’ εἰσορῶν προσφθέγγομαι.
Come, my comrades in this land, young like me, greet me kindly and escort me forth,	ἴτ’ ὦ νέοι μοι τῆσδε γῆς ὁμήλικες, προσείπαθ’ ἡμᾶς καὶ προπέμψατε χθονός·
for never will ye behold a purer soul, for all my father’s doubts.	ὡς οὔποτ’ ἄλλον ἄνδρα σωφρονέστερον ὄψεσθε, κεἰ μὴ ταῦτ’ ἐμῷ δοκεῖ πατρί.
In very deed the thoughts I have about the gods, whenso they come into my mind, do much to soothe its grief, but though I cherish secret hopes of some great guiding will, yet am I at fault when I survey the fate and doings of the sons of men;	ἦ μέγα μοι τὰ θεῶν μελεδήμαθ’, ὅταν φρένας ἔλθῃ, λύπας παραιρεῖ· ξύνεσιν δέ τιν’ ἐλπίδι κεύθων λείπομαι ἔν τε τύχαις θνατῶν καὶ ἐν ἔργμασι λεύσσων·
change succeeds to change, and man’s life veers and shifts in endless restlessness.	ἄλλα γὰρ ἄλλοθεν ἀμείβεται, μετὰ δ’ ἵσταται ἀνδράσιν αἰὼν πολυπλάνητος αἰεί.
Fortune grant me this, I pray, at heaven’s hand,—a happy lot in life and a soul from sorrow free;	εἴθε μοι εὐξαμένᾳ θεόθεν τάδε μοῖρα παράσχοι, τύχαν μετ’ ὄλβου καὶ ἀκήρατον ἄλγεσι θυμόν·
opinions let me hold not too precise nor yet too hollow; but, lightly changing my habits to each morrow as it comes, may I thus attain a life of bliss!	δόξα δὲ μήτ’ ἀτρεκὴς μήτ’ αὖ παράσημος ἐνείη· ῥᾴδια δ’ ἤθεα τὸν αὔριον μεταβαλλομένα χρόνον αἰεὶ βίον συνευτυχοίην.
For now no more is my mind free from doubts, unlooked-for sights greet my vision; for lo! I see the morning star of Athens, eye of Hellas, driven by his father’s fury	οὐκέτι γὰρ καθαρὰν φρέν’ ἔχω τὰ παρ’ ἐλπίδα λεύσ- σων, ἐπεὶ τὸν Ἑλλανίας φανερώτατον ἀστέρ’ Ἀθήνας εἴδομεν εἴδομεν ἐκ πατρὸς ὀργᾶς
to another land. Mourn, ye sands of my native shores, ye oak-groves on the hills, where with his fleet hounds he would hunt the quarry  to the death,	ἄλλαν ἐπ’ αἶαν ἱέμενον. ὦ ψάμαθοι πολιήτιδος ἀκτᾶς, ὦ δρυμὸς ὄρειος, ὅθι κυνῶν ὠκυπόδων μέτα θῆρας ἔναιρεν
attending on Dictynna, awful queen.	Δίκτυνναν ἀμφὶ σεμνάν.
No more will he mount his car drawn by Venetian steeds, filling the course round Limna with the prancing of his trained horses. Nevermore in his fathers house shall he wake the Muse	οὐκέτι συζυγίαν πώλων Ἐνετᾶν ἐπιβάσῃ τὸν ἀμφὶ Λίμνας τρόχον κατέχων ποδὶ γυμνάδος ἵππου. μοῦσα δ’ ἄυπνος ὑπ’ ἄντυγι χορδᾶν
that never slept beneath his lute-strings; no hand will crown the spots where rests the maiden Latona ’mid the boskage deep; nor evermore shall our virgins vie to win thy love, now thou art banished;	λήξει πατρῷον ἀνὰ δόμον· ἀστέφανοι δὲ κόρας ἀνάπαυλαι Λατοῦς βαθεῖαν ἀνὰ χλόαν· νυμφιδία δ’ ἀπόλωλε φυγᾷ σᾷ λέκτρων ἅμιλλα κούραις.
while I with tears at thy unhappy fate shall endure a lot all undeserved. Ah! hapless mother,	— ἐγὼ δὲ σᾷ δυστυχίᾳ δάκρυσι διοίσω πότμον ἄποτμον· ὦ τάλαινα μᾶ-
in vain didst thou bring forth, it seems. I am angered with the gods; out upon them! O ye linked Graces, why are ye sending from his native land this poor youth, a guiltless sufferer,	τερ, ἔτεκες ἀνόνατα· φεῦ· μανίω θεοῖσιν· ἰὼ ἰώ· συζύγιαι Χάριτες, τί τὸν τάλαν’ ἐκ πατρίας γᾶς οὐδὲν ἄτας αἴτιον
far from his home?	πέμπετε τῶνδ’ ἀπ’ οἴκων;
But lo! I see a servant of Hippolytus hasting with troubled looks towards the palace.	— καὶ μὴν ὀπαδὸν Ἱππολύτου τόνδ’ εἰσορῶ σπουδῇ σκυθρωπὸν πρὸς δόμους ὁρμώμενον.
Ladies, where may I find Theseus, king of the country? pray, tell me if	ποῖ γῆς ἄνακτα τῆσδε Θησέα μολὼν εὕροιμ’ ἄν, ὦ γυναῖκες; εἴπερ ἴστε μοι
ye know; is he within the palace here?	σημήνατ’· ἆρα τῶνδε δωμάτων ἔσω;
Lo! himself approaches from the palace.	ὅδ’ αὐτὸς ἔξω δωμάτων πορεύεται.
Theseus, I am the bearer of troublous tidings to thee and all citizens who dwell in Athens or the bounds of Troezen.	Θησεῦ, μερίμνης ἄξιον φέρω λόγον σοὶ καὶ πολίταις οἵ τ’ Ἀθηναίων πόλιν ναίουσι καὶ γῆς τέρμονας Τροζηνίας.
How now? hath some strange calamity overtaken these two neighbouring cities?	τί δ’ ἔστι; μῶν τις συμφορὰ νεωτέρα δισσὰς κατείληφ’ ἀστυγείτονας πόλεις;
In one brief word, Hippolytus is dead. ’Tis true one slender thread still links him to the light of life.	Ἱππόλυτος οὐκέτ’ ἔστιν, ὡς εἰπεῖν ἔπος· δέδορκε μέντοι φῶς ἐπὶ σμικρᾶς ῥοπῆς.
Who slew him? Did some husband come to blows with him,	πρὸς τοῦ; δι’ ἔχθρας μῶν τις ἦν ἀφιγμένος,
one whose wife, like mine, had suffered brutal violence?	ὅτου κατῄσχυν’ ἄλοχον ὡς πατρὸς βίᾳ;
He perished through those steeds that drew his chariot, and through the curses thou didst utter, praying to thy sire, the ocean-king, to slay thy son.	οἰκεῖος αὐτὸν ὤλεσ’ ἁρμάτων ὄχος ἀραί τε τοῦ σοῦ στόματος, ἃς σὺ σῷ πατρὶ πόντου κρέοντι παιδὸς ἠράσω πέρι.
Ye gods and king Poseidon, thou hast proved my parentage	ὦ θεοὶ Πόσειδόν θ’, ὡς ἄρ’ ἦσθ’ ἐμὸς πατὴρ
by hearkening to my prayer! Say how he perished; how fell the uplifted hand of Justice to smite the villain who dishonoured me?	ὀρθῶς, ἀκούσας τῶν ἐμῶν κατευγμάτων. πῶς καὶ διώλετ’; εἰπέ· τῷ τρόπῳ Δίκης ἔπαισεν αὐτὸν ῥόπτρον αἰσχύναντ’ ἐμέ;
Hard by the wave-beat shore were we combing out his horses’ manes,	ἡμεῖς μὲν ἀκτῆς κυμοδέγμονος πέλας ψήκτραισιν ἵππων ἐκτενίζομεν τρίχας
weeping the while, for one had come to say that Hippolytus was harshly exiled by thee and nevermore would return to set foot in this land. Then came he, telling the same doleful tale to us upon the beach, and with him was a countless throng	κλαίοντες· ἦλθε γάρ τις ἄγγελος λέγων ὡς οὐκέτ’ ἐν γῇ τῇδ’ ἀναστρέψοι πόδα Ἱππόλυτος, ἐκ σοῦ τλήμονας φυγὰς ἔχων. ὃ δ’ ἦλθε ταὐτὸν δακρύων ἔχων μέλος ἡμῖν ἐπ’ ἀκτάς· μυρία δ’ ὀπισθόπους
of friends who followed after. At length he stayed his lamentation and spake: Why weakly rave on this wise? My father’s commands must be obeyed. Ho! servants, harness my horses to the chariot; this is no longer now city of mine.	φίλων ἅμ’ ἔστειχ’ ἡλίκων θ’ ὁμήγυρις. χρόνῳ δὲ δήποτ’ εἶπ’ ἀπαλλαχθεὶς γόων· Τί ταῦτ’ ἀλύω; πειστέον πατρὸς λόγοις. ἐντύναθ’ ἵππους ἅρμασι ζυγηφόρους, δμῶες· πόλις γὰρ οὐκέτ’ ἔστιν ἥδε μοι.
Thereupon each one of us bestirred himself, and, ere a man could say ’twas done, we had the horses standing ready at our master’s side. Then he caught up the reins from the chariot-rail, first fitting his feet exactly in the hollows made for them.	τοὐνθένδε μέντοι πᾶς ἀνὴρ ἠπείγετο, καὶ θᾶσσον ἢ λέγοι τις ἐξηρτυμένας πώλους παρ’ αὐτὸν δεσπότην ἐστήσαμεν. μάρπτει δὲ χερσὶν ἡνίας ἀπ’ ἄντυγος, αὐταῖσιν ἀρβύλαισιν ἁρμόσας πόδα.
But first with outspread palms he called upon the gods, O Zeus, now strike me dead, if I have sinned, and let my father learn how he is wronging me, in death at least, if not in life.	καὶ πρῶτα μὲν θεοῖς εἶπ’ ἀναπτύξας χέρας· Ζεῦ, μηκέτ’ εἴην, εἰ κακὸς πέφυκ’ ἀνήρ· αἴσθοιτο δ’ ἡμᾶς ὡς ἀτιμάζει πατὴρ ἤτοι θανόντας ἢ φάος δεδορκότας.
Therewith he seized the whip and lashed	κἀν τῷδ’ ἐπῆγε κέντρον ἐς χεῖρας λαβὼν
each horse in turn; while we, close by his chariot, near the reins, kept up with him along the road that leads direct to Argos and Epidaurus.	πώλοις ὁμαρτῇ· πρόσπολοι δ’ ὑφ’ ἅρματος πέλας χαλινῶν εἱπόμεσθα δεσπότῃ τὴν εὐθὺς Ἄργους κἀπιδαυρίας ὁδόν.
And just as we were coming to a desert spot, a strip of sand beyond the borders of this country,	ἐπεὶ δ’ ἔρημον χῶρον εἰσεβάλλομεν, ἀκτή τις ἔστι τοὐπέκεινα τῆσδε γῆς
sloping right to the Saronic gulf, there issued thence a deep rumbling sound, as it were an earthquake, a fearsome noise, and the horses reared their heads and pricked their ears, while we were filled with wild alarm	πρὸς πόντον ἤδη κειμένη Σαρωνικόν. ἔνθεν τις ἠχὼ χθόνιος ὡς βροντὴ Διὸς βαρὺν βρόμον μεθῆκε, φρικώδη κλύειν· ὀρθὸν δὲ κρᾶτ’ ἔστησαν οὖς τ’ ἐς οὐρανὸν ἵπποι· παρ’ ἡμῖν δ’ ἦν φόβος νεανικὸς
to know whence came  the sound; when, as we gazed toward the wave-beat shore, a wave tremendous we beheld towering to the skies, so that from our view the cliffs of Scirori vanished, for it hid the isthmus and the rock of Asclepius;	πόθεν ποτ’ εἴη φθόγγος. ἐς δ’ ἁλιρρόθους ἀκτὰς ἀποβλέψαντες ἱερὸν εἴδομεν κῦμ’ οὐρανῷ στηρίζον, ὥστ’ ἀφῃρέθη Σκίρωνος ἀκτὰς ὄμμα τοὐμὸν εἰσορᾶν· ἔκρυπτε δ’ Ἰσθμὸν καὶ πέτραν Ἀσκληπιοῦ.
then swelling and frothing with a crest of foam, the sea discharged it toward the beach where stood the harnessed car, and in the moment that it broke, that mighty wall of waters, there issued from the wave a monstrous bull,	κἄπειτ’ ἀνοιδῆσάν τε καὶ πέριξ ἀφρὸν πολὺν καχλάζον ποντίῳ φυσήματι χωρεῖ πρὸς ἀκτὰς οὗ τέθριππος ἦν ὄχος. αὐτῷ δὲ σὺν κλύδωνι καὶ τρικυμίᾳ κῦμ’ ἐξέθηκε ταῦρον, ἄγριον τέρας·
whose bellowing filled the land with fearsome echoes, a sight too awful as it seemed to us who witnessed it. A panic seized the horses there and then, but our master, to horses’ ways quite used,	οὗ πᾶσα μὲν χθὼν φθέγματος πληρουμένη φρικῶδες ἀντεφθέγγετ’, εἰσορῶσι δὲ κρεῖσσον θέαμα δεργμάτων ἐφαίνετο. εὐθὺς δὲ πώλοις δεινὸς ἐμπίπτει φόβος· καὶ δεσπότης μὲν ἱππικοῖσιν ἤθεσιν
gripped in both hands his reins, and tying them to his body pulled them backward as the sailor pulls his oar; but the horses gnashed the forged bits between their teeth and bore him wildly on, regardless of their master’s guiding hand	πολὺς ξυνοικῶν ἥρπασ’ ἡνίας χεροῖν, ἕλκει δὲ κώπην ὥστε ναυβάτης ἀνὴρ ἱμᾶσιν ἐς τοὔπισθεν ἀρτήσας δέμας· αἳ δ’ ἐνδακοῦσαι στόμια πυριγενῆ γναθμοῖς βίᾳ φέρουσιν, οὔτε ναυκλήρου χερὸς
or rein or jointed car. And oft as he would take the guiding rein and steer for softer ground, showed that bull in front to turn him back again, maddening his team with terror;	οὔθ’ ἱπποδέσμων οὔτε κολλητῶν ὄχων μεταστρέφουσαι. κεἰ μὲν ἐς τὰ μαλθακὰ γαίας ἔχων οἴακας εὐθύνοι δρόμον, προυφαίνετ’ ἐς τὸ πρόσθεν, ὥστ’ ἀναστρέφειν, ταῦρος, φόβῳ τέτρωρον ἐκμαίνων ὄχον·
but if in their frantic career they ran towards the rocks, he would draw nigh the chariot-rail, keeping up with them, until, suddenly dashing the wheel against a stone, he upset and wrecked the car; then was dire confusion,	εἰ δ’ ἐς πέτρας φέροιντο μαργῶσαι φρένας, σιγῇ πελάζων ἄντυγι ξυνείπετο ἐς τοῦθ’ ἕως ἔσφηλε κἀνεχαίτισεν, ἁψῖδα πέτρῳ προσβαλὼν ὀχήματος. σύμφυρτα δ’ ἦν ἅπαντα· σύριγγές τ’ ἄνω
axle-boxes and linchpins springing into the air. While he, poor youth, entangled in the reins was dragged along, bound by a stubborn knot, his poor head dashed against the rocks, his flesh all torn, the while he cried out piteously,	τροχῶν ἐπήδων ἀξόνων τ’ ἐνήλατα. αὐτὸς δ’ ὁ τλήμων ἡνίαισιν ἐμπλακεὶς δεσμὸν δυσεξήνυστον ἕλκεται δεθείς, σποδούμενος μὲν πρὸς πέτραις φίλον κάρα θραύων τε σάρκας, δεινὰ δ’ ἐξαυδῶν κλύειν·
Stay, stay, my horses whom my own hand hath fed at the manger, destroy me not utterly. O luckless curse of a father! Will no one come and save me for all my virtue?	Στῆτ’, ὦ φάτναισι ταῖς ἐμαῖς τεθραμμέναι, μή μ’ ἐξαλείψητ’· ὦ πατρὸς τάλαιν’ ἀρά. τίς ἄνδρ’ ἄριστον βούλεται σῶσαι παρών;
Now we, though much we longed to help, were left far behind. At last, I know not how, he broke loose	πολλοὶ δὲ βουληθέντες ὑστέρῳ ποδὶ ἐλειπόμεσθα. χὣ μὲν ἐκ δεσμῶν λυθεὶς
from the shapely reins that bound him, a faint breath of life still in him; but the horses disappeared, and that portentous bull, among the rocky ground, I know not where.	τμητῶν ἱμάντων οὐ κάτοιδ’ ὅτῳ τρόπῳ πίπτει, βραχὺν δὴ βίοτον ἐμπνέων ἔτι· ἵπποι δ’ ἔκρυφθεν καὶ τὸ δύστηνον τέρας ταύρου λεπαίας οὐ κάτοιδ’ ὅποι χθονός.
I am but a slave in thy house, ’tis true, O king,	δοῦλος μὲν οὖν ἔγωγε σῶν δόμων, ἄναξ,
yet will I never believe so monstrous a charge against thy son’s character, no! not though the whole race of womankind should hang itself, or one should fill with writing every pine-tree tablet grown on Ida, sure as I am of his uprightness.	ἀτὰρ τοσοῦτόν γ’ οὐ δυνήσομαί ποτε, τὸν σὸν πιθέσθαι παῖδ’ ὅπως ἐστὶν κακός· οὐδ’ εἰ γυναικῶν πᾶν κρεμασθείη γένος, καὶ τὴν ἐν Ἴδῃ γραμμάτων πλήσειέ τις πεύκην, ἐπεί νιν ἐσθλὸν ὄντ’ ἐπίσταμαι.
Alas! new troubles come to plague us, nor is there any escape from fate and necessity.	αἰαῖ· κέκρανται συμφορὰ νέων κακῶν, οὐδ’ ἔστι μοίρας τοῦ χρεών τ’ ἀπαλλαγή.
My hatred for him who hath thus suffered made me glad at thy tidings, yet from regard for the gods and him, because he is my son,	μίσει μὲν ἀνδρὸς τοῦ πεπονθότος τάδε λόγοισιν ἥσθην τοῖσδε· νῦν δ’ αἰδούμενος θεούς τ’ ἐκεῖνόν θ’, οὕνεκ’ ἐστὶν ἐξ ἐμοῦ,
I feel neither joy nor sorrow at his sufferings.	οὔθ’ ἥδομαι τοῖσδ’ οὔτ’ ἐπάχθομαι κακοῖς.
But say, are we to bring the victim hither, or how are we to fulfil thy wishes? Bethink thee; if by me thou wilt be schooled, thou wilt not harshly treat thy son in his sad plight.	πῶς οὖν; κομίζειν, ἢ τί χρὴ τὸν ἄθλιον δράσαντας ἡμᾶς σῇ χαρίζεσθαι φρενί; φρόντιζ’· ἐμοῖς δὲ χρώμενος βουλεύμασιν οὐκ ὠμὸς ἐς σὸν παῖδα δυστυχοῦντ’ ἔσῃ.
Bring him hither, that when I see him face to face, who hath denied having polluted my wife’s honour, I may by words and heaven’s visitation convict him.	κομίζετ’ αὐτόν, ὡς ἰδὼν ἐν ὄμμασιν τὸν τἄμ’ ἀπαρνηθέντα μὴ χρᾶναι λέχη λόγοις τ’ ἐλέγξω δαιμόνων τε συμφοραῖς.
Ah! Cypris, thine the hand that guides the stubborn hearts of gods and men; thine,	σὺ τὰν θεῶν ἄκαμπτον φρένα καὶ βροτῶν ἄγεις, Κύπρι, σὺν δ’
and that attendant boy’s, who, with painted plumage gay, flutters round his victims on lightning wing. O’er the land and booming deep on golden pinion borne flits the god of Love,	ὁ ποικιλόπτερος ἀμφιβαλὼν ὠκυτάτῳ πτερῷ. ποτᾶται δὲ γαῖαν εὐάχητόν θ’ ἁλμυρὸν ἐπὶ πόντον. θέλγει δ’ Ἔρως, ᾧ μαινομένᾳ κραδίᾳ
maddening the heart and beguiling the senses of all whom he attacks, savage whelps on mountains bred, ocean’s monsters, creatures of this sun-warmed earth,	πτανὸς ἐφορμάσῃ χρυσοφαής, φύσιν ὀρεσκόων σκυλάκων πελαγίων θ’ ὅσα τε γᾶ τρέφει τά τ’ ἀέλιος αἰθόμενα δέρκεται,
and man; thine, O Cypris, thine alone the sovereign power to rule them all.	ἄνδρας τε· συμπάντων βασιληίδα τιμάν, Κύπρι, τῶνδε μόνα κρατύνεις.
Hearken, I bid thee, noble son of Aegeus:	σὲ τὸν εὐπατρίδην Αἰγέως κέλομαι παῖδ’ ἐπακοῦσαι·
lo! ’tis I Latona’s child, that speak, I, Artemis. Why, Theseus, to thy sorrow dost thou rejoice at these tidings, seeing that thou hast slain thy son most impiously, listening to a charge not clearly proved, but falsely sworn to by thy wife? though clearly has the curse therefrom upon thee fallen.	Λητοῦς δὲ κόρη σ’ Ἄρτεμις αὐδῶ. Θησεῦ, τί τάλας τοῖσδε συνήδῃ, παῖδ’ οὐχ ὁσίως σὸν ἀποκτείνας, ψευδέσι μύθοις ἀλόχου πεισθεὶς ἀφανῆ; φανερὰν δ’ ἔσχεθες ἄτην.
Why dost thou not for very shame hide beneath the dark places of the earth, or change thy human life and soar on wings to escape this tribulation? ’Mongst men of honour thou hast 	πῶς οὐχ ὑπὸ γῆς τάρταρα κρύπτεις δέμας αἰσχυνθείς, ἢ πτηνὸς ἄνω μεταβὰς βίοτον πήματος ἔξω πόδα τοῦδ’ ἀνέχεις; ὡς ἔν γ’ ἀγαθοῖς ἀνδράσιν οὔ σοι
now no share in life.	κτητὸν βιότου μέρος ἐστίν.
Hearken, Theseus; I will put thy wretched case. Yet will it naught avail thee, if I do, but vex thy heart; still with this intent I came, to show thy son’s pure heart,—that he may die with honour,—	ἄκουε, Θησεῦ, σῶν κακῶν κατάστασιν· καίτοι προκόψω γ’ οὐδέν, ἀλγυνῶ δέ σε. ἀλλ’ ἐς τόδ’ ἦλθον, παιδὸς ἐκδεῖξαι φρένα τοῦ σοῦ δικαίαν, ὡς ὑπ’ εὐκλείας θάνῃ,
as well the frenzy, and, in a sense, the nobleness of thy wife; for she was cruelly stung with a passion for thy son by that goddess whom all we, that joy in virgin purity, detest. And though she strove to conquer love by resolution,	καὶ σῆς γυναικὸς οἶστρον ἢ τρόπον τινὰ γενναιότητα· τῆς γὰρ ἐχθίστης θεῶν ἡμῖν, ὅσαισι παρθένειος ἡδονή, δηχθεῖσα κέντροις παιδὸς ἠράσθη σέθεν. γνώμῃ δὲ νικᾶν τὴν Κύπριν πειρωμένη
yet by no fault of hers she fell, thanks to her nurse’s strategy, who did reveal her malady unto thy son under oath. But he would none of her counsels, as indeed was right, nor yet, when thou didst revile him, would he break the oath he swore, from piety.	τροφοῦ διώλετ’ οὐχ ἑκοῦσα μηχαναῖς, ἣ σῷ δι’ ὅρκων παιδὶ σημαίνει νόσον. ὃ δ’, ὥσπερ ὢν δίκαιος, οὐκ ἐφέσπετο λόγοισιν, οὐδ’ αὖ πρὸς σέθεν κακούμενος ὅρκων ἀφεῖλε πίστιν, εὐσεβὴς γεγώς.
She meantime, fearful of being found out, wrote a lying letter, destroying by guile thy son, but yet persuading thee.	ἣ δ’ εἰς ἔλεγχον μὴ πέσῃ φοβουμένη ψευδεῖς γραφὰς ἔγραψε καὶ διώλεσεν δόλοισι σὸν παῖδ’· ἀλλ’ ὅμως ἔπεισέ σε.
Woe is me!	οἴμοι.
Doth my story wound thee, Theseus? Be still awhile; hear what follows, so wilt thou have more cause to groan.	δάκνει σε, Θησεῦ, μῦθος; ἀλλ’ ἔχ’ ἥσυχος, τοὐνθένδ’ ἀκούσας ὡς ἂν οἰμώξῃς πλέον.
Dost remember those three prayers thy father granted thee, fraught with certain issue? ’Tis one of these thou hast misused, unnatural wretch, against thy son, instead of aiming it at an enemy. Thy sea-god sire, ’tis true, for all his kind intent, hath granted that boon he was compelled, by reason of his promise, to grant.	ἆρ’ οἶσθα πατρὸς τρεῖς ἀρὰς ἔχων σαφεῖς; ὧν τὴν μίαν παρεῖλες, ὦ κάκιστε σύ, ἐς παῖδα τὸν σόν, ἐξὸν εἰς ἐχθρόν τινα. πατὴρ μὲν οὖν σοι πόντιος φρονῶν καλῶς ἔδωχ’ ὅσονπερ χρῆν, ἐπείπερ ᾔνεσεν·
But thou alike in his eyes and in mine hast shewn thy evil heart, in that thou hast forestalled all proof or voice prophetic, hast made no inquiry, nor taken time for consideration, but with undue haste cursed thy son even to the death.	σὺ δ’ ἔν τ’ ἐκείνῳ κἀν ἐμοὶ φαίνῃ κακός, ὃς οὔτε πίστιν οὔτε μάντεων ὄπα ἔμεινας, οὐκ ἤλεγξας, οὐ χρόνῳ μακρῷ σκέψιν παρέσχες, ἀλλὰ θᾶσσον ἤ σ’ ἐχρῆν ἀρὰς ἀφῆκας παιδὶ καὶ κατέκτανες.
Perdition seize me! Queen revered!	δέσποιν’, ὀλοίμην.
An awful deed was thine, but still even for this thou mayest obtain pardon; for it was Cypris that would have it so, sating the fury of her soul. For this is law amongst us gods; none of us will thwart	δείν’ ἔπραξας, ἀλλ’ ὅμως ἔτ’ ἔστι καί σοι τῶνδε συγγνώμης τυχεῖν· Κύπρις γὰρ ἤθελ’ ὥστε γίγνεσθαι τόδε, πληροῦσα θυμόν. θεοῖσι δ’ ὧδ’ ἔχει νόμος· οὐδεὶς ἀπαντᾶν βούλεται προθυμίᾳ
his neighbour’s will, but ever we stand aloof. For be well assured, did I not fear Zeus, never would I have incurred the bitter shame of handing over to death a man of all his kind to me most dear. As for thy sin,	τῇ τοῦ θέλοντος, ἀλλ’ ἀφιστάμεσθ’ ἀεί. ἐπεί, σάφ’ ἴσθι, Ζῆνα μὴ φοβουμένη οὐκ ἄν ποτ’ ἦλθον ἐς τόδ’ αἰσχύνης ἐγὼ ὥστ’ ἄνδρα πάντων φίλτατον βροτῶν ἐμοὶ θανεῖν ἐᾶσαι. τὴν δὲ σὴν ἁμαρτίαν
first thy ignorance absolves thee from its villainy, next thy wife, who is dead, was lavish in her use of convincing arguments to influence thy mind.	τὸ μὴ εἰδέναι μὲν πρῶτον ἐκλύει κάκης· ἔπειτα δ’ ἡ θανοῦσ’ ἀνήλωσεν γυνὴ λόγων ἐλέγχους ὥστε σὴν πεῖσαι φρένα.
On thee in chief this storm of woe hath burst, yet is it some grief to me as well; for when the righteous die, there is no joy in heaven,	μάλιστα μέν νυν σοὶ τάδ’ ἔρρωγεν κακά, λύπη δὲ κἀμοί· τοὺς γὰρ εὐσεβεῖς θεοὶ
albeit we try to destroy the wicked, house and home.	θνῄσκοντας οὐ χαίρουσι· τούς γε μὴν κακοὺς αὐτοῖς τέκνοισι καὶ δόμοις ἐξόλλυμεν.
Lo! where he comes, this hapless youth, his fair young flesh and auburn locks most shamefully handled. Unhappy house!	καὶ μὴν ὁ τάλας ὅδε δὴ στείχει, σάρκας νεαρὰς ξανθόν τε κάρα διαλυμανθείς. ὦ πόνος οἴκων,
what twofold sorrow doth o’ertake its halls, through heaven’s ordinance!	οἷον ἐκράνθη δίδυμον μελάθροις πένθος θεόθεν καταληπτόν.
Ah! ah! woe is me! foully undone by an impious father’s impious imprecation!	αἰαῖ αἰαῖ· δύστηνος ἐγώ, πατρὸς ἐξ ἀδίκου χρησμοῖς ἀδίκοις διελυμάνθην.
Undone, undone! woe is me! Through my head shoot fearful pains; my brain throbs convulsively. Stop, let me rest my worn-out frame.Oh, oh!	ἀπόλωλα τάλας, οἴμοι μοι. διά μου κεφαλῆς ᾄσσουσ’ ὀδύναι, κατὰ δ’ ἐγκέφαλον πηδᾷ σφάκελος. σχές, ἀπειρηκὸς σῶμ’ ἀναπαύσω.
Accursed steeds, that mine own hand did feed, ye have been my ruin and my death. O by the gods, good sirs, I beseech ye, softly touch my wounded limbs.	ὦ στυγνὸν ὄχημ’ ἵππειον, ἐμῆς βόσκημα χερός, διά μ’ ἔφθειρας, κατὰ δ’ ἔκτεινας. φεῦ φεῦ· πρὸς θεῶν, ἀτρέμας, δμῶες, χροὸς ἑλκώδους ἅπτεσθε χεροῖν.
Who stands there at my right side? Lift me tenderly; with slow and even step conduct a poor wretch cursed by his mistaken sire. Great Zeus, dost thou see this? Me thy reverent worshipper,	τίς ἐφέστηκεν δεξιὰ πλευροῖς; πρόσφορά μ’ αἴρετε, σύντονα δ’ ἕλκετε τὸν κακοδαίμονα καὶ κατάρατον πατρὸς ἀμπλακίαις. Ζεῦ Ζεῦ, τάδ’ ὁρᾷς; ὅδ’ ὁ σεμνὸς ἐγὼ καὶ θεοσέπτωρ,
me who left all men behind in purity, plunged thus into yawning Hades ’neath the earth, reft of life; in vain the toils I have endured through my piety towards mankind.	ὅδ’ ὁ σωφροσύνῃ πάντας ὑπερσχὼν προῦπτον ἐς Ἅιδην στείχω κατ’ ἄκρας ὀλέσας βίοτον· μόχθους δ’ ἄλλως τῆς εὐσεβίας εἰς ἀνθρώπους ἐπόνησα.
Ah me! ah me! O the thrill of anguish shooting through me! Set me down, poor wretch I am; come Death to set me free! Kill me, end my sufferings.	αἰαῖ αἰαῖ· καὶ νῦν ὀδύνα μ’ ὀδύνα βαίνει — μέθετέ με, τάλανες — καί μοι θάνατος Παιὰν ἔλθοι. προσαπόλλυτ’ ἀπόλλυτε τὸν δυσδαί-
O for a sword two-edged to hack my flesh, and close this mortal life! Ill-fated curse of my father! the crimes of bloody kinsmen. ancestors of old,	μονά μ’· ἀμφιτόμου λόγχας ἔραμαι, διαμοιρᾶσαι διά τ’ εὐνᾶσαι τὸν ἐμὸν βίοτον. ὦ πατρὸς ἐμοῦ δύστηνος ἀρά· μιαιφόνων συγγόνων παλαιῶν
now pass their boundaries and tarry not, and upon me are they come all guiltless as I am; ah! why? Alas, alas!	προγεννητόρων ἐξορίζεται κακόν, οὐδὲ μέλλει, ἔμολέ τ’ ἐπ’ ἐμὲ τί ποτε τὸν οὐ- δὲν ὄντ’ ἐπαίτιον κακῶν; ἰώ μοί μοι·
what can I say? How from my life  get rid of this relentless agony? O that the stern Death-god, night’s black visitant, would give my sufferings rest!	— τί φῶ; πῶς ἀπαλλάξω βιοτὰν ἐμὰν τάνδ’ ἀναλ- γήτου πάθους; εἴθε με κοι- μάσειε τὸν δυσδαίμον’ Ἅι- δου μέλαινα νύκτερός τ’ ἀνάγκα.
Poor sufferer! cruel the fate that links thee to it!	ὦ τλῆμον, οἵᾳ συμφορᾷ συνεζύγης·
Thy noble soul hath been thy ruin.	τὸ δ’ εὐγενές σε τῶν φρενῶν ἀπώλεσεν.
Ah! the fragrance from my goddess wafted! Even in my agony I feel thee near and find relief; she is here in this very place, my goddess Artemis.	ἔα· ὦ θεῖον ὀδμῆς πνεῦμα· καὶ γὰρ ἐν κακοῖς ὢν ᾐσθόμην σου κἀνεκουφίσθην δέμας· ἔστ’ ἐν τόποισι τοισίδ’ Ἄρτεμις θεά.
She is, poor sufferer! the goddess thou hast loved the best.	ὦ τλῆμον, ἔστι, σοί γε φιλτάτη θεῶν.
Dost see me, mistress mine? dost see my present suffering?	ὁρᾷς με, δέσποιν’, ὡς ἔχω, τὸν ἄθλιον;
I see thee, but mine eyes no tear may weep.	ὁρῶ· κατ’ ὄσσων δ’ οὐ θέμις βαλεῖν δάκρυ.
Thou hast none now to lead the hunt or tend thy fane.	οὐκ ἔστι σοι κυναγὸς οὐδ’ ὑπηρέτης,
None now; yet e’en in death I love thee still.	οὐ δῆτ’· ἀτάρ μοι προσφιλής γ’ ἀπόλλυσαι.
None to groom thy steeds, or guard thy shrines.	οὐδ’ ἱππονώμας οὐδ’ ἀγαλμάτων φύλαξ.
Twas Cypris, mistress of iniquity, devised this evil.	Κύπρις γὰρ ἡ πανοῦργος ὧδ’ ἐμήσατο.
Ah me! now know I the goddess who destroyed me.	ὤμοι· φρονῶ δὴ δαίμον’ ἥ μ’ ἀπώλεσεν.
She was jealous of her slighted honour, vexed at thy chaste life.	τιμῆς ἐμέμφθη σωφρονοῦντι δ’ ἤχθετο.
Ah! then I see her single hand hath struck down three of us.	τρεῖς ὄντας ἡμᾶς ὤλεσ’, ᾔσθημαι, Κύπρις.
Thy sire and thee, and last thy father’s wife.	πατέρα γε καὶ σὲ καὶ τρίτην ξυνάορον.
My sire’s ill-luck as well as mine I mourn.	ᾤμωξα τοίνυν καὶ πατρὸς δυσπραξίας.
He was deceived by a goddess’s design.	ἐξηπατήθη δαίμονος βουλεύμασιν.
Woe is thee, my father, in this sad mischance!	ὦ δυστάλας σὺ τῆσδε συμφορᾶς, πάτερ.
My son, I am a ruined man; life has no joys for me.	ὄλωλα, τέκνον, οὐδέ μοι χάρις βίου.
For this mistake I mourn thee rather than myself.	στένω σὲ μᾶλλον ἢ ’μὲ τῆς ἁμαρτίας.
O that I had died for thee, my son!	εἰ γὰρ γενοίμην, τέκνον, ἀντὶ σοῦ νεκρός.
Ah! those fatal gifts thy sire Poseidon gave.	ὦ δῶρα πατρὸς σοῦ Ποσειδῶνος πικρά.
Would God these lips had never uttered that prayer!	ὡς μήποτ’ ἐλθεῖν ὤφελ’ ἐς τοὐμὸν στόμα.
Why not? thou wouldst in any case have slain me in thy fury then.	τί δ’; ἔκτανές τἄν μ’, ὡς τότ’ ἦσθ’ ὠργισμένος.
Yes; Heaven had perverted my power to think.	δόξης γὰρ ἦμεν πρὸς θεῶν ἐσφαλμένοι.
O that the race of men could bring a curse upon the gods!	φεῦ· εἴθ’ ἦν ἀραῖον δαίμοσιν βροτῶν γένος.
Enough! for though thou pass to gloom beneath the earth, the wrath of Cypris shall not, at her will, fall on thee unrequited, because thou hadst a noble righteous soul.	ἔασον· οὐ γὰρ οὐδὲ γῆς ὑπὸ ζόφον θεᾶς ἄτιμοι Κύπριδος ἐκ προθυμίας ὀργαὶ κατασκήψουσιν ἐς τὸ σὸν δέμας σῆς εὐσεβείας κἀγαθῆς φρενὸς χάριν.
For I with mine own hand will with these unerring shafts avenge me on another, who is her votary, dearest to her of all the sons of men. And to thee, poor sufferer, for thy anguish now will I grant high honours in the city of Troezen;	ἐγὼ γὰρ αὐτῆς ἄλλον ἐξ ἐμῆς χερὸς ὃς ἂν μάλιστα φίλτατος κυρῇ βροτῶν τόξοις ἀφύκτοις τοῖσδε τιμωρήσομαι. σοὶ δ’, ὦ ταλαίπωρ’, ἀντὶ τῶνδε τῶν κακῶν τιμὰς μεγίστας ἐν πόλει Τροζηνίᾳ
for thee shall maids unwed before their marriage cut off their hair, thy harvest through the long roll of time of countless bitter tears. Yea, and for ever shall the virgin choir hymn thy sad memory,	δώσω· κόραι γὰρ ἄζυγες γάμων πάρος κόμας κεροῦνταί σοι, δι’ αἰῶνος μακροῦ πένθη μέγιστα δακρύων καρπουμένῳ. ἀεὶ δὲ μουσοποιὸς ἐς σὲ παρθένων ἔσται μέριμνα, κοὐκ ἀνώνυμος πεσὼν
nor shall Phaedra’s love for thee fall into oblivion and pass away unnoticed.	ἔρως ὁ Φαίδρας ἐς σὲ σιγηθήσεται.
But thou, O son of old Aegeus, take thy son in thine arms, draw him close to thee, for unwittingly thou slewest him, and men may well commit an error when gods put it in their way.	σὺ δ’, ὦ γεραιοῦ τέκνον Αἰγέως, λαβὲ σὸν παῖδ’ ἐν ἀγκάλαισι καὶ προσέλκυσαι· ἄκων γὰρ ὤλεσάς νιν· ἀνθρώποισι δὲ θεῶν διδόντων εἰκὸς ἐξαμαρτάνειν.
And thee Hippolytus, I admonish; hate not thy sire, for in this death thou dost but meet thy destined fate.	καὶ σοὶ παραινῶ πατέρα μὴ στυγεῖν σέθεν, Ἱππόλυτ’· ἔχεις γὰρ μοῖραν ᾗ διεφθάρης.
And now farewell! ’tis not for me to gaze upon the dead, or pollute my sight with death-scenes, and e’en now I see thee nigh that evil moment.	καὶ χαῖρ’· ἐμοὶ γὰρ οὐ θέμις φθιτοὺς ὁρᾶν οὐδ’ ὄμμα χραίνειν θανασίμοισιν ἐκπνοαῖς· ὁρῶ δέ σ’ ἤδη τοῦδε πλησίον κακοῦ.
Farewell, blest virgin queen! leave me now! How easily thou resignest our long friendship! I am reconciled with my father at thy desire, yea, for ever before I would obey thy bidding.	χαίρουσα καὶ σὺ στεῖχε, παρθέν’ ὀλβία· μακρὰν δὲ λείπεις ῥᾳδίως ὁμιλίαν. λύω δὲ νεῖκος πατρὶ χρῃζούσης σέθεν· καὶ γὰρ πάροιθε σοῖς ἐπειθόμην λόγοις.
Ah me! the darkness is settling even now upon my eyes.	αἰαῖ, κατ’ ὄσσων κιγχάνει μ’ ἤδη σκότος·
Take me, father, in thy arms, lift me up.	λαβοῦ, πάτερ, μου καὶ κατόρθωσον δέμας.
Woe is me, my son! what art thou doing to me thy hapless sire!	οἴμοι, τέκνον, τί δρᾷς με τὸν δυσδαίμονα;
I am a broken man; yes, I see the gates that close upon the dead.	ὄλωλα καὶ δὴ νερτέρων ὁρῶ πύλας.
Canst leave me thus with murder on my soul!	ἦ τὴν ἐμὴν ἄναγνον ἐκλιπὼν χέρα;
No, no; I set thee free from this bloodguiltiness.	οὐ δῆτ’, ἐπεί σε τοῦδ’ ἐλευθερῶ φόνου.
What sayest thou? dost absolve me from bloodshed?	τί φῄς; ἀφίης αἵματός μ’ ἐλεύθερον;
Artemis, the archer-queen, is my witness that I do.	τὴν τοξόδαμνον Ἄρτεμιν μαρτύρομαι.
My own dear child, how generous dost thou show thyself to thy father!	ὦ φίλταθ’, ὡς γενναῖος ἐκφαίνῃ πατρί.
Pray to have children such as me bom in lawful wedlock.	τοιῶνδε παίδων γνησίων εὔχου τυχεῖν.
O that holy, noble soul of thine!	οἴμοι φρενὸς σῆς εὐσεβοῦς τε κἀγαθῆς.
Farewell, dear father! a long farewell to thee!	ὦ χαῖρε καὶ σύ, χαῖρε πολλά μοι, πάτερ.
O leave me not, my son; endure awhile.	μή νυν προδῷς με, τέκνον, ἀλλὰ καρτέρει.
’Tis finished, my endurance; I die, father; quickly cover my face with a mantle.	κεκαρτέρηται τἄμ’· ὄλωλα γάρ, πάτερ. κρύψον δέ μου πρόσωπον ὡς τάχος πέπλοις.
O glorious Athens, realm of Pallas,	ὦ κλείν’ Ἀθῆναι Παλλάδος θ’ ὁρίσματα,
what a splendid hero ye have lost! Ah me, ah me! How oft shall I remember thy evil work, O Cypris!	οἵου στερήσεσθ’ ἀνδρός. ὦ τλήμων ἐγώ· ὡς πολλά, Κύπρι, σῶν κακῶν μεμνήσομαι.
On all our citizens hath come this universal sorrow, unforeseen. Now shall the copious tear gush forth,	κοινὸν τόδ’ ἄχος πᾶσι πολίταις ἦλθεν ἀέλπτως. πολλῶν δακρύων ἔσται πίτυλος·
for sad news about great men takes more than usual hold upon the heart.	τῶν γὰρ μεγάλων ἀξιοπενθεῖς φῆμαι μᾶλλον κατέχουσιν.
My children, latest-born wards of old Cadmus, why do you sit before me like this with wreathed branches of suppliants, while the city reeks with incense,	ὦ τέκνα, Κάδμου τοῦ πάλαι νέα τροφή, τίνας ποθʼ ἕδρας τάσδε μοι θοάζετε ἱκτηρίοις κλάδοισιν ἐξεστεμμένοι; πόλις δʼ ὁμοῦ μὲν θυμιαμάτων γέμει,
rings with prayers for health and cries of woe? I thought it unbefitting, my children, to hear these things from the mouths of others, and have come here myself, I, Oedipus renowned by all. Tell me, then, venerable old man—since it is proper that you	ὁμοῦ δὲ παιάνων τε καὶ στεναγμάτων· ἁγὼ δικαιῶν μὴ παρʼ ἀγγέλων, τέκνα, ἄλλων ἀκούειν αὐτὸς ὧδʼ ἐλήλυθα, ὁ πᾶσι κλεινὸς Οἰδίπους καλούμενος. ἀλλʼ ὦ γεραιέ, φράζʼ, ἐπεὶ πρέπων ἔφυς
speak for these—in what mood you sit here, one of fear or of desire? Be sure that I will gladly give you all my help. I would be hard-hearted indeed if I did not pity such suppliants as these.	πρὸ τῶνδε φωνεῖν, τίνι τρόπῳ καθέστατε, δείσαντες ἢ στέρξαντες; ὡς θέλοντος ἂν ἐμοῦ προσαρκεῖν πᾶν· δυσάλγητος γὰρ ἂν εἴην τοιάνδε μὴ οὐ κατοικτίρων ἕδραν.
Oedipus, ruler of my land, you see the age of those who sit	ἀλλʼ ὦ κρατύνων Οἰδίπους χώρας ἐμῆς,
on your altars—some, nestlings still too tender for flight, others, bowed with age, priests, like me of Zeus, and some, these here, the chosen youth. The rest of the folk sit	ὁρᾷς μὲν ἡμᾶς ἡλίκοι προσήμεθα βωμοῖσι τοῖς σοῖς· οἱ μὲν οὐδέπω μακρὰν πτέσθαι σθένοντες, οἱ δὲ σὺν γήρᾳ βαρεῖς, ἱερῆς, ἐγὼ μὲν Ζηνός, οἵδε τʼ ᾐθέων λεκτοί· τὸ δʼ ἄλλο φῦλον ἐξεστεμμένον
with wreathed branches in the market-place, and before the shrines of Pallas, and where Ismenus gives answer by fire. For the city, as you yourself see, is now sorely vexed, and can no longer lift her head from beneath the angry waves of death.	ἀγοραῖσι θακεῖ πρός τε Παλλάδος διπλοῖς ναοῖς, ἐπʼ Ἰσμηνοῦ τε μαντείᾳ σποδῷ. πόλις γάρ, ὥσπερ καὐτὸς εἰσορᾷς, ἄγαν ἤδη σαλεύει κἀνακουφίσαι κάρα βυθῶν ἔτʼ οὐχ οἵα τε φοινίου σάλου,
A blight has fallen on the fruitful blossoms of the land, the herds among the pastures, the barren pangs of women. And the flaming god, the malign plague, has swooped upon us, and ravages the town: he lays waste to the house of Cadmus, but enriches Hades with	φθίνουσα μὲν κάλυξιν ἐγκάρποις χθονός, φθίνουσα δʼ ἀγέλαις βουνόμοις τόκοισί τε ἀγόνοις γυναικῶν· ἐν δʼ ὁ πυρφόρος θεὸς σκήψας ἐλαύνει, λοιμὸς ἔχθιστος, πόλιν, ὑφʼ οὗ κενοῦται δῶμα Καδμεῖον, μέλας δʼ
groans and tears. It is not because we rank you with the gods that I and these children are suppliants at your hearth, but because we deem you the first among men in life’s common fortunes and in dealings with the divinities:	Ἅιδης στεναγμοῖς καὶ γόοις πλουτίζεται. θεοῖσι μέν νυν οὐκ ἰσούμενόν σʼ ἐγὼ οὐδʼ οἵδε παῖδες ἑζόμεσθʼ ἐφέστιοι, ἀνδρῶν δὲ πρῶτον ἔν τε συμφοραῖς βίου κρίνοντες ἔν τε δαιμόνων συναλλαγαῖς·
when you came to the city of the Cadmeans, you freed us from the tax that we rendered to the hard songstress, and that when you knew no more than anyone else, nor had you been taught, but rather by the assistance of a god, as the story goes, you uplifted our life.	ὅς γʼ ἐξέλυσας ἄστυ Καδμεῖον μολὼν σκληρᾶς ἀοιδοῦ δασμὸν ὃν παρείχομεν, καὶ ταῦθʼ ὑφʼ ἡμῶν οὐδὲν ἐξειδὼς πλέον οὐδʼ ἐκδιδαχθείς, ἀλλὰ προσθήκῃ θεοῦ λέγει νομίζει θʼ ἡμὶν ὀρθῶσαι βίον·
Now, Oedipus, king glorious in our eyes, we, your suppliants, beseech you to find some defence for us, whether you hear it from some divine omen, or learn of it from some mortal. For I see that the outcome of the councils of experienced men	νῦν τʼ, ὦ κράτιστον πᾶσιν Οἰδίπου κάρα, ἱκετεύομέν σε πάντες οἵδε πρόστροποι ἀλκήν τινʼ εὑρεῖν ἡμίν, εἴτε του θεῶν φήμην ἀκούσας εἴτʼ ἀπʼ ἀνδρὸς οἶσθά του· ὡς τοῖσιν ἐμπείροισι καὶ τὰς ξυμφορὰς
most often have effect. On, best of mortals, uplift our state! On, guard your fame, since now this land calls you savior on account of your former zeal. Let us not remember of your reign that	ζώσας ὁρῶ μάλιστα τῶν βουλευμάτων. ἴθʼ, ὦ βροτῶν ἄριστʼ, ἀνόρθωσον πόλιν, ἴθʼ, εὐλαβήθηθʼ· ὡς σὲ νῦν μὲν ἥδε γῆ σωτῆρα κλῄζει τῆς πάρος προθυμίας· ἀρχῆς δὲ τῆς σῆς μηδαμῶς μεμνώμεθα
we were first restored and then cast down: lift this state so that it falls no more! With good omen you provided us that past happiness: show yourself the same now too, since if you are to rule this land just as you do now, it is better to be lord of men than of a wasteland.	στάντες τʼ ἐς ὀρθὸν καὶ πεσόντες ὕστερον. ἀλλʼ ἀσφαλείᾳ τήνδʼ ἀνόρθωσον πόλιν· ὄρνιθι γὰρ καὶ τὴν τότʼ αἰσίῳ τύχην παρέσχες ἡμῖν, καὶ τανῦν ἴσος γενοῦ. ὡς εἴπερ ἄρξεις τῆσδε γῆς, ὥσπερ κρατεῖς,
Neither walled town nor ship is anything, if it is empty and no men dwell within.	ξὺν ἀνδράσιν κάλλιον ἢ κενῆς κρατεῖν· ὡς οὐδέν ἐστιν οὔτε πύργος οὔτε ναῦς ἔρημος ἀνδρῶν μὴ ξυνοικούντων ἔσω.
My piteous children, I know quite well the desires with which you have come: I know well that	ὦ παῖδες οἰκτροί, γνωτὰ κοὐκ ἄγνωτά μοι προσήλθεθʼ ἱμείροντες· εὖ γὰρ οἶδʼ ὅτι
you all are sick, and though you are sick I know well that there is not one of you who is as sick as I. Your pain comes on each of you for himself alone, and for no other, but my soul is in pain at once for the city, for myself, and for you.	νοσεῖτε πάντες, καὶ νοσοῦντες, ὡς ἐγὼ οὐκ ἔστιν ὑμῶν ὅστις ἐξ ἴσου νοσεῖ. τὸ μὲν γὰρ ὑμῶν ἄλγος εἰς ἕνʼ ἔρχεται μόνον καθʼ αὑτὸν κοὐδένʼ ἄλλον, ἡ δʼ ἐμὴ ψυχὴ πόλιν τε κἀμὲ καὶ σʼ ὁμοῦ στένει.
Thus you are not awakening me from sleep: no, be sure that I have wept many tears, wandered far and wide in my thought. I have made use of the only remedy which I could find after close consideration: I sent my relative	ὥστʼ οὐχ ὕπνῳ γʼ εὕδοντά μʼ ἐξεγείρετε, ἀλλʼ ἴστε πολλὰ μέν με δακρύσαντα δή, πολλὰς δʼ ὁδοὺς ἐλθόντα φροντίδος πλάνοις· ἣν δʼ εὖ σκοπῶν ηὕρισκον ἴασιν μόνην, ταύτην ἔπραξα· παῖδα γὰρ Μενοικέως
Creon, Menoeceus’ son, to Apollo’s Pythian residence to learn what we might do or say to protect this city. And now, when the lapse of days is reckoned, I am troubled about what he is doing, for he has been away an unreasonably long time	Κρέοντʼ, ἐμαυτοῦ γαμβρόν, ἐς τὰ Πυθικὰ ἔπεμψα Φοίβου δώμαθʼ, ὡς πύθοιθʼ ὅ τι δρῶν ἢ τί φωνῶν τήνδε ῥυσαίμην πόλιν. καί μʼ ἦμαρ ἤδη ξυμμετρούμενον χρόνῳ λυπεῖ τί πράσσει· τοῦ γὰρ εἰκότος πέρα
beyond what is fitting. But when he arrives, I would be no true man if did not perform all that the god reveals.	ἄπεστι πλείω τοῦ καθήκοντος χρόνου. ὅταν δʼ ἵκηται, τηνικαῦτʼ ἐγὼ κακὸς μὴ δρῶν ἂν εἴην πάνθʼ ὅσʼ ἂν δηλοῖ θεός.
You have spoken opportunely, since at this time these people here indicate that Creon is drawing near.	ἀλλʼ εἰς καλὸν σύ τʼ εἶπας οἵδε τʼ ἀρτίως Κρέοντα προσστείχοντα σημαίνουσί μοι.
Lord Apollo, may he come to us in the brightness of saving fortune, even as his face is bright!	ὦναξ Ἄπολλον, εἰ γὰρ ἐν τύχῃ γέ τῳ σωτῆρι βαίη λαμπρὸς ὥσπερ ὄμματι
He seems to bring comfort, since otherwise he would not be coming crowned so thickly with berry-laden bay.	ἀλλʼ εἰκάσαι μέν, ἡδύς· οὐ γὰρ ἂν κάρα πολυστεφὴς ὧδʼ εἷρπε παγκάρπου δάφνης.
We will soon know: he is within hearing-range.	τάχʼ εἰσόμεσθα· ξύμμετρος γὰρ ὡς κλύειν.
Prince, my kinsman, child of Menoeceus, what news have you brought us from the god?	ἄναξ, ἐμὸν κήδευμα, παῖ Μενοικέως, τίνʼ ἡμὶν ἥκεις τοῦ θεοῦ φήμην φέρων;
Good news. I tell you that even troubles hard to bear will end in perfect peace if they find the right issue.	ἐσθλήν· λέγω γὰρ καὶ τὰ δύσφορʼ, εἰ τύχοι κατʼ ὀρθὸν ἐξελθόντα, πάντʼ ἂν εὐτυχεῖν.
But what is the oracle ? So far, your words	ἔστιν δὲ ποῖον τοὔπος; οὔτε γὰρ θρασὺς
neither encourage nor frighten me.	οὔτʼ οὖν προδείσας εἰμὶ τῷ γε νῦν λόγῳ.
If you want to hear in the presence of these people, I am ready to speak: otherwise we can go inside.	εἰ τῶνδε χρῄζεις πλησιαζόντων κλύειν, ἕτοιμος εἰπεῖν, εἴτε καὶ στείχειν ἔσω.
Speak to all. The sorrow that I bear for these is more than for my own life.	ἐς πάντας αὔδα· τῶνδε γὰρ πλέον φέρω τὸ πένθος ἢ καὶ τῆς ἐμῆς ψυχῆς πέρι.
I will tell you what I heard from the god. Phoebus our lord clearly commands us to drive out the defilement which he said was harbored in this land, and not to nourish it so that it cannot be healed.	λέγοιμʼ ἂν οἷʼ ἤκουσα τοῦ θεοῦ πάρα. ἄνωγεν ἡμᾶς Φοῖβος ἐμφανῶς ἄναξ μίασμα χώρας, ὡς τεθραμμένον χθονὶ ἐν τῇδʼ, ἐλαύνειν μηδʼ ἀνήκεστον τρέφειν.
With what sort of purification? What is the manner of the misfortune?	ποίῳ καθαρμῷ; τίς ὁ τρόπος τῆς ξυμφορᾶς;
By banishing the man, or by paying back bloodshed with bloodshed, since it is this blood which brings the tempest on our city.	ἀνδρηλατοῦντας ἢ φόνῳ φόνον πάλιν λύοντας, ὡς τόδʼ αἷμα χειμάζον πόλιν.
And who is the man whose fate he thus reveals?	ποίου γὰρ ἀνδρὸς τήνδε μηνύει τύχην;
Laius, my lord, was the leader of our land before you assumed control of this state.	ἦν ἡμίν, ὦναξ, Λάϊός ποθʼ ἡγεμὼν γῆς τῆσδε, πρὶν σὲ τήνδʼ ἀπευθύνειν πόλιν.
I know it well—by hearsay, for I never saw him.	ἔξοιδʼ ἀκούων· οὐ γὰρ εἰσεῖδόν γέ πω.
He was slain, and the god now bids us to take vengeance on his murderers, whoever they are.	τούτου θανόντος νῦν ἐπιστέλλει σαφῶς τοὺς αὐτοέντας χειρὶ τιμωρεῖν τινας.
Where on earth are they? Where shall the dim track of this old crime be found?	οἳ δʼ εἰσὶ ποῦ γῆς; ποῦ τόδʼ εὑρεθήσεται ἴχνος παλαιᾶς δυστέκμαρτον αἰτίας;
In this land, the god said. What is sought for can be caught; only that which is not watched escapes.	ἐν τῇδʼ ἔφασκε γῇ· τὸ δὲ ζητούμενον ἁλωτόν, ἐκφεύγειν δὲ τἀμελούμενον.
Was it in the house, or in the field, or on foreign soil that Laius met his bloody end?	πότερα δʼ ἐν οἴκοις ἢ ʼν ἀγροῖς ὁ Λάϊος ἢ γῆς ἐπʼ ἄλλης τῷδε συμπίπτει φόνῳ;
He left our land, as he said, on a mission to Delphi .	θεωρός, ὡς ἔφασκεν, ἐκδημῶν, πάλιν
And once he had set forth, he never again returned.	πρὸς οἶκον οὐκέθʼ ἵκεθʼ, ὡς ἀπεστάλη.
And was there none to tell? Was there no travelling companion who saw the deed, from whom tidings might have been gained, and used?	οὐδʼ ἄγγελός τις οὐδὲ συμπράκτωρ ὁδοῦ κατεῖδʼ, ὅτου τις ἐκμαθὼν ἐχρήσατʼ ἄν;
All perished, save one who fled in fear, and he could tell with assurance only one thing of all that he saw.	θνῄσκουσι γάρ, πλὴν εἷς τις, ὃς φόβῳ, φυγὼν ὧν εἶδε πλὴν ἓν οὐδὲν εἶχʼ εἰδὼς φράσαι.
And what was that? One thing might hold the clue to many, if we could only get a small beginning for hope.	τὸ ποῖον; ἓν γὰρ πόλλʼ ἂν ἐξεύροι μαθεῖν, ἀρχὴν βραχεῖαν εἰ λάβοιμεν ἐλπίδος.
He said that robbers fell upon them, not one man alone, but with a great force.	λῃστὰς ἔφασκε συντυχόντας οὐ μιᾷ ῥώμῃ κτανεῖν νιν, ἀλλὰ σὺν πλήθει χερῶν.
How then, unless some intrigue had been worked with bribes	πῶς οὖν ὁ λῃστής, εἴ τι μὴ ξὺν ἀργύρῳ
from here in Thebes , would the robbers have been so bold?	ἐπράσσετʼ ἐνθένδʼ, ἐς τόδʼ ἂν τόλμης ἔβη;
Such things were surmised. But once Laius was slain no avenger arose in the midst of our troubles.	δοκοῦντα ταῦτʼ ἦν· Λαΐου δʼ ὀλωλότος οὐδεὶς ἀρωγὸς ἐν κακοῖς ἐγίγνετο.
But when royalty had fallen in this way, what trouble prevented a full search?	κακὸν δὲ ποῖον ἐμποδών, τυραννίδος οὕτω πεσούσης, εἶργε τοῦτʼ ἐξειδέναι;
The riddling Sphinx had forced us to let things that were obscure go, and to investigate the pressing trouble.	ἡ ποικιλῳδὸς Σφὶγξ τὸ πρὸς ποσὶν σκοπεῖν μεθέντας ἡμᾶς τἀφανῆ προσήγετο.
I will start afresh, and once more make dark things plain. Worthily has Phoebus Apollo—and worthily have you—bestowed this care on behalf of the dead. And so, as is fitting, you will find me allied with you	ἀλλʼ ἐξ ὑπαρχῆς αὖθις αὔτʼ ἐγὼ φανῶ· ἐπαξίως γὰρ Φοῖβος, ἀξίως δὲ σὺ πρὸ τοῦ θανόντος τήνδʼ ἔθεσθʼ ἐπιστροφήν·
in seeking vengeance for this land, and for the god as well. I will dispel this taint not on behalf of far-off friends, but for my own benefit. For whoever killed Laius	ὥστʼ ἐνδίκως ὄψεσθε κἀμὲ σύμμαχον γῇ τῇδε τιμωροῦντα τῷ θεῷ θʼ ἅμα. ὑπὲρ γὰρ οὐχὶ τῶν ἀπωτέρω φίλων, ἀλλʼ αὐτὸς αὑτοῦ τοῦτʼ ἀποσκεδῶ μύσος. ὅστις γὰρ ἦν ἐκεῖνον ὁ κτανών, τάχʼ ἂν
might wish to take vengeance on me also with a hand as fierce. Avenging Laius, therefore, I serve myself. Come, my children, as quickly as possible rise from the altar-steps, and lift these suppliant boughs. Let someone summon here Cadmus’ people, warning them that I will leave nothing untried.	κἄμʼ ἂν τοιαύτῃ χειρὶ τιμωροῦνθʼ ἕλοι. κείνῳ προσαρκῶν οὖν ἐμαυτὸν ὠφελῶ. ἀλλʼ ὡς τάχιστα, παῖδες, ὑμεῖς μὲν βάθρων ἵστασθε, τούσδʼ ἄραντες ἱκτῆρας κλάδους, ἄλλος δὲ Κάδμου λαὸν ὧδʼ ἀθροιζέτω,
For with the god’s help our good fortune—or our ruin—will be made certain.	ὡς πᾶν ἐμοῦ δράσοντος· ἢ γὰρ εὐτυχεῖς σὺν τῷ θεῷ φανούμεθʼ ἢ πεπτωκότες.
My children, let us rise. What we came to seek, this man promises of his own accord. And may Phoebus, who sent these oracles,	ὦ παῖδες, ἱστώμεσθα· τῶνδε γὰρ χάριν καὶ δεῦρʼ ἔβημεν ὧν ὅδʼ ἐξαγγέλλεται. Φοῖβος δʼ ὁ πέμψας τάσδε μαντείας ἅμα
come to us as savior and deliverer from the pestilence.	σωτήρ δʼ ἵκοιτο καὶ νόσου παυστήριος.
O sweetly-speaking message of Zeus, in what spirit have you come to glorious Thebes from golden Pytho ? I am on the rack, terror shakes my soul, O Delian healer to whom wild cries rise,	ὦ Διὸς ἁδυεπὲς φάτι, τίς ποτε τᾶς πολυχρύσου Πυθῶνος ἀγλαὰς ἔβας Θήβας; ἐκτέταμαι φοβερὰν φρένα, δείματι πάλλων, ἰήιε Δάλιε Παιάν,
in holy fear of you, wondering what debt you will extract from me, perhaps unknown before, perhaps renewed with the revolving years. Tell me, immortal Voice, child of golden Hope.	ἀμφὶ σοὶ ἁζόμενος τί μοι ἢ νέον ἢ περιτελλομέναις ὥραις πάλιν ἐξανύσεις χρέος. εἰπέ μοι, ὦ χρυσέας τέκνον Ἐλπίδος, ἄμβροτε Φάμα.
and on your sister, Artemis, guardian of our earth, who sits on her glorious throne above the circle of our market-place, and on far-shooting Apollo: oh shine forth for me, my three-fold help against death!	πρῶτα σὲ κεκλόμενος, θύγατερ Διός, ἄμβροτʼ Ἀθάνα γαιάοχόν τʼ ἀδελφεὰν Ἄρτεμιν, ἃ κυκλόεντʼ ἀγορᾶς θρόνον εὐκλέα θάσσει, καὶ Φοῖβον ἑκαβόλον, ἰὼ τρισσοὶ ἀλεξίμοροι προφάνητέ μοι,
If ever before you drove a fiery pest from our borders to stop ruin rushing upon our city, come now also!	εἴ ποτε καὶ προτέρας ἄτας ὕπερ ὀρνυμένας πόλει ἠνύσατʼ ἐκτοπίαν φλόγα πήματος, ἔλθετε καὶ νῦν.
Alas, countless are the sorrows I bear.	ὦ πόποι, ἀνάριθμα γὰρ φέρω
A plague is on all our people, and thought can find no weapon for defense. The fruits of the glorious earth do not grow; by no birth of offspring do women surmount the pangs in which they shriek.	πήματα· νοσεῖ δέ μοι πρόπας στόλος, οὐδʼ ἔνι φροντίδος ἔγχος ᾧ τις ἀλέξεται. οὔτε γὰρ ἔκγονα κλυτᾶς χθονὸς αὔξεται οὔτε τόκοισιν ἰηίων καμάτων ἀνέχουσι γυναῖκες·
You can see life after life speed away, like a bird on the wing, swifter than irresistible fire, to the shore of the western god.	ἄλλον δʼ ἂν ἄλλῳ προσίδοις ἅπερ εὔπτερον ὄρνιν κρεῖσσον ἀμαιμακέτου πυρὸς ὄρμενον ἀκτὰν πρὸς ἑσπέρου θεοῦ.
With such deaths, past numbering, the city perishes.	ὧν πόλις ἀνάριθμος ὄλλυται·
Unpitied, her children lie on the ground, spreading pestilence, with no one to mourn them. Meanwhile young wives and grey-haired mothers raise a wail at the steps of the altars, some here, some there,	νηλέα δὲ γένεθλα πρὸς πέδῳ θαναταφόρα κεῖται ἀνοίκτως· ἐν δʼ ἄλοχοι πολιαί τʼ ἔπι ματέρες ἀχὰν παραβώμιον ἄλλοθεν ἄλλαν λυγρῶν πόνων ἱκετῆρες ἐπιστενάχουσιν.
and groan in supplication for their terrible woes. The prayers to the Healer ring clear, and with them the voice of lamentation. For which things, golden daughter of Zeus, send us the bright face of comfort.	παιὰν δὲ λάμπει στονόεσσά τε γῆρυς ὅμαυλος ὧν ὕπερ, ὦ χρυσέα θύγατερ Διός, εὐῶπα πέμψον ἀλκάν.
Grant that the fierce god of death, who now without the bronze of shields, though among cries like those of battle, wraps me in the flames of his onset, may turn his back in speedy flight from our land, borne by a favorable wind to the great chamber of Amphitrite,	Ἄρεά τε τὸν μαλερόν, ὃς νῦν ἄχαλκος ἀσπίδων φλέγει με περιβόατον, ἀντιάζω παλίσσυτον δράμημα νωτίσαι πάτρας ἔπουρον, εἴτʼ ἐς μέγαν θάλαμον Ἀμφιτρίτας
or to the Thracian waves, those waters where none find haven. For if night leaves anything undone in the working of destruction, day follows to accomplish it. You who wield the	εἴτʼ ἐς τὸν ἀπόξενον ὅρμων Θρῄκιον κλύδωνα· τελεῖν γὰρ εἴ τι νὺξ ἀφῇ, τοῦτʼ ἐπʼ ἦμαρ ἔρχεται· τόν, ὦ τᾶν πυρφόρων
powers of fiery lightning, Zeus our father, slay him beneath your thunder-bolt.	ἀστραπᾶν κράτη νέμων, ὦ Ζεῦ πάτερ, ὑπὸ σῷ φθίσον κεραυνῷ,
Lycean Lord, would that the shafts from your bent bow’s string of woven gold might	Λύκειʼ ἄναξ, τά τε σὰ χρυσοστρόφων ἀπʼ ἀγκυλᾶν βέλεα θέλοιμʼ ἂν ἀδάματʼ ἐνδατεῖσθαι
go forth in their might, our champions in the face of the foe, and the flashing fires of Artemis too, with which she darts through the Lycian hills. I call him whose locks are bound with gold,	ἀρωγὰ προσταχθέντα τάς τε πυρφόρους Ἀρτέμιδος αἴγλας, ξὺν αἷς Λύκιʼ ὄρεα διᾴσσει· τὸν χρυσομίτραν τε κικλήσκω,
who is named with the name of this land, ruddy Bacchus to whom Bacchants cry, to draw near with the blaze of his shining torch,	τᾶσδʼ ἐπώνυμον γᾶς, οἰνῶπα Βάκχον εὔιον, Μαινάδων ὁμόστολον, πελασθῆναι φλέγοντʼ ἀγλαῶπι ¯ ˘ ¯
our ally against the god unhonored among the gods.	πεύκᾳ ʼπὶ τὸν ἀπότιμον ἐν θεοῖς θεόν.
You pray. And in answer to your prayer, if you will give a loyal reception to my words and minister to your own disease, you may hope to find help and relief from woes. These words I will speak publicly, as one who was a stranger to the report,	αἰτεῖς· ἃ δʼ αἰτεῖς, τἄμʼ ἐὰν θέλῃς ἔπη κλύων δέχεσθαι τῇ νόσῳ θʼ ὑπηρετεῖν, ἀλκὴν λάβοις ἂν κἀνακούφισιν κακῶν· ἁγὼ ξένος μὲν τοῦ λόγου τοῦδʼ ἐξερῶ,
a stranger to the deed. I would not go far on the trail if I were tracing it alone, without a clue. But as it is—since it was only after the event that I was counted a Theban among Thebans—to you, Cadmeans all, I do thus proclaim: Whoever knows	ξένος δὲ τοῦ πραχθέντος· οὐ γὰρ ἂν μακρὰν ἴχνευον αὐτός, μὴ οὐκ ἔχων τι σύμβολον, νῦν δʼ ὕστερος γὰρ ἀστὸς εἰς ἀστοὺς τελῶ, ὑμῖν προφωνῶ πᾶσι Καδμείοις τάδε· ὅστις ποθʼ ὑμῶν Λάϊον τὸν Λαβδάκου
by whom Laius son of Labdacus was slain, I order him to declare all to me. And if he is afraid, I order him to remove the danger of indictment from his path by denouncing himself: he will suffer no other punishment, but will only leave this land, unhurt.	κάτοιδεν ἀνδρὸς ἐκ τίνος διώλετο, τοῦτον κελεύω πάντα σημαίνειν ἐμοί· κεἰ μὲν φοβεῖται, τοὐπίκλημʼ ὑπεξελεῖν αὐτὸν καθʼ αὑτοῦ· πείσεται γὰρ ἄλλο μὲν ἀστεργὲς οὐδέν. γῆς δʼ ἄπεισιν ἀσφαλής.
If anyone knows the assassin to be an alien, from another land, let him not keep silent. I will reward him, and my thanks shall rest with him besides. But if he keeps silent, if anyone, through fear, seeks to screen himself or a friend from my orders,	εἰ δʼ αὖ τις ἄλλον οἶδεν ἐξ ἄλλης χθονὸς τὸν αὐτόχειρα, μὴ σιωπάτω· τὸ γὰρ κέρδος τελῶ ʼγὼ χἠ χάρις προσκείσεται. εἰ δʼ αὖ σιωπήσεσθε, καί τις ἢ φίλου δείσας ἀπώσει τοὔπος ἢ χαὐτοῦ τόδε,
then hear what I shall do: I charge you that no resident of this land, which I rule, give shelter to or address that murderer, whoever he is, or make him a partner in prayer or sacrifice,	ἃκ τῶνδε δράσω, ταῦτα χρὴ κλύειν ἐμοῦ. τὸν ἄνδρʼ ἀπαυδῶ τοῦτον, ὅστις ἐστί, γῆς τῆσδʼ, ἧς ἐγὼ κράτη τε καὶ θρόνους νέμω, μήτʼ εἰσδέχεσθαι μήτε προσφωνεῖν τινα, μήτʼ ἐν θεῶν εὐχαῖσι μήτε θύμασιν
or give him a share of the lustral rite. Ban him from your houses, all of you, knowing that this is the defilement, as the oracle of the Pythian god has recently shown to me. In this way	κοινὸν ποεῖσθαι, μήτε χέρνιβας νέμειν· ὠθεῖν δʼ ἀπʼ οἴκων πάντας, ὡς μιάσματος τοῦδʼ ἡμὶν ὄντος, ὡς τὸ Πυθικὸν θεοῦ μαντεῖον ἐξέφηνεν ἀρτίως ἐμοί. ἐγὼ μὲν οὖν τοιόσδε τῷ τε δαίμονι
I am an ally both to the god and to the dead man. And I pray solemnly that the slayer, whoever he is, whether he alone is guilty or he has partners, may, in the horrible way he deserves, wear out his unblest life. And for myself I pray that if he should,	τῷ τʼ ἀνδρὶ τῷ θανόντι σύμμαχος πέλω· κατεύχομαι δὲ τὸν δεδρακότʼ, εἴτε τις εἷς ὢν λέληθεν εἴτε πλειόνων μέτα, κακὸν κακῶς νιν ἄμορον ἐκτρῖψαι βίον· ἐπεύχομαι δʼ, οἴκοισιν εἰ ξυνέστιος
with my knowledge, become a resident of my house, I may suffer the same things which I have just called down on others. And I order you to make all these words good, for my sake, for the sake of the god, and for the sake of our land, thus rendered unfruitful and ungodly.	ἐν τοῖς ἐμοῖς γένοιτʼ ἐμοῦ συνειδότος, παθεῖν ἅπερ τοῖσδʼ ἀρτίως ἠρασάμην. ὑμῖν δὲ ταῦτα πάντʼ ἐπισκήπτω τελεῖν, ὑπέρ τʼ ἐμαυτοῦ τοῦ θεοῦ τε τῆσδέ τε γῆς ὧδʼ ἀκάρπως κἀθέως ἐφθαρμένης.
For even if the matter had not been urged upon us by a god, it still would not have been fit that you should leave the guilt unpunished as it is, when one so noble—and he your king—had perished. You should have searched it out. But now, since I hold the powers which he once held,	οὐδʼ εἰ γὰρ ἦν τὸ πρᾶγμα μὴ θεήλατον, ἀκάθαρτον ὑμᾶς εἰκὸς ἦν οὕτως ἐᾶν, ἀνδρός γʼ ἀρίστου βασιλέως τʼ ὀλωλότος, ἀλλʼ ἐξερευνᾶν· νῦν δʼ ἐπεὶ κυρῶ γʼ ἐγὼ ἔχων μὲν ἀρχὰς ἃς ἐκεῖνος εἶχε πρίν,
possessing his bed and the wife who bore his children, and since, had his hope of offspring not been unsuccessful, children born of one mother would have tied us with a common bond—as it was, fate swooped upon his head—I will uphold this cause, as though it were that of my own father,	ἔχων δὲ λέκτρα καὶ γυναῖχʼ ὁμόσπορον, κοινῶν τε παίδων κοίνʼ ἄν, εἰ κείνῳ γένος μὴ ʼδυστύχησεν, ἦν ἂν ἐκπεφυκότα· νῦν δʼ ἐς τὸ κείνου κρᾶτʼ ἐνήλαθʼ ἡ τύχη· ἀνθʼ ὧν ἐγὼ τάδʼ, ὡσπερεὶ τοὐμοῦ πατρός,
and will leave no stone unturned in my search for the one who shed the blood, for the honor of the son of Labdacus and of Polydorus and the elder Cadmus and Agenor of old. And for those who do not obey me, I pray that the gods	ὑπερμαχοῦμαι κἀπὶ πᾶν ἀφίξομαι, ζητῶν τὸν αὐτόχειρα τοῦ φόνου λαβεῖν, τῷ Λαβδακείῳ παιδὶ Πολυδώρου τε καὶ τοῦ πρόσθε Κάδμου τοῦ πάλαι τʼ Ἀγήνορος. καὶ ταῦτα τοῖς μὴ δρῶσιν εὔχομαι θεοὺς
send them neither harvest of the earth nor fruit of the womb, but that they perish with the present fate, or one still worse. But to all you, the loyal Cadmeans who are satisfied by these things, may justice, our ally,	μήτʼ ἄροτον αὐτοῖς γῆς ἀνιέναι τινὰ μήτʼ οὖν γυναικῶν παῖδας, ἀλλὰ τῷ πότμῳ τῷ νῦν φθερεῖσθαι κἄτι τοῦδʼ ἐχθίονι· ὑμῖν δὲ τοῖς ἄλλοισι Καδμείοις, ὅσοις τάδʼ ἔστʼ ἀρέσκονθʼ, ἥ τε σύμμαχος Δίκη
and all the gods be gracious always.	χοἰ πάντες εὖ ξυνεῖεν εἰσαεὶ θεοί.
As you have put me under oath, on my oath, my king, I will speak. I am not the slayer, nor can I reveal him. As for the investigation, it was for Phoebus, who enjoined it, to tell us who did the deed.	ὥσπερ μʼ ἀραῖον ἔλαβες, ὧδʼ, ἄναξ, ἐρῶ. οὔτʼ ἔκτανον γὰρ οὔτε τὸν κτανόντʼ ἔχω δεῖξαι. τὸ δὲ ζήτημα τοῦ πέμψαντος ἦν Φοίβου τόδʼ εἰπεῖν, ὅστις εἴργασταί ποτε.
Justly said. But no man on earth can force the gods to do what they do not want.	δίκαιʼ ἔλεξας· ἀλλʼ ἀναγκάσαι θεοὺς ἃν μὴ θέλωσιν οὐδʼ ἂν εἷς δύναιτʼ ἀνήρ.
I would like to say what seems to me the next best course.	τὰ δεύτερʼ ἐκ τῶνδʼ ἂν λέγοιμʼ ἁμοὶ δοκεῖ.
And if there is a third course, do not hesitate to reveal it too.	εἰ καὶ τρίτʼ ἐστί, μὴ παρῇς τὸ μὴ οὐ φράσαι.
I know that our lord Teiresias is the seer most like our	ἄνακτʼ ἄνακτι ταὔθʼ ὁρῶντʼ ἐπίσταμαι
lord Apollo: from him, my king, an investigator might learn most clearly about these affairs.	μάλιστα Φοίβῳ Τειρεσίαν, παρʼ οὗ τις ἂν σκοπῶν τάδʼ, ὦναξ, ἐκμάθοι σαφέστατα.
Not even this have I neglected. On Creon’s suggestion, I sent a man twice to bring him. And I have been wondering for some time why he is not here.	ἀλλʼ οὐκ ἐν ἀργοῖς οὐδὲ τοῦτʼ ἐπραξάμην. ἔπεμψα γὰρ Κρέοντος εἰπόντος διπλοῦς πομπούς· πάλαι δὲ μὴ παρῶν θαυμάζεται.
Indeed—his skill apart—the rumors are but faint and old.	καὶ μὴν τά γʼ ἄλλα κωφὰ καὶ παλαίʼ ἔπη.
What are the rumors? I am investigating every tale.	τὰ ποῖα ταῦτα; πάντα γὰρ σκοπῶ λόγον.
He was said to have been killed by some wayfarers.	θανεῖν ἐλέχθη πρός τινων ὁδοιπόρων.
I too have heard that. But no one sees the one who saw it.	ἤκουσα κἀγώ. τὸν δʼ ἰδόντʼ οὐδεὶς ὁρᾷ.
If he knows what fear is, he will not hesitate to come forward when he	ἀλλʼ εἴ τι μὲν δὴ δείματός γʼ ἔχει μέρος,
hears your curses, so dire are they.	τὰς σὰς ἀκούων οὐ μενεῖ τοιάσδʼ ἀράς,
When a man does not shrink from a deed, he is not scared by a word.	ᾧ μή ʼστι δρῶντι τάρβος, οὐδʼ ἔπος φοβεῖ.
But there is one to convict him. But here they bring at last the godlike prophet, the only man in whom truth lives.	ἀλλʼ οὑξελέγξων αὐτὸν ἔστιν· οἵδε γὰρ τὸν θεῖον ἤδη μάντιν ὧδʼ ἄγουσιν, ᾧ τἀληθὲς ἐμπέφυκεν ἀνθρώπων μόνῳ.
Teiresias, whose soul grasps all things, both that which may be told and that which is unspeakable, the Olympian secrets and the affairs of the earth, you feel, though you cannot see, what a huge plague haunts our state. From which, great prophet, we find you to be our protector and only savior.	ὦ πάντα νωμῶν Τειρεσία, διδακτά τε ἄρρητά τʼ, οὐράνιά τε καὶ χθονοστιβῆ, πόλιν μέν, εἰ καὶ μὴ βλέπεις, φρονεῖς δʼ ὅμως οἵᾳ νόσῳ σύνεστιν· ἧς σὲ προστάτην σωτῆρά τʼ, ὦναξ, μοῦνον ἐξευρίσκομεν.
Now, Phoebus—if indeed you have not already heard the news—sent answer to our question that the only way to rid ourselves of this pest that afflicts us is to discover the slayers of Laius, and then to slay them or banish them from our land.	Φοῖβος γάρ, εἴ τι μὴ κλύεις τῶν ἀγγέλων, πέμψασιν ἡμῖν ἀντέπεμψεν, ἔκλυσιν μόνην ἂν ἐλθεῖν τοῦδε τοῦ νοσήματος, εἰ τοὺς κτανόντας Λάϊον μαθόντες εὖ κτείναιμεν ἢ γῆς φυγάδας ἐκπεμψαίμεθα.
So do not begrudge us the voice of the birds or any other path of prophecy, but save yourself and your state, save me, save all that is defiled by the dead. We are in your hands, and man’s noblest task is to help others	σύ νυν φθονήσας μήτʼ ἀπʼ οἰωνῶν φάτιν μήτʼ εἴ τινʼ ἄλλην μαντικῆς ἔχεις ὁδόν, ῥῦσαι σεαυτὸν καὶ πόλιν, ῥῦσαι δʼ ἐμέ, ῥῦσαι δὲ πᾶν μίασμα τοῦ τεθνηκότος. ἐν σοὶ γὰρ ἐσμέν· ἄνδρα δʼ ὠφελεῖν ἀφʼ ὧν
to the best of his means and powers.	ἔχοι τε καὶ δύναιτο, κάλλιστος πόνων.
Alas, how terrible it is to have wisdom when it does not benefit those who have it. I knew this well, but let it slip from my mind: otherwise I would not have come here.	φεῦ φεῦ, φρονεῖν ὡς δεινὸν ἔνθα μὴ τέλη λύῃ φρονοῦντι· ταῦτα γὰρ καλῶς ἐγὼ εἰδὼς διώλεσʼ· οὐ γὰρ ἂν δεῦρʼ ἱκόμην.
What now? How disheartened you have come!	τί δʼ ἔστιν; ὡς ἄθυμος εἰσελήλυθας.
Let me go home. For you will bear your own burden to the end, and I will bear mine, if you consent.	ἄφες μʼ ἐς οἴκους· ῥᾷστα γὰρ τὸ σόν τε σὺ κἀγὼ διοίσω τοὐμόν, ἢν ἐμοὶ πίθῃ.
Your words are strange and unkind to the state which nurtured you, since you withhold this response.	οὔτʼ ἔννομʼ εἶπας οὔτε προσφιλῆ πόλει τῇδʼ, ἥ σʼ ἔθρεψε, τήνδʼ ἀποστερῶν φάτιν.
I see that you, for your part, speak inappropriately.	ὁρῶ γὰρ οὐδὲ σοὶ τὸ σὸν φώνημʼ ἰὸν
Therefore do not speak, so I will not suffer the same.	πρὸς καιρόν· ὡς οὖν μηδʼ ἐγὼ ταὐτὸν πάθω—
For the love of the gods, do not turn away, if you have knowledge: all we suppliants implore you on our knees.	μὴ πρὸς θεῶν φρονῶν γʼ ἀποστραφῇς, ἐπεὶ πάντες σε προσκυνοῦμεν οἵδʼ ἱκτήριοι.
For all of you are without knowledge. But never will I reveal my troubles—not to call them yours.	πάντες γὰρ οὐ φρονεῖτʼ· ἐγὼ δʼ οὐ μή ποτε τἄμʼ, ὡς ἂν εἴπω μὴ τὰ σʼ, ἐκφήνω κακά.
What are you saying? Do you know the secret and refuse to tell it? Will you betray and destroy the state?	τί φής; ξυνειδὼς οὐ φράσεις, ἀλλʼ ἐννοεῖς ἡμᾶς προδοῦναι καὶ καταφθεῖραι πόλιν;
I will grieve neither myself nor you. Why do you ask these things in vain? You will not learn the answers from me.	ἐγὼ οὔτʼ ἐμαυτὸν οὔτε σʼ ἀλγυνῶ. τί ταῦτʼ ἄλλως ἐλέγχεις; οὐ γὰρ ἂν πύθοιό μου.
Will you not, basest of the base—	οὐκ, ὦ κακῶν κάκιστε, καὶ γὰρ ἂν πέτρου
you would anger a stone—speak out? can nothing touch you? Will you never make an end?	φύσιν σύ γʼ ὀργάνειας, ἐξερεῖς ποτε, ἀλλʼ ὧδʼ ἄτεγκτος κἀτελεύτητος φανεῖ;
You blame my anger, but do not perceive your own: no, you blame me.	ὀργὴν ἐμέμψω τὴν ἐμήν, τὴν σὴν δʼ ὁμοῦ ναίουσαν οὐ κατεῖδες, ἀλλʼ ἐμὲ ψέγεις.
Who would not be angry hearing such words,	τίς γὰρ τοιαῦτʼ ἂν οὐκ ἂν ὀργίζοιτʼ ἔπη
with which you now are slighting the city?	κλύων, ἃ νῦν σὺ τήνδʼ ἀτιμάζεις πόλιν;
The future will come of itself, though I shroud it in silence.	ἥξει γὰρ αὐτά, κἂν ἐγὼ σιγῇ στέγω.
Since it must come anyway, it is right that you tell it to me.	οὐκοῦν ἅ γʼ ἥξει καὶ σὲ χρὴ λέγειν ἐμοί.
I will speak no further: rage, if you wish, with the fiercest wrath your heart knows.	οὐκ ἂν πέρα φράσαιμι. πρὸς τάδʼ, εἰ θέλεις, θυμοῦ διʼ ὀργῆς ἥτις ἀγριωτάτη.
In my anger I will not spare to speak all my thoughts. Know that you seem to me to have helped in plotting the deed, and to have done it, short of performing the actual murder with your own hands: if you had eyesight, I would have said that you had done even this by yourself.	καὶ μὴν παρήσω γʼ οὐδέν, ὡς ὀργῆς ἔχω, ἅπερ ξυνίημʼ· ἴσθι γὰρ δοκῶν ἐμοὶ καὶ ξυμφυτεῦσαι τοὔργον εἰργάσθαι θʼ, ὅσον μὴ χερσὶ καίνων· εἰ δʼ ἐτύγχανες βλέπων, καὶ τοὔργον ἂν σοῦ τοῦτʼ, ἔφην εἶναι μόνου.
In truth? I order you to abide by you own decree, and from this day forth not to speak to these men or to me: you are the accursed defiler of this land.	ἄληθες; ἐννέπω σὲ τῷ κηρύγματι ᾧπερ προεῖπας ἐμμένειν, κἀφʼ ἡμέρας τῆς νῦν προσαυδᾶν μήτε τούσδε μήτʼ ἐμέ, ὡς ὄντι γῆς τῆσδʼ ἀνοσίῳ μιάστορι.
So brazen with your blustering taunt?	οὕτως ἀναιδῶς ἐξεκίνησας τόδε
Where do you think to escape to?	τὸ ῥῆμα; καὶ ποῦ τοῦτο φεύξεσθαι δοκεῖς;
I have escaped. There is strength in my truth.	πέφευγα· τἀληθὲς γὰρ ἰσχῦον τρέφω.
Who taught you this? Not your skill, at any rate.	πρὸς τοῦ διδαχθείς; οὐ γὰρ ἔκ γε τῆς τέχνης.
You yourself. For you spurred me on to speak against my will.	πρὸς σοῦ· σὺ γάρ μʼ ἄκοντα προυτρέψω λέγειν.
What did you say? Speak again, so I may learn it better.	ποῖον λόγον; λέγʼ αὖθις, ὡς μᾶλλον μάθω.
Did you not understand before, or are you talking to test me?	οὐχὶ ξυνῆκας πρόσθεν; ἢ ʼκπειρᾷ λέγων;
I cannot say I understood fully. Tell me again.	οὐχ ὥστε γʼ εἰπεῖν γνωστόν· ἀλλʼ αὖθις φράσον.
I say that you are the killer of the man whose slayer you seek.	φονέα σε φημὶ τἀνδρὸς οὗ ζητεῖς κυρεῖν.
Now you will regret that you have said such dire words twice.	ἀλλʼ οὔ τι χαίρων δίς γε πημονὰς ἐρεῖς.
Should I tell you more, that you might get more angry?	εἴπω τι δῆτα κἄλλʼ, ἵνʼ ὀργίζῃ πλέον;
Say as much as you want: it will be said in vain.	ὅσον γε χρῄζεις· ὡς μάτην εἰρήσεται.
I say that you have been living in unguessed shame with your closest kin, and do not see into what woe you have fallen.	λεληθέναι σε φημὶ σὺν τοῖς φιλτάτοις αἴσχισθʼ ὁμιλοῦντʼ, οὐδʼ ὁρᾶν ἵνʼ εἶ κακοῦ.
Do you think that you will always be able to speak like this without smarting for it?	ἦ καὶ γεγηθὼς ταῦτʼ ἀεὶ λέξειν δοκεῖς;
Yes, if indeed there is any strength in truth.	εἴπερ τί γʼ ἐστὶ τῆς ἀληθείας σθένος.
But there is, except not for you. You do not have that strength, since you are maimed in your ears, in your wit, and in your eyes.	ἀλλʼ ἔστι, πλὴν σοί· σοὶ δὲ τοῦτʼ οὐκ ἔστʼ ἐπεὶ τυφλὸς τά τʼ ὦτα τόν τε νοῦν τά τʼ ὄμματʼ εἶ.
And you are a poor wretch to utter taunts that every man here will soon hurl at you.	σὺ δʼ ἄθλιός γε ταῦτʼ ὀνειδίζων, ἃ σοὶ οὐδεὶς ὃς οὐχὶ τῶνδʼ ὀνειδιεῖ τάχα.
Night, endless night has you in her keeping, so that you can never hurt me,	μιᾶς τρέφει πρὸς νυκτός, ὥστε μήτʼ ἐμὲ
or any man that sees the light of the sun.	μήτʼ ἄλλον, ὅστις φῶς ὁρᾷ, βλάψαι ποτʼ ἄν.
No, it is not your fate to fall at my hands, since Apollo, to whom this matter is a concern, is sufficient.	οὐ γάρ σε μοῖρα πρός γʼ ἐμοῦ πεσεῖν, ἐπεὶ ἱκανὸς Ἀπόλλων, ᾧ τάδʼ ἐκπρᾶξαι μέλει.
Are these Creon’s devices, or your own?	Κρέοντος ἢ σοῦ ταῦτα τἀξευρήματα;
Creon is no trouble for you: you are your own.	Κρέων δέ σοι πῆμʼ οὐδέν, ἀλλʼ αὐτὸς σὺ σοί.
O wealth, and empire, and skill surpassing skill in life’s keen rivalries, how great is the envy in your keeping, if for the sake of this office which the city has entrusted to me, a gift unsought,	ὦ πλοῦτε καὶ τυραννὶ καὶ τέχνη τέχνης ὑπερφέρουσα τῷ πολυζήλῳ βίῳ, ὅσος παρʼ ὑμῖν ὁ φθόνος φυλάσσεται, εἰ τῆσδέ γʼ ἀρχῆς οὕνεχʼ, ἣν ἐμοὶ πόλις δωρητόν, οὐκ αἰτητόν, εἰσεχείρισεν,
Creon the trustworthy, Creon, my old friend, has crept upon me by stealth, yearning to overthrow me, and has suborned such a scheming juggler as this, a tricky quack, who has eyes only for profit, but is blind in his art!	ταύτης Κρέων ὁ πιστός, οὑξ ἀρχῆς φίλος, λάθρᾳ μʼ ὑπελθὼν ἐκβαλεῖν ἱμείρεται, ὑφεὶς μάγον τοιόνδε μηχανορράφον, δόλιον ἀγύρτην, ὅστις ἐν τοῖς κέρδεσιν μόνον δέδορκε, τὴν τέχνην δʼ ἔφυ τυφλός.
Come, tell me, where have you proved yourself a seer? Why, when the watchful dog who wove dark song was here, did you say nothing to free the people? Yet the riddle, at least, was not for the first comer to read: there was need of a seer’s help,	ἐπεί, φέρʼ εἰπέ, ποῦ σὺ μάντις εἶ σαφής; πῶς οὐκ, ὅθʼ ἡ ῥαψῳδὸς ἐνθάδʼ ἦν κύων, ηὔδας τι τοῖσδʼ ἀστοῖσιν ἐκλυτήριον; καίτοι τό γʼ αἴνιγμʼ οὐχὶ τοὐπιόντος ἦν ἀνδρὸς διειπεῖν, ἀλλὰ μαντείας ἔδει·
and you were discovered not to have this art, either from birds, or known from some god. But rather I, Oedipus the ignorant, stopped her, having attained the answer through my wit alone, untaught by birds. It is I whom you are trying to oust, assuming that	ἣν οὔτʼ ἀπʼ οἰωνῶν σὺ προυφάνης ἔχων οὔτʼ ἐκ θεῶν του γνωτόν· ἀλλʼ ἐγὼ μολών, ὁ μηδὲν εἰδὼς Οἰδίπους, ἔπαυσά νιν, γνώμῃ κυρήσας οὐδʼ ἀπʼ, οἰωνῶν μαθών· ὃν δὴ σὺ πειρᾷς ἐκβαλεῖν, δοκῶν θρόνοις
you will have great influence in Creon’s court. But I think that you and the one who plotted these things will rue your zeal to purge the land: if you did not seem to be an old man, you would have learned to your cost how haughty you are.	παραστατήσειν τοῖς Κρεοντείοις πέλας. κλαίων δοκεῖς μοι καὶ σὺ χὠ συνθεὶς τάδε ἀγηλατήσειν· εἰ δὲ μὴ ʼδόκεις γέρων εἶναι, παθὼν ἔγνως ἂν οἷά περ φρονεῖς.
To our way of thinking, these words, both his and yours, Oedipus,	ἡμῖν μὲν εἰκάζουσι καὶ τὰ τοῦδʼ ἔπη
have been said in anger. We have no need of this, but rather we must seek how we shall best discharge the mandates of the god.	ὀργῇ λελέχθαι καὶ τά σʼ, Οἰδίπους, δοκεῖ, δεῖ δʼ οὐ τοιούτων, ἀλλʼ ὅπως τὰ τοῦ θεοῦ μαντεῖʼ ἄριστα λύσομεν, τόδε σκοπεῖν.
Though you are king, the right of reply must be considered the same for both: over that I have control.	εἰ καὶ τυραννεῖς, ἐξισωτέον τὸ γοῦν ἴσʼ ἀντιλέξαι· τοῦδε γὰρ κἀγὼ κρατῶ.
For I do not live as your slave, but as Loxias’. I will not stand enrolled as Creon’s client. And I tell you, since you have taunted my blindness, that though you have sight, you do not see what a state of misery you are in, or where you dwell, or with whom.	οὐ γάρ τι σοὶ ζῶ δοῦλος, ἀλλὰ Λοξίᾳ· ὥστʼ οὐ Κρέοντος προστάτου γεγράψομαι. λέγω δʼ, ἐπειδὴ καὶ τυφλόν μʼ ὠνείδισας· σὺ καὶ δέδορκας κοὐ βλέπεις ἵνʼ εἶ κακοῦ, οὐδʼ ἔνθα ναίεις, οὐδʼ ὅτων οἰκεῖς μέτα.
Do you know who your parents are? You have been an unwitting enemy to your own kin, both in the Underworld and on the earth above, and the double lash of your mother’s and your father’s curse will one day drive you from this land in dreadful haste, with darkness upon those eyes of yours which now can see.	ἆρʼ οἶσθʼ ἀφʼ ὧν εἶ; καὶ λέληθας ἐχθρὸς ὢν τοῖς σοῖσιν αὐτοῦ νέρθε κἀπὶ γῆς ἄνω, καί σʼ ἀμφιπλὴξ μητρός τε καὶ τοῦ σοῦ πατρὸς ἐλᾷ ποτʼ ἐκ γῆς τῆσδε δεινόπους ἀρά, βλέποντα νῦν μὲν ὄρθʼ, ἔπειτα δὲ σκότον.
What place will be harbor to your cries, what part of all Cithaeron will not ring with them soon, when you have learned the meaning of the nuptials in which, within that house, you found a fatal haven, after a voyage so fair? And you have not guessed at a throng of other ills	βοῆς δὲ τῆς σῆς ποῖος οὐκ ἔσται λιμήν, ποῖος Κιθαιρὼν οὐχὶ σύμφωνος τάχα, ὅταν καταίσθῃ τὸν ὑμέναιον, ὃν δόμοις ἄνορμον εἰσέπλευσας, εὐπλοίας τυχών; ἄλλων δὲ πλῆθος οὐκ ἐπαισθάνει κακῶν,
which will bring you level with your true self and with your own children. Therefore heap your scorn upon Creon and upon my message: for no man will ever be crushed more miserably than you.	ἅ σʼ ἐξισώσει σοί τε καὶ τοῖς σοῖς τέκνοις. πρὸς ταῦτα καὶ Κρέοντα καὶ τοὐμὸν στόμα προπηλάκιζε· σοῦ γὰρ οὐκ ἔστιν βροτῶν κάκιον ὅστις ἐκτριβήσεταί ποτε.
Are these taunts to be endured from him?	ἦ ταῦτα δῆτʼ ἀνεκτὰ πρὸς τούτου κλύειν;
Be gone, to your ruin; be gone this instant! Will you not turn your back and leave this house?	οὐκ εἰς ὄλεθρον; οὐχὶ θᾶσσον; οὐ πάλιν ἄψορρος οἴκων τῶνδʼ ἀποστραφεὶς ἄπει;
I would not have come if you had not called me.	οὐδʼ ἱκόμην ἔγωγʼ ἄν, εἰ σὺ μὴ ʼκάλεις.
I did not know you would speak foolishly, for otherwise it would have been a long time before I summoned you to my home.	οὐ γάρ τί σʼ ᾔδη μῶρα φωνήσοντʼ, ἐπεὶ σχολῇ σʼ ἂν οἴκους τοὺς ἐμοὺς ἐστειλάμην.
I was born like this—as you think, a fool, but in the opinion of the parents who bore you, quite sane.	ἡμεῖς τοιοίδʼ ἔφυμεν, ὡς μὲν σοὶ δοκεῖ, μῶροι, γονεῦσι δʼ, οἵ σʼ ἔφυσαν, ἔμφρονες.
What parents? Wait. What man is my father?	ποίοισι; μεῖνον, τίς δέ μʼ ἐκφύει βροτῶν;
This day will reveal your birth and bring your ruin.	ἥδʼ ἡμέρα φύσει σε καὶ διαφθερεῖ.
What riddles, what dark words you always say.	ὡς πάντʼ ἄγαν αἰνικτὰ κἀσαφῆ λέγεις.
Are you not the best at unravelling mysteries?	οὔκουν σὺ ταῦτʼ ἄριστος εὑρίσκειν ἔφυς;
Reproach me in what you will find me to be great.	τοιαῦτʼ ὀνείδιζʼ, οἷς ἔμʼ εὑρήσεις μέγαν.
Yet it was just that fortune that undid you.	αὕτη γε μέντοι σʼ ἡ τύχη διώλεσεν.
But if it saved this city I care not.	ἀλλʼ εἰ πόλιν τήνδʼ ἐξέσωσʼ, οὔ μοι μέλει.
I will take my leave. You, boy, lead me.	ἄπειμι τοίνυν· καὶ σύ, παῖ, κόμιζέ με.
Yes, let him take you: while here, you are a hindrance, a source of trouble. When you have gone, you will vex me no more.	κομιζέτω δῆθʼ· ὡς παρὼν σύ γʼ ἐμποδὼν ὀχλεῖς, συθείς τʼ ἂν οὐκ ἂν ἀλγύνοις πλέον.
I will go when I have performed the errand for which I came, fearless of your frown: you can never destroy me. I tell you: the man whom you have been seeking this long while,	εἰπὼν ἄπειμʼ ὧν οὕνεκʼ, ἦλθον, οὐ τὸ σὸν δείσας πρόσωπον· οὐ γὰρ ἔσθʼ ὅπου μʼ ὀλεῖς. λέγω δέ σοι· τὸν ἄνδρα τοῦτον, ὃν πάλαι
uttering threats and proclaiming a search into the murder of Laius, is here, ostensibly an alien sojourner, but soon to be found a native of Thebes ; nor will he enjoy his fortune. A blind man, though now he sees,	ζητεῖς ἀπειλῶν κἀνακηρύσσων φόνον τὸν Λαΐειον, οὗτός ἐστιν ἐνθάδε, ξένος λόγῳ μέτοικος, εἶτα δʼ ἐγγενὴς φανήσεται Θηβαῖος, οὐδʼ ἡσθήσεται τῇ ξυμφορᾷ· τυφλὸς γὰρ ἐκ δεδορκότος
a beggar, though now rich, he will make his way to a foreign land, feeling the ground before him with his staff. And he will be discovered to be at once brother and father of the children with whom he consorts; son and husband of the woman who bore him;	καὶ πτωχὸς ἀντὶ πλουσίου ξένην ἔπι σκήπτρῳ προδεικνὺς γαῖαν ἐμπορεύσεται. φανήσεται δὲ παισὶ τοῖς αὑτοῦ ξυνὼν ἀδελφὸς αὑτὸς καὶ πατήρ, κἀξ ἧς ἔφυ γυναικὸς υἱὸς καὶ πόσις, καὶ τοῦ πατρὸς
heir to his father’s bed, shedder of his father’s blood. So go in and evaluate this, and if you find that I am wrong, say then that I have no wit in prophecy.	ὁμόσπορός τε καὶ φονεύς. καὶ ταῦτʼ ἰὼν εἴσω λογίζου· κἂν λάβῃς ἐψευσμένον, φάσκειν ἔμʼ ἤδη μαντικῇ μηδὲν φρονεῖν.
Who is he of whom the divine voice from the Delphian rock has said	τίς ὅντινʼ ἁ θεσπιέπεια Δελφὶς εἶπε πέτρα
to have wrought with blood-red hands horrors that no tongue can tell? It is time that he ply in flight a foot stronger than the feet of storm-swift steeds.	ἄρρητʼ ἀρρήτων τελέσαντα φοινίαισι χερσίν; ὥρα νιν ἀελλάδων ἵππων σθεναρώτερον φυγᾷ πόδα νωμᾶν. ἔνοπλος γὰρ ἐπʼ αὐτὸν ἐπενθρῴσκει
The son of Zeus is springing upon him with fiery lightning, and with him come the dread unerring Fates.	πυρὶ καὶ στεροπαῖς ὁ Διὸς γενέτας, δειναὶ δʼ ἅμʼ ἕπονται κῆρες ἀναπλάκητοι
Recently the message has flashed forth from snowy Parnassus	ἔλαμψε γὰρ τοῦ νιφόεντος ἀρτίως φανεῖσα φάμα Παρνασοῦ τὸν ἄδηλον ἄνδρα πάντʼ ἰχνεύειν.
ordering all to search for the unknown man. He wanders under cover of the wild wood, among caves and rocks, fierce as a bull, wretched and forlorn on his joyless path, still seeking to separate himself from the doom revealed at the central shrine of the earth.	φοιτᾷ γὰρ ὑπʼ ἀγρίαν ὕλαν ἀνά τʼ ἄντρα καὶ πέτρας ἰσόταυρος μέλεος μελέῳ ποδὶ χηρεύων,
But that doom lives forever, forever flits around him.	τὰ μεσόμφαλα γᾶς ἀπονοσφίζων μαντεῖα· τὰ δʼ ἀεὶ ζῶντα περιποτᾶται.
The wise augur moves me, neither approving nor denying, with dread, with dread indeed.	δεινὰ μὲν οὖν, δεινὰ ταράσσει σοφὸς οἰωνοθέτας
I am at a loss what to say. I am flustered in my expectations, seeing neither the present nor the future clearly. Never in past days or in these have I heard how the house of Labdacus or the son of Polybus had any quarrel with one another that	οὔτε δοκοῦντʼ οὔτʼ ἀποφάσκονθʼ· ὅ τι λέξω δʼ ἀπορῶ. πέτομαι δʼ ἐλπίσιν οὔτʼ, ἐνθάδʼ ὁρῶν οὔτʼ ὀπίσω. τί γὰρ ἢ Λαβδακίδαις
I could bring as proof in assailing the public reputation of Oedipus, seeking to avenge the line of Labdacus	ἢ τῷ Πολύβου νεῖκος ἔκειτʼ, οὔτε πάροιθέν ποτʼ ἔγωγʼ ἔμαθον, πρὸς ὅτου δὴ βασανίζων βασάνῳ ἐπὶ τὰν ἐπίδαμον φάτιν εἶμʼ Οἰδιπόδα Λαβδακίδαις
for the undiscovered murder.	ἐπίκουρος ἀδήλων θανάτων.
Zeus and Apollo indeed are keen of thought and know the affairs of the earth.	ἀλλʼ ὁ μὲν οὖν Ζεὺς ὅ τʼ Ἀπόλλων ξυνετοὶ καὶ τὰ βροτῶν
But there is no sure test of whether a mortal seer attains more knowledge than I do, though man may surpass man in wisdom. But until I see the word made good, I will never assent when men blame Oedipus. Before all eyes the winged maiden came against him once upon a time, and he was seen to be wise,	εἰδότες· ἀνδρῶν δʼ ὅτι μάντις πλέον ἢ ʼγὼ φέρεται, κρίσις οὔκ ἔστιν ἀλαθής· σοφίᾳ δʼ ἂν σοφίαν παραμείψειεν ἀνήρ. ἀλλʼ οὔποτʼ ἔγωγʼ ἄν, πρὶν ἴδοιμʼ ὀρθὸν ἔπος, μεμφομένων ἂν καταφαίην. φανερὰ γὰρ ἐπʼ αὐτῷ, πτερόεσσʼ ἦλθε κόρα
and bore the test in welcome service to the state. Never, therefore, will he be adjudged guilty of evil.	ποτέ, καὶ σοφὸς ὤφθη βασάνῳ θʼ ἁδύπολις τῷ ἀπʼ ἐμᾶς φρενὸς οὔποτʼ ὀφλήσει κακίαν.
Fellow citizens, having learned that Oedipus the king lays dire charges against me, I have come in indignation.	ἄνδρες πολῖται, δείνʼ ἔπη πεπυσμένος κατηγορεῖν μου τὸν τύραννον Οἰδίπουν,
If he thinks that in the present troubles he has suffered from me, by word or by deed, anything harmful, truly I do not desire my full term of years, when I must bear such blame as this. The wrong of this rumor	πάρειμʼ ἀτλητῶν. εἰ γὰρ ἐν ταῖς ξυμφοραῖς ταῖς νῦν νομίζει πρός γʼ ἐμοῦ πεπονθέναι λόγοισιν εἴτʼ ἔργοισιν εἰς βλάβην φέρον, οὔτοι βίου μοι τοῦ μακραίωνος πόθος, φέροντι τήνδε βάξιν. οὐ γὰρ εἰς ἁπλοῦν
touches me not in one point alone, but has the largest scope, if I am to be called a traitor in the city, a traitor by you and by my friends.	ἡ ζημία μοι τοῦ λόγου τούτου φέρει, ἀλλʼ ἐς μέγιστον, εἰ κακὸς μὲν ἐν πόλει, κακὸς δὲ πρὸς σοῦ καὶ φίλων κεκλήσομαι.
But perhaps this taunt came under the stress of anger, rather than from the purpose of his heart.	ἀλλʼ ἦλθε μὲν δὴ τοῦτο τοὔνειδος τάχʼ ἂν ὀργῇ βιασθὲν μᾶλλον ἢ γνώμῃ φρενῶν.
Was the opinion given that my counsels had brought the seer to utter his falsehoods?	τοὔπος δʼ ἐφάνθη, ταῖς ἐμαῖς γνώμαις ὅτι πεισθεὶς ὁ μάντις τοὺς λόγους ψευδεῖς λέγοι;
Such things were said—I do not know with what meaning.	ηὐδᾶτο μὲν τάδʼ, οἶδα δʼ οὐ γνώμῃ τίνι. ἐξ ὀμμάτων δʼ ὀρθῶν τε κἀξ ὀρθῆς φρενὸς
And was this charge laid against me with steady eyes and steady mind?	κατηγορεῖτο τοὐπίκλημα τοῦτό μου;
I do not know. I see not what my masters do. But here comes our lord from the house.	οὐκ οἶδʼ· ἃ γὰρ δρῶσʼ, οἱ κρατοῦντες οὐχ ὁρῶ. αὐτὸς δʼ ὅδʼ ἤδη δωμάτων ἔξω περᾷ.
You, how did you get here? Are you so boldfaced that you have come to my house, you who are manifestly the murderer of its master,	οὗτος σύ, πῶς δεῦρʼ ἦλθες; ἦ τοσόνδʼ ἔχεις τόλμης πρόσωπον ὥστε τὰς ἐμὰς στέγας ἵκου, φονεὺς ὢν τοῦδε τἀνδρὸς ἐμφανῶς
the palpable thief of its crown? Come, tell me, in the name of the gods, was it cowardice or folly which you saw in me and which led you to plot this thing? Did you think that I would not notice this deed of yours creeping upon me by stealth, or that if I became aware of it I would not ward it off?	λῃστής τʼ ἐναργὴς τῆς ἐμῆς τυραννίδος; φέρʼ εἰπὲ πρὸς θεῶν, δειλίαν ἢ μωρίαν ἰδών τινʼ ἔν μοι ταῦτʼ ἐβουλεύσω ποεῖν; ἢ τοὔργον ὡς οὐ γνωριοῖμί σου τόδε δόλῳ προσέρπον ἢ οὐκ ἀλεξοίμην μαθών;
Is your attempt not foolish, to seek the throne without followers or friends—a prize which followers and wealth must win?	ἆρʼ οὐχὶ μῶρόν ἐστι τοὐγχείρημά σου, ἄνευ τε πλήθους καὶ φίλων τυραννίδα θηρᾶν, ὃ πλήθει χρήμασίν θʼ ἁλίσκεται;
Mark me now: hear a fair reply in answer to your words, and then judge for yourself on the basis of knowledge.	οἶσθʼ ὡς πόησον; ἀντὶ τῶν εἰρημένων ἴσʼ ἀντάκουσον, κᾆτα κρῖνʼ αὐτὸς μαθών.
You are apt in speech, but I have a poor wit for lessons, since I have found you a malignant foe.	λέγειν σὺ δεινός, μανθάνειν δʼ ἐγὼ κακὸς σοῦ· δυσμενῆ γὰρ καὶ βαρύν σʼ ηὕρηκʼ ἐμοί.
Now hear first how I will explain this very thing.	τοῦτʼ αὐτὸ νῦν μου πρῶτʼ ἄκουσον ὡς ἐρῶ.
One thing—that you are not false—do not bother to explain to me.	τοῦτʼ αὐτὸ μή μοι φράζʼ, ὅπως οὐκ εἶ κακός.
If you think that stubbornness	εἴ τοι νομίζεις κτῆμα τὴν αὐθαδίαν
without sense is a virtue, you are not wise.	εἶναί τι τοῦ νοῦ χωρίς, οὐκ ὀρθῶς φρονεῖς.
If you think you can wrong a kinsman and escape the penalty, you are not sane.	εἴ τοι νομίζεις ἄνδρα συγγενῆ κακῶς δρῶν οὐχ ὑφέξειν τὴν δίκην, οὐκ εὖ φρονεῖς.
Justly said, I grant you: but tell me what the wrong is that you say you are suffering at my hands.	ξύμφημί σοι ταῦτʼ ἔνδικʼ εἰρῆσθαι· τὸ δὲ πάθημʼ ὁποῖον φὴς παθεῖν, δίδασκέ με.
Did you, or did you not, advise me to send for that reverend seer?	ἔπειθες ἢ οὐκ ἔπειθες, ὡς χρείη μʼ ἐπὶ τὸν σεμνόμαντιν ἄνδρα πέμψασθαί τινα;
Even now I am of the same mind.	καὶ νῦν ἔθʼ αὑτός εἰμι τῷ βουλεύματι.
How long is it, then, since Laius . . .	πόσον τινʼ ἤδη δῆθʼ ὁ Λάϊος χρόνον
Did what? I do not understand.	δέδρακε ποῖον ἔργον; οὐ γὰρ ἐννοῶ.
was swept out of sight by deadly violence?	ἄφαντος ἔρρει θανασίμῳ χειρώματι;
The count of years would run far into the past.	μακροὶ παλαιοί τʼ ἂν μετρηθεῖεν χρόνοι.
Did this seer possess this skill in those days?	τότʼ οὖν ὁ μάντις οὗτος ἦν ἐν τῇ τέχνῃ;
He was wise as now, and held in equal honor.	σοφός γʼ ὁμοίως κἀξ ἴσου τιμώμενος.
Did he make mention of me at that time?	ἐμνήσατʼ οὖν ἐμοῦ τι τῷ τότʼ ἐν χρόνῳ;
Never, certainly, when I was within hearing.	οὔκουν ἐμοῦ γʼ ἑστῶτος οὐδαμοῦ πέλας.
Did you never investigate the murder?	ἀλλʼ οὐκ ἔρευναν τοῦ κτανόντος ἔσχετε;
Due search we made, of course, though we learned nothing.	παρέσχομεν, πῶς δʼ οὐχί; κοὐκ ἠκούσαμεν.
And how was it that this sage did not tell this story then.	πῶς οὖν τόθʼ οὗτος ὁ σοφὸς οὐκ ηὔδα τάδε;
I do not know: where I lack insight it is my custom to be silent.	οὐκ οἶδʼ· ἐφʼ οἷς γὰρ μὴ φρονῶ σιγᾶν φιλῶ.
This much, at least, you know, and could declare with insight enough.	τοσόνδε γʼ οἶσθα καὶ λέγοις ἂν εὖ φρονῶν.
What is that? If I know it, I will not deny it.	ποῖον τόδʼ; εἰ γὰρ οἶδά γʼ, οὐκ ἀρνήσομαι.
That, if he had not conferred with you, he would not have named me as Laius’ slayer.	ὁθούνεκʼ, εἰ μὴ σοὶ ξυνῆλθε, τάσδʼ ἐμὰς οὐκ ἄν ποτʼ εἶπε Λαΐου διαφθοράς.
If he says this, you know best: but I deem it just	εἰ μὲν λέγει τάδʼ, αὐτὸς οἶσθʼ· ἐγὼ δὲ σοῦ
to learn from you as much as you have from me now.	μαθεῖν δικαιῶ ταὔθʼ ἅπερ κἀμοῦ σὺ νῦν.
Learn your fill. I will never be found guilty of the bloodshed.	ἐκμάνθανʼ· οὐ γὰρ δὴ φονεὺς ἁλώσομαι.
Say, then—have you married my sister?	τί δῆτʼ; ἀδελφὴν τὴν ἐμὴν γήμας ἔχεις;
The question allows no denial.	ἄρνησις οὐκ ἔνεστιν ὧν ἀνιστορεῖς.
And you rule the land as she does, with equal sway.	ἄρχεις δʼ ἐκείνῃ ταὐτὰ γῆς ἴσον νέμων;
She obtains from me all that she wishes.	ἃν ᾖ θέλουσα πάντʼ ἐμοῦ κομίζεται.
And do I not rank as a third peer of you two?	οὔκουν ἰσοῦμαι σφῷν ἐγὼ δυοῖν τρίτος;
It is just in this that you are seen to be a false friend.	ἐνταῦθα γὰρ δὴ καὶ κακὸς φαίνει φίλος.
Not so, if you would reason with your heart as I do with mine. Weigh this first—whether you think that anyone would	οὔκ, εἰ διδοίης γʼ ὡς ἐγὼ σαυτῷ λόγον. σκέψαι δὲ τοῦτο πρῶτον, εἴ τινʼ ἂν δοκεῖς
choose to rule amid terrors rather than in unruffled peace, granted that he is to have the same powers. Now I, for one, have by nature no yearning to rule as a king rather than to do kingly deeds, and neither does any man I know who has a sound mind.	ἄρχειν ἑλέσθαι ξὺν φόβοισι μᾶλλον ἢ ἄτρεστον εὕδοντʼ, εἰ τά γʼ αὔθʼ ἕξει κράτη. ἐγὼ μὲν οὖν οὔτʼ αὐτὸς ἱμείρων ἔφυν τύραννος εἶναι μᾶλλον ἢ τύραννα δρᾶν, οὔτʼ ἄλλος ὅστις σωφρονεῖν ἐπίσταται.
For now I attain all everything from you without fear, but, if I were ruler myself, I would have to do much that went against my own pleasure. How, then, could royalty be sweeter to me to have than painless rule and influence? I am not yet so misguided	νῦν μὲν γὰρ ἐκ σοῦ πάντʼ ἄνευ φόβου φέρω, εἰ δʼ αὐτὸς ἦρχον, πολλὰ κἂν ἄκων ἔδρων. πῶς δῆτʼ ἐμοὶ τυραννὶς ἡδίων ἔχειν ἀρχῆς ἀλύπου καὶ δυναστείας ἔφυ; οὔπω τοσοῦτον ἠπατημένος κυρῶ
that I desire other honors than those which bring profit. Now, every man has a greeting for me; now, all that have a request of you crave to speak with me, since in me lies all their hope of success. Why then should I give up these things and take those others?	ὥστʼ ἄλλα χρῄζειν ἢ τὰ σὺν κέρδει καλά. νῦν πᾶσι χαίρω, νῦν με πᾶς ἀσπάζεται, νῦν οἱ σέθεν χρῄζοντες ἐκκαλοῦσί με· τὸ γὰρ τυχεῖν αὐτοῖσι πᾶν ἐνταῦθʼ ἔνι. πῶς δῆτʼ ἐγὼ κεῖνʼ ἂν λάβοιμʼ ἀφεὶς τάδε;
No mind will become false while it is wise. No, I am no lover of such a policy, and if another put it into action, I could never bear to go along with him. And, in proof of this, first go to Pytho , and ask whether I brought a true report of the oracle.	οὐκ ἂν γένοιτο νοῦς κακὸς καλῶς φρονῶν. ἀλλʼ οὔτʼ ἐραστὴς τῆσδε τῆς γνώμης ἔφυν οὔτʼ ἂν μετʼ ἄλλου δρῶντος ἂν τλαίην ποτέ. καὶ τῶνδʼ ἔλεγχον τοῦτο μὲν Πυθώδʼ ἰὼν πεύθου τὰ χρησθέντʼ εἰ σαφῶς ἤγγειλά σοι·
Then next, if you have found that I have planned anything in concert with the soothsayer, take and slay me, by the sentence not of one mouth, but of two—by my own no less than yours. But do not assume my guilt on unproven inference. It is not just to judge bad men good at random,	τοῦτʼ ἄλλʼ, ἐάν με τῷ τερασκόπῳ λάβῃς κοινῇ τι βουλεύσαντα, μή μʼ ἁπλῇ κτάνῃς ψήφῳ, διπλῇ δέ, τῇ τʼ ἐμῇ καὶ σῇ, λαβών· γνώμῃ δʼ ἀδήλῳ μή με χωρὶς αἰτιῶ. οὐ γὰρ δίκαιον οὔτε τοὺς κακοὺς μάτην
or good men bad. I think that casting off a true friend is for a man like casting away the life in his own bosom, which he most loves. You will surely learn about these affairs in time, since time alone reveals a just man.	χρηστοὺς νομίζειν οὔτε τοὺς χρηστοὺς κακούς. φίλον γὰρ ἐσθλὸν ἐκβαλεῖν ἴσον λέγω καὶ τὸν παρʼ αὑτῷ βίοτον, ὃν πλεῖστον, φιλεῖ. ἀλλʼ ἐν χρόνῳ γνώσει τάδʼ ἀσφαλῶς, ἐπεὶ χρόνος δίκαιον ἄνδρα δείκνυσιν μόνος·
But you can discern a bad man even in one day alone.	κακὸν δὲ κἂν ἐν ἡμέρᾳ γνοίης μιᾷ.
He has spoken well, my king, for one who is taking care not to fall: those who are quick in counsel are not sure.	καλῶς ἔλεξεν εὐλαβουμένῳ πεσεῖν, ἄναξ· φρονεῖν γὰρ οἱ ταχεῖς οὐκ ἀσφαλεῖς.
When the stealthy plotter is moving on me quickly, I, too, must be quick in my counterplot.	ὅταν ταχύς τις οὑπιβουλεύων λάθρᾳ χωρῇ, ταχὺν δεῖ κἀμὲ βουλεύειν πάλιν·
If I await him in repose, his ends will have been gained, and mine lost.	εἰ δʼ ἡσυχάζων προσμενῶ, τὰ τοῦδε μὲν πεπραγμένʼ ἔσται, τἀμὰ δʼ ἡμαρτημένα.
What do you want then? To banish me from the land?	τί δῆτα χρῄζεις; ἦ με γῆς ἔξω βαλεῖν;
Hardly. I desire your death, not your exile, so that I might show what a thing envy is.	ἥκιστα· θνῄσκειν, οὐ φυγεῖν σε βούλομαι. ὡς ἂν προδείξῃς οἷόν ἐστι τὸ φθονεῖν.
Are you resolved not to yield or believe?	ὡς οὐχ ὑπείξων οὐδὲ πιστεύσων λέγεις;
No, for I see you are not sane.	οὐ γὰρ φρονοῦντά σʼ εὖ βλέπω.
Sane, at least, in my own interest.	τὸ γοῦν ἐμόν.
But you should be so in mine also.	ἀλλʼ ἐξ ἴσου δεῖ κἀμόν.
You are false.	ἀλλʼ ἔφυς κακός.
But if you understand nothing?	εἰ δὲ ξυνίης μηδέν;
Still I must rule.	ἀρκτέον γʼ ὅμως.
Not if you rule badly.	οὔτοι κακῶς γʼ ἄρχοντος.
Hear him, city of Thebes !	ὦ πόλις πόλις.
The city is mine too, not yours alone.	κἀμοὶ πόλεως μέτεστιν, οὐχί σοι μόνῳ.
Cease, lords. In good time I see Iocasta coming from the house, with whose help you should resolve your present feud.	παύσασθʼ, ἄνακτες· καιρίαν δʼ ὑμῖν ὁρῶ τήνδʼ ἐκ δόμων στείχουσαν Ἰοκάστην, μεθʼ ἧς τὸ νῦν παρεστὸς νεῖκος εὖ θέσθαι χρεών.
Misguided men, why have you raised	τί τὴν ἄβουλον, ὦ ταλαίπωροι, στάσιν
such a foolish argument? Are you not ashamed, while the land is so sick, to stir up troubles of your own? Come, go into the house—and you, Creon, go to yours—and stop making so much of a petty grief.	γλώσσης ἐπήρασθʼ οὐδʼ ἐπαισχύνεσθε γῆς οὕτω νοσούσης ἴδια κινοῦντες κακά; οὐκ εἶ σύ τʼ οἴκους σύ τε, Κρέων, κατὰ στέγας, καὶ μὴ τὸ μηδὲν ἄλγος εἰς μέγʼ οἴσετε;
Kinswoman, Oedipus, your husband,	ὅμαιμε, δεινά μʼ Οἰδίπους ὁ σὸς πόσις
wants to do one of two terrible things to me, either to thrust me from the land of my fathers or to arrest and slay me.	δρᾶσαι δικαιοῖ δυοῖν ἀποκρίνας κακοῖν ἢ γῆς ἀπῶσαι πατρίδος ἢ κτεῖναι λαβών.
Yes indeed, for I have caught him, lady, working evil against my person with his wicked craft.	ξύμφημι· δρῶντα γάρ νιν, ὦ γύναι, κακῶς εἴληφα τοὐμὸν σῶμα σὺν τέχνῃ κακῇ.
May I derive no benefit,	μή νυν ὀναίμην, ἀλλʼ ἀραῖος, εἴ σέ τι
but perish accursed, if I have done any of the things of which you charge me.	δέδρακʼ, ὀλοίμην, ὧν ἐπαιτιᾷ με δρᾶν.
In the name of the gods, believe it, Oedipus, first for the sake of this awful oath to the gods, then for my sake and for the sake of those who stand before you.	ὦ πρὸς θεῶν πίστευσον, Οἰδίπους, τάδε, μάλιστα μὲν τόνδʼ ὅρκον αἰδεσθεὶς θεῶν, ἔπειτα κἀμὲ τούσδε θʼ οἳ πάρεισί σοι.
Consent, reflect, listen, my king, I beg you.	πιθοῦ θελήσας φρονήσας τʼ, ἄναξ, λίσσομαι.
What would you have me grant you?	τί σοι θέλεις δῆτʼ εἰκάθω;
Respect him who was in the past not foolish, and who now is strong in his oath.	τὸν οὔτε πρὶν νήπιον νῦν τʼ ἐν ὅρκῳ μέγαν καταίδεσαι. οἶσθʼ οὖν ἃ χρῄζεις;
Do you understand what you crave?	οἶδα.
I do.	φράζε δὴ τί φής.
Tell me, then, what you mean.	τὸν ἐναγῆ φίλον μήποτʼ ἐν αἰτίᾳ
That you should never use an unproved rumor to cast a dishonoring charge on the friend who has bound himself with a curse.	σὺν ἀφανεῖ λόγῳ σʼ ἄτιμον βαλεῖν. εὖ νυν ἐπίστω, ταῦθʼ ὅταν ζητῇς, ἐμοὶ
Then be quite aware that when you seek this you are seeking death or exile from this land for me.	ζητῶν ὄλεθρον ἢ φυγὴν ἐκ τῆσδε γῆς.
No, by the god that stands at the head of all the host of the gods, no, by the sun. Unblest, unbefriended, may I die the worst possible death, if I have this thought!	οὐ τὸν πάντων θεῶν θεὸν πρόμον Ἅλιον· ἐπεὶ ἄθεος ἄφιλος ὅ τι πύματον ὀλοίμαν, φρόνησιν εἰ τάνδʼ ἔχω.
But my unhappy soul is worn by the withering of the land, as well as by the thought that our old sorrows should be crowned by new ones arising from the two of you. Then let him go, though I am surely doomed to be killed	ἀλλά μοι δυσμόρῳ γᾶ φθινὰς τρύχει ψυχάν, τάδʼ εἰ κακοῖς κακὰ προσάψει τοῖς πάλαι τὰ πρὸς σφῷν. ὁ δʼ οὖν ἴτω, κεἰ χρή με παντελῶς θανεῖν
or thrust dishonored from the land. Your words, not his, move me to compassion; but he, wherever he be, shall be hated.	ἢ γῆς ἄτιμον τῆσδʼ ἀπωσθῆναι βίᾳ. τὸ γὰρ σόν, οὐ τὸ τοῦδʼ, ἐποικτίρω στόμα ἐλεινόν· οὗτος δʼ ἔνθʼ ἂν ᾖ στυγήσεται.
You are truly sullen in yielding, as you are vehement in the excesses of your wrath. But such natures are	στυγνὸς μὲν εἴκων δῆλος εἶ, βαρὺς δʼ, ὅταν θυμοῦ περάσῃς· αἱ δὲ τοιαῦται φύσεις
justly most difficult for themselves to bear.	αὑταῖς δικαίως εἰσὶν ἄλγισται φέρειν.
Will you not be gone and leave me in peace? I will go on my way. I have found you undiscerning, but in the view of these men I am just.	οὔκουν μʼ ἐάσεις κἀκτὸς εἶ; πορεύσομαι,
Lady, why do you hesitate to take this man into the house?	γύναι, τί μέλλεις κομίζειν δόμων τόνδʼ ἔσω;
I will, when I have learned what has happened.	μαθοῦσά γʼ ἥτις ἡ τύχη.
Blind suspicion, bred of talk, arose, and injustice inflicts wounds.	δόκησις ἀγνὼς λόγων ἦλθε, δάπτει δὲ καὶ τὸ μὴ ʼνʼδικον.
On both sides?	ἀμφοῖν ἀπʼ αὐτοῖν;
Yes.	ναίχι.
And what was the story?	καὶ τίς ἦν λόγος;
It is enough, I think, enough, when our land is already vexed, that the matter should rest where it stopped.	ἅλις ἔμοιγʼ, ἅλις, γᾶς προπονουμένας, φαίνεται ἔνθʼ ἔληξεν αὐτοῦ μένειν.
Do you see to what you have come, for all your noble intent, in seeking to slacken and blunt my zeal?	ὁρᾷς ἵνʼ ἥκεις, ἀγαθὸς ὢν γνώμην ἀνήρ, τοὐμὸν παριεὶς καὶ καταμβλύνων κέαρ;
be sure that I would have proved myself a madman, bankrupt in sane counsel, if I forsook you—you, who gave a true course to my beloved country when it was	ὦναξ, εἶπον μὲν οὐχ ἅπαξ μόνον, ἴσθι δὲ παραφρόνιμον, ἄπορον ἐπὶ φρόνιμα πεφάνθαι μʼ ἄν, εἴ σʼ ἐνοσφιζόμαν, ὅς τʼ ἐμὰν γᾶν φίλαν ἐν πόνοις
distraught with troubles, and who now are likely to prove our prospering guide.	ἀλύουσαν κατʼ ὀρθὸν οὔρισας, τανῦν τʼ εὔπομπος, ἂν γένοιο. πρὸς θεῶν δίδαξον κἄμʼ, ἄναξ, ὅτου ποτὲ
In the name of the gods, tell me, king, the reason that you have conceived this steadfast wrath.	μῆνιν τοσήνδε πράγματος στήσας ἔχεις.
That I will do, for I honor you, lady, above these men. Creon is the cause, and the plots he has laid against me.	ἐρῶ· σὲ γὰρ τῶνδʼ ἐς πλέον, γύναι, σέβω· Κρέοντος, οἷά μοι βεβουλευκὼς ἔχει.
Come, tell me how the argument began.	λέγʼ, εἰ σαφῶς τὸ νεῖκος ἐγκαλῶν ἐρεῖς.
He says that I stand guilty of Laius’ blood.	φονέα με φησὶ Λαΐου καθεστάναι.
On his own knowledge or on hearsay from another?	αὐτὸς ξυνειδὼς ἢ μαθὼν ἄλλου πάρα;
He has made a rascal seer his mouth piece: as for himself, he keeps his lips wholly pure.	μάντιν μὲν οὖν κακοῦργον εἰσπέμψας, ἐπεὶ τό γʼ εἰς ἑαυτὸν πᾶν ἐλευθεροῖ στόμα.
Then absolve yourself of the things about which you are speaking. Listen to me, and take comfort in learning that nothing of mortal birth shares in the science of the seer.	σύ νυν ἀφεὶς σεαυτὸν ὧν λέγεις πέρι ἐμοῦ ʼπάκουσον, καὶ μάθʼ οὕνεκʼ ἐστί σοι βρότειον οὐδὲν μαντικῆς ἔχον τέχνης.
I will give you a pithy proof of this. An oracle came to Laius once—I will not say from Phoebus himself, but from his ministers—saying that he would suffer his doom at the hands of the child to be born to him and me.	φανῶ δέ σοι σημεῖα τῶνδε σύντομα. χρησμὸς γὰρ ἦλθε Λαΐῳ ποτʼ, οὐκ ἐρῶ Φοίβου γʼ ἄπʼ αὐτοῦ, τῶν δʼ ὑπηρετῶν ἄπο, ὡς αὐτὸν ἕξοι μοῖρα πρὸς παιδὸς θανεῖν, ὅστις γένοιτʼ ἐμοῦ τε κἀκείνου πάρα.
And Laius—as, at least, the rumor goes—was murdered one day by foreign robbers at a place where the three highways meet. And the child’s birth was not yet three days past, when Laius pinned his ankles together and had him thrown, by others’ hands, on a remote mountain.	καὶ τὸν μέν, ὥσπερ γʼ ἡ φάτις, ξένοι ποτὲ λῃσταὶ φονεύουσʼ ἐν τριπλαῖς ἁμαξιτοῖς· παιδὸς δὲ βλάστας οὐ διέσχον ἡμέραι τρεῖς, καί νιν ἄρθρα κεῖνος ἐνζεύξας ποδοῖν ἔρριψεν ἄλλων χερσὶν ἄβατον εἰς ὄρος.
So, in that case, Apollo did not bring it to pass that the child should become the slayer of his father, or that Laius should suffer that which he feared, death at the hands of his child: thus the messages of the seer’s art had mapped out the future. Pay them no regard. Whatever necessary event	κἀνταῦθʼ Ἀπόλλων οὔτʼ ἐκεῖνον ἤνυσεν φονέα γενέσθαι πατρὸς οὔτε Λάϊον τὸ δεινὸν οὑφοβεῖτο πρὸς παιδὸς θανεῖν. τοιαῦτα φῆμαι μαντικαὶ διώρισαν, ὧν ἐντρέπου σὺ μηδέν· ὧν γὰρ ἂν θεὸς
the god seeks, he himself will easily bring to light.	χρείαν ἐρευνᾷ, ῥᾳδίως αὐτὸς φανεῖ.
What restlessness of soul, lady, what tumult has come upon me since I heard you speak!	οἷόν μʼ ἀκούσαντʼ ἀρτίως ἔχει, γύναι, ψυχῆς πλάνημα κἀνακίνησις φρενῶν.
What anxiety has startled you, that you say this?	ποίας μερίμνης τοῦθʼ ὑποστραφεὶς λέγεις;
I thought that I heard this from you—that Laius	ἔδοξʼ ἀκοῦσαι σοῦ τόδʼ, ὡς ὁ Λάϊος
was slain where the three roads meet.	κατασφαγείη πρὸς τριπλαῖς ἁμαξιτοῖς.
Yes, that was the report, and so it is still thought.	ηὐδᾶτο γὰρ ταῦτʼ οὐδέ πω λήξαντʼ ἔχει.
And where is the place where this occurred?	καὶ ποῦ ʼσθʼ ὁ χῶρος οὗτος οὗ τόδʼ ἦν πάθος;
The land is called Phocis ; the branching forks lead to the same spot from Delphi and from Daulia.	Φωκὶς μὲν ἡ γῆ κλῄζεται, σχιστὴ δʼ ὁδὸς ἐς ταὐτὸ Δελφῶν κἀπὸ Δαυλίας ἄγει.
And how much time has passed since these events took place?	καὶ τίς χρόνος τοῖσδʼ ἐστὶν οὑξεληλυθώς;
The news was announced to the town shortly before you first attained power over this land.	σχεδόν τι πρόσθεν ἢ σὺ τῆσδʼ ἔχων χθονὸς ἀρχὴν ἐφαίνου, τοῦτʼ ἐκηρύχθη πόλει.
O Zeus, what have you decreed for me?	ὦ Ζεῦ, τί μου δρᾶσαι βεβούλευσαι πέρι;
Why, Oedipus, does this matter weigh upon your heart?	τί δʼ ἐστί σοι τοῦτʼ, Οἰδίπους, ἐνθύμιον;
Do not ask me yet. Tell me rather what stature Laius had, and how ripe his manhood was.	μήπω μʼ ἐρώτα· τὸν δὲ Λάϊον φύσιν τίνʼ ἦλθε φράζε, τίνα δʼ ἀκμὴν ἥβης ἔχων.
He was tall—the silver just lightly strewn among his hair—and his form was not greatly unlike your own.	μέγας, χνοάζων ἄρτι λευκανθὲς κάρα, μορφῆς δὲ τῆς σῆς οὐκ ἀπεστάτει πολύ.
Unhappy that I am! I think that I have	οἴμοι τάλας· ἔοικʼ ἐμαυτὸν εἰς ἀρὰς
laid myself under a terrible curse without realizing it.	δεινὰς προβάλλων ἀρτίως οὐκ εἰδέναι.
How do you mean? I tremble when I look at you, my lord.	πῶς φῄς; ὀκνῶ τοι πρός σʼ ἀποσκοποῦσʼ, ἄναξ.
I have dread fears that the seer can see. But you will reveal the matter better if you tell me one thing more.	δεινῶς ἀθυμῶ μὴ βλέπων ὁ μάντις ᾖ· δείξεις δὲ μᾶλλον, ἢν ἓν ἐξείπῃς ἔτι.
Indeed, though I tremble, I will hear and answer all that you ask.	καὶ μὴν ὀκνῶ μέν, ἃ δʼ ἂν ἔρῃ μαθοῦσʼ ἐρῶ.
Did he go with a small force, or like a chieftain, with many armed followers?	πότερον ἐχώρει βαιὸς ἢ πολλοὺς ἔχων ἄνδρας λοχίτας, οἷʼ ἀνὴρ ἀρχηγέτης; πέντʼ ἦσαν οἱ ξύμπαντες, ἐν δʼ αὐτοῖσιν ἦν .
Five they were in all—a herald among them—and there was one carriage which bore Laius.	κῆρυξ· ἀπήνη δʼ ἦγε Λάϊον μία. αἰαῖ, τάδʼ ἤδη διαφανῆ. τίς ἦν ποτε
Alas! It is all clear now! Who gave you this information, lady?	ὁ τούσδε λέξας τοὺς λόγους ὑμῖν, γύναι;
A servant, the only survivor who returned home.	οἰκεύς τις, ὅσπερ ἵκετʼ ἐκσωθεὶς μόνος.
Is he by any chance in the house now?	ἦ κἀν δόμοισι τυγχάνει τανῦν παρών;
No. Soon after he returned and found you ruling in Laius’ stead,	οὐ δῆτʼ· ἀφʼ οὗ γὰρ κεῖθεν ἦλθε καὶ κράτη σέ τʼ εἶδʼ ἔχοντα Λάϊόν τʼ ὀλωλότα,
he pled with me, with hand laid on mine, to send him to the fields, to the pastures of the flocks, that he might be far from the sight of this town. And I sent him; he was worthy, for a slave, to win even a larger favor than that.	ἐξικέτευσε τῆς ἐμῆς χειρὸς θιγὼν ἀγρούς σφε πέμψαι κἀπὶ ποιμνίων νομάς, ὡς πλεῖστον εἴη τοῦδʼ ἄποπτος ἄστεως. κἄπεμψʼ ἐγώ νιν· ἄξιος γὰρ οἷʼ ἀνὴρ δοῦλος φέρειν ἦν τῆσδε καὶ μείζω χάριν.
Would, then, that he return to us without delay!	πῶς ἂν μόλοι δῆθʼ ἡμὶν ἐν τάχει πάλιν;
That is easy. But why do you enjoin this?	πάρεστιν· ἀλλὰ πρὸς τί τοῦτʼ ἐφίεσαι;
I fear, lady, that my words have been rash, and therefore I wish to see him.	δέδοικʼ ἐμαυτόν, ὦ γύναι, μὴ πόλλʼ ἄγαν εἰρημένʼ ᾖ μοι διʼ ἅ νιν εἰσιδεῖν θέλω.
He will come. But I think that	ἀλλʼ ἵξεται μέν· ἀξία δέ που μαθεῖν
I too have a claim to learn what lies heavy on your heart, my king.	κἀγὼ τά γʼ ἐν σοὶ δυσφόρως ἔχοντʼ, ἄναξ.
It will not be kept from you, now that my forebodings have advanced so far. To whom more than to you would I speak in suffering such a fortune as this? My father was Polybus of Corinth ,	κοὐ μὴ στερηθῇς γʼ, ἐς τοσοῦτον ἐλπίδων ἐμοῦ βεβῶτος. τῷ γὰρ ἂν καὶ μείζονι λέξαιμʼ ἂν ἢ σοί, διὰ τύχης τοιᾶσδʼ ἰών; ἐμοὶ πατὴρ μὲν Πόλυβος ἦν Κορίνθιος,
my mother the Dorian Merope. I was considered the greatest of the folk in that town, until a chance event befell me, worthy, indeed, of wonder, though not of my overreaction regarding it. At a banquet, a man drunk with wine	μήτηρ δὲ Μερόπη Δωρίς. ἠγόμην δʼ ἀνὴρ ἀστῶν μέγιστος τῶν ἐκεῖ, πρίν μοι τύχη τοιάδʼ ἐπέστη, θαυμάσαι μὲν ἀξία, σπουδῆς γε μέντοι τῆς ἐμῆς οὐκ ἀξία. ἀνὴρ γὰρ ἐν δείπνοις μʼ ὑπερπλησθεὶς μέθῃ
cast it at me that I was not the true son of my father. And I, vexed, restrained myself for that day as best as I could, but on the next went to my mother and father and questioned them. They were angry at the one who had let this taunt fly.	καλεῖ παρʼ οἴνῳ, πλαστὸς ὡς εἴην πατρί. κἀγὼ βαρυνθεὶς τὴν μὲν οὖσαν ἡμέραν μόλις κατέσχον, θἀτέρᾳ δʼ ἰὼν πέλας μητρὸς πατρός τʼ ἤλεγχον· οἱ δὲ δυσφόρως τοὔνειδος ἦγον τῷ μεθέντι τὸν λόγον.
So I had comfort about them, but the matter rankled in my heart, for such a rumor still spread widely. I went to Delphi without my parents’ knowledge, and Phoebus sent me forth disappointed of the knowledge for which I had come,	κἀγὼ τὰ μὲν κείνοιν ἐτερπόμην, ὅμως δʼ ἔκνιζέ μʼ ἀεὶ τοῦθʼ· ὑφεῖρπε γὰρ πολύ. λάθρᾳ δὲ μητρὸς καὶ πατρὸς πορεύομαι Πυθώδε, καί μʼ ὁ Φοῖβος ὧν μὲν ἱκόμην ἄτιμον ἐξέπεμψεν, ἄλλα δʼ ἄθλια
but in his response set forth other things, full of sorrow and terror and woe: that I was fated to defile my mother’s bed, that I would reveal to men a brood which they could not endure to behold, and that I would slay the father that sired me. When I heard this, I turned in flight from the land of Corinth ,	καὶ δεινὰ καὶ δύστηνα προύφηνεν λέγων, ὡς μητρὶ μὲν χρείη με μιχθῆναι, γένος δʼ ἄτλητον ἀνθρώποισι δηλώσοιμʼ ὁρᾶν, φονεὺς δʼ ἐσοίμην τοῦ φυτεύσαντος πατρός. κἀγὼ ʼπακούσας ταῦτα τὴν Κορινθίαν,
from then on thinking of it only by its position under the stars, to some spot where I should never see fulfillment of the infamies foretold in my evil fate. And on my way I came to the land in which you say that this prince perished.	ἄστροις τὸ λοιπὸν ἐκμετρούμενος, χθόνα ἔφευγον, ἔνθα μήποτʼ ὀψοίμην κακῶν χρησμῶν ὀνείδη τῶν ἐμῶν τελούμενα. στείχων δʼ ἱκνοῦμαι τούσδε τοὺς χώρους, ἐν οἷς σὺ τὸν τύραννον τοῦτον ὄλλυσθαι λέγεις.
Now, lady, I will tell you the truth. When on my journey I was near those three roads, there I met a herald, and a man in a carriage drawn by colts, as you have described. The leader and the old man	καί σοι, γύναι, τἀληθὲς ἐξερῶ. τριπλῆς ὅτʼ ἦ κελεύθου τῆσδʼ ὁδοιπορῶν πέλας, ἐνταῦθά μοι κῆρύξ τε κἀπὶ πωλικῆς ἀνὴρ ἀπήνης ἐμβεβώς, οἷον σὺ φῇς, ξυνηντίαζον· κἀξ ὁδοῦ μʼ ὅ θʼ ἡγεμὼν
himself tried to thrust me rudely from the path. Then, in anger, I struck the one pushing me aside, the driver, and the old man, when he saw this, watched for the moment I was passing, and from his carriage, brought his double goad straight down on my head.	αὐτός θʼ ὁ πρέσβυς πρὸς βίαν ἠλαυνέτην. κἀγὼ τὸν ἐκτρέποντα, τὸν τροχηλάτην, παίω διʼ ὀργῆς· καί μʼ ὁ πρέσβυς ὡς ὁρᾷ, ὄχου παραστείχοντα τηρήσας, μέσον κάρα διπλοῖς κέντροισί μου καθίκετο.
Yet he was paid back with interest: with one swift blow from the staff in this hand he rolled right out of the carriage onto his back. I slew every one of them. But if this stranger had any tie of kinship to Laius,	οὐ μὴν ἴσην γʼ ἔτισεν, ἀλλὰ συντόμως σκήπτρῳ τυπεὶς ἐκ τῆσδε χειρὸς ὕπτιος μέσης ἀπήνης εὐθὺς ἐκκυλίνδεται· κτείνω δὲ τοὺς ξύμπαντας. εἰ δὲ τῷ ξένῳ τούτῳ προσήκει Λαΐου τι συγγενές,
who is now more wretched than this man before you? What mortal could be proved more hateful to the gods? No stranger, no citizen, is allowed to receive him at home, it is unlawful for anyone to accost him, and all must push him from their homes. And this—this curse—	τίς τοῦδέ γʼ ἀνδρός ἐστιν ἀθλιώτερος; τίς ἐχθροδαίμων μᾶλλον ἂν γένοιτʼ ἀνήρ; ὃν μὴ ξένων ἔξεστι μηδʼ ἀστῶν τινι δόμοις δέχεσθαι μηδὲ προσφωνεῖν τινα, ὠθεῖν δʼ ἀπʼ οἴκων. καὶ τάδʼ οὔτις ἄλλος ἦν
was laid on me by no other mouth than my own. And I pollute the bed of the slain man with the hands by which he perished. Am I now vile? Oh, am I not utterly unclean, seeing that I must be banished, and in banishment neither see my own people,	ἢ ʼγὼ ʼπʼ ἐμαυτῷ τάσδʼ ἀρὰς ὁ προστιθείς. λέχη δὲ τοῦ θανόντος ἐκ χεροῖν ἐμαῖν χραίνω, διʼ ὧνπερ ὤλετʼ· ἆρʼ ἔφυν κακός; ἆρʼ οὐχὶ πᾶς ἄναγνος; εἴ με χρὴ φυγεῖν, καί μοι φυγόντι μἤστι τοὺς ἐμοὺς ἰδεῖν
nor set foot in my own land, or else be joined in wedlock to my mother, and slay my father Polybus, who sired and reared me? Then would he who judged these things to be sent down by some cruel divinity not be right about Oedipus?	μηδʼ ἐμβατεύειν πατρίδος, ἢ γάμοις με δεῖ μητρὸς ζυγῆναι καὶ πατέρα κατακτανεῖν Πόλυβον, ὃς ἐξέφυσε κἀξέθρεψέ με. ἆρʼ οὐκ ἀπʼ ὠμοῦ ταῦτα δαίμονός τις ἂν κρίνων ἐπʼ ἀνδρὶ τῷδʼ ἂν ὀρθοίη λόγον;
Prevent, prevent, you pure and awful gods, me from ever seeing that day! No, may I be swept away from all men, before I see myself visited with that brand of doom.	μὴ δῆτα, μὴ δῆτʼ, ὦ θεῶν ἁγνὸν σέβας, ἴδοιμι ταύτην ἡμέραν, ἀλλʼ ἐκ βροτῶν βαίην ἄφαντος πρόσθεν ἢ τοιάνδʼ ἰδεῖν κηλῖδʼ ἐμαυτῷ συμφορᾶς ἀφιγμένην.
To us, king, these things are fraught with fear. Yet have hope, until at least you have gained full knowledge	ἡμῖν μέν, ὦναξ, ταῦτʼ ὀκνήρʼ· ἕως δʼ ἂν οὖν
from the one who saw the deed.	πρὸς τοῦ παρόντος ἐκμάθῃς, ἔχʼ ἐλπίδα.
I have, in truth, this much hope alone: I await the man summoned from the pastures.	καὶ μὴν τοσοῦτόν γʼ ἐστί μοι τῆς ἐλπίδος, τὸν ἄνδρα τὸν βοτῆρα προσμεῖναι μόνον.
And what do you want from him when he appears?	πεφασμένου δὲ τίς ποθʼ ἡ προθυμία;
I will tell you. If his story is found	ἐγὼ διδάξω σʼ· ἢν γὰρ εὑρεθῇ λέγων
to match withwith yours, I at least, will stand clear of disaster.	σοὶ ταὔτʼ, ἔγωγʼ ἂν ἐκπεφευγοίην πάθος.
And what special note did you hear from me?	ποῖον δέ μου περισσὸν ἤκουσας λόγον;
You said that he spoke of Laius as slain by robbers. If, then, he still speaks of several as before, I was not the slayer:	λῃστὰς ἔφασκες αὐτὸν ἄνδρας ἐννέπειν ὥς νιν κατακτείνειαν. εἰ μὲν οὖν ἔτι λέξει τὸν αὐτὸν ἀριθμόν, οὐκ ἐγὼ ʼκτανον·
a solitary man could not be considered the same as that band. But if he names one lonely wayfarer, then beyond doubt this guilt rests upon me.	οὐ γὰρ γένοιτʼ ἂν εἷς γε τοῖς πολλοῖς ἴσος· εἰ δʼ ἄνδρʼ ἕνʼ οἰόζωνον αὐδήσει, σαφῶς τοῦτʼ ἐστὶν ἤδη τοὔργον εἰς ἐμὲ ῥέπον.
Be assured that thus, at least, the tale was first told. He cannot revoke that,	ἀλλʼ ὡς φανέν γε τοὔπος ὧδʼ ἐπίστασο, κοὐκ ἔστιν αὐτῷ τοῦτό γʼ ἐκβαλεῖν πάλιν·
for the city heard it, not I alone. But even if he should diverge somewhat from his former story, never, king, can he show that the murder of Laius, at least, is truly square with the prophecy, for Loxias plainly said that he was to die at the hand of my child.	πόλις γὰρ ἤκουσʼ, οὐκ ἐγὼ μόνη, τάδε. εἰ δʼ οὖν τι κἀκτρέποιτο τοῦ πρόσθεν λόγου, οὔτοι ποτʼ, ὦναξ, σόν γε Λαΐου φόνον φανεῖ δικαίως ὀρθόν, ὅν γε Λοξίας διεῖπε χρῆναι παιδὸς ἐξ ἐμοῦ θανεῖν.
How was it then that that poor innocent never slew him, but perished first? From now on then, as far as divination goes, I would not look to my right hand or my left.	καίτοι νιν οὐ κεῖνός γʼ ὁ δύστηνός ποτε κατέκτανʼ, ἀλλʼ αὐτὸς πάροιθεν ὤλετο. ὥστʼ οὐχὶ μαντείας γʼ ἂν οὔτε τῇδʼ ἐγὼ βλέψαιμʼ ἂν εἵνεκʼ οὔτε τῇδʼ ἂν ὕστερον.
You are right. But nevertheless send someone to fetch the peasant,	καλῶς νομίζεις· ἀλλʼ ὅμως τὸν ἐργάτην
and do not neglect this matter.	πέμψον τινὰ στελοῦντα μηδὲ τοῦτʼ ἀφῇς.
I will send for him without delay. But let us go into the house: I will do nothing which does not please you.	πέμψω ταχύνασʼ· ἀλλʼ ἴωμεν ἐς δόμους· οὐδὲν γὰρ ἂν πράξαιμʼ ἂν ὧν οὐ σοὶ φίλον.
May destiny still find me winning the praise of reverent purity in all words and	εἴ μοι ξυνείη φέροντι μοῖρα τὰν εὔσεπτον ἁγνείαν λόγων
deeds sanctioned by those laws of sublime range, called into life through the high clear aether, whose father is Olympus alone. Their parent was no race of mortal men,	ἔργων τε πάντων, ὧν νόμοι πρόκεινται ὑψίποδες, οὐρανίαν διʼ αἰθέρα τεκνωθέντες, ὧν Ὄλυμπος πατὴρ μόνος, οὐδέ νιν θνατὰ φύσις ἀνέρων
no, nor shall oblivion ever lay them to sleep: the god is mighty in them, and he does not grow old.	ἔτικτεν οὐδὲ μή ποτε λάθα κατακοιμάσῃ· μέγας ἐν τούτοις θεὸς οὐδὲ γηράσκει.
Insolence breeds the tyrant. Insolence, once vainly stuffed with wealth	ὕβρις φυτεύει τύραννον· ὕβρις, εἰ πολλῶν ὑπερπλησθῇ μάταν,
that is not proper or good for it, when it has scaled the topmost ramparts, is hurled to a dire doom, where one’s feet cannot serve to good advantage. But I pray that the god never	ἃ μὴ ʼπίκαιρα μηδὲ συμφέροντα, ἀκρότατον εἰσαναβᾶσʼ αἶπος ἀπότομον ὤρουσεν εἰς ἀνάγκαν, ἔνθʼ οὐ ποδὶ χρησίμῳ
quell such rivalry as benefits the state. I will always hold the god as our protector.	χρῆται. τὸ καλῶς δʼ ἔχον πόλει πάλαισμα μήποτε λῦσαι θεὸν αἰτοῦμαι. θεὸν οὐ λήξω ποτὲ προστάταν ἴσχων.
But if any man walks haughtily in deed or word,	εἰ δέ τις ὑπέροπτα χερσὶν ἢ λόγῳ πορεύεται,
with no fear of Justice, no reverence for the images of gods, may an evil doom seize him for his ill-starred pride, if he does not gain his advantage fairly,	δίκας ἀφόβητος οὐδὲ δαιμόνων ἕδη σέβων, κακά νιν ἕλοιτο μοῖρα, δυσπότμου χάριν χλιδᾶς, εἰ μὴ τὸ κέρδος κερδανεῖ δικαίως
or avoid unholy deeds, but seeks to lay profaning hands on sanctities. Where such things occur, what mortal shall boast any more that he can ward off the arrow of the gods from his life?	καὶ τῶν ἀσέπτων ἔρξεται ἢ τῶν ἀθίκτων θίξεται ματᾴζων. τίς ἔτι ποτʼ ἐν τοῖσδʼ ἀνὴρ θεῶν βέλη εὔξεται ψυχᾶς ἀμύνειν;
No. For if such deeds are held in honor, why should we join in the sacred dance?	εἰ γὰρ αἱ τοιαίδε πράξεις τίμιαι, τί δεῖ με χορεύειν;
No longer will I go reverently to the earth’s central and inviolate shrine, no more to Abae’s temple or to Olympia ,	οὐκέτι τὸν ἄθικτον εἶμι γᾶς ἐπʼ ὀμφαλὸν σέβων,
if these oracles do not fit the outcome, so that all mortals shall point at them with their fingers.	οὐδʼ ἐς τὸν Ἀβαῖσι ναὸν οὐδὲ τὰν Ὀλυμπίαν, εἰ μὴ τάδε χειρόδεικτα πᾶσιν ἁρμόσει βροτοῖς. ἀλλʼ, ὦ κρατύνων, εἴπερ ὄρθʼ ἀκούεις,
No, King—if this you are rightly called—Zeus all ruling, may it not escape you and your deathless power! The old prophecies concerning Laius are fading; already men give them no value, and nowhere is Apollo glorified with honors;	Ζεῦ, πάντʼ ἀνάσσων, μὴ λάθοι σὲ τάν τε σὰν ἀθάνατον αἰὲν ἀρχάν. φθίνοντα γὰρ Λαΐου παλαίφατα θέσφατʼ ἐξαιροῦσιν ἤδη, κοὐδαμοῦ τιμαῖς Ἀπόλλων ἐμφανής·
the worship of the gods is perishing.	ἔρρει δὲ τὰ θεῖα.
Princes of the land, I am planning to visit the shrines of the gods, with this wreathed branch and these gifts of incense in my hands. For Oedipus excites his soul excessively with all sorts of grief,	χώρας ἄνακτες, δόξα μοι παρεστάθη ναοὺς ἱκέσθαι δαιμόνων, τάδʼ ἐν χεροῖν στέφη λαβούσῃ κἀπιθυμιάματα. ὑψοῦ γὰρ αἴρει θυμὸν Οἰδίπους ἄγαν
as he does not judge the new things from the old, like a man of sense, but is under the control of the speaker, if he speaks of frightful things. Since, then, I can do no good by counsel, to you, Lycean Apollo—for you are nearest—	λύπαισι παντοίαισιν· οὐδʼ ὁποῖʼ ἀνὴρ ἔννους τὰ καινὰ τοῖς πάλαι τεκμαίρεται, ἀλλʼ ἐστὶ τοῦ λέγοντος, εἰ φόβους λέγοι. ὅτʼ οὖν παραινοῦσʼ οὐδὲν ἐς πλέον ποιῶ, πρὸς σʼ, ὦ Λύκειʼ Ἄπολλον, ἄγχιστος γὰρ εἶ,
I have come as a suppliant with these symbols of prayer, that you may find us some escape from uncleanliness. For now we are all afraid, like those who see fear in the helmsman of their ship.	ἱκέτις ἀφῖγμαι τοῖσδε σὺν κατεύγμασιν, ὅπως λύσιν τινʼ ἡμὶν εὐαγῆ πόρῃς· ὡς νῦν ὀκνοῦμεν πάντες ἐκπεπληγμένον κεῖνον βλέποντες ὡς κυβερνήτην νεώς.
Can you tell me, strangers, where	ἆρʼ ἂν παρʼ ὑμῶν, ὦ ξένοι, μάθοιμʼ ὅπου
the house of King Oedipus is? Or better still, tell me where he himself is, if you know.	τὰ τοῦ τυράννου δώματʼ ἐστὶν Οἰδίπου; μάλιστα δʼ αὐτὸν εἴπατʼ, εἰ κάτισθʼ ὅπου.
This is his dwelling, and he himself, stranger, is within. This lady here is the mother of his children.	στέγαι μὲν αἵδε, καὐτὸς ἔνδον, ὦ ξένε· γυνὴ δὲ μήτηρ ἥδε τῶν κείνου τέκνων.
Then may she be ever happy in a happy home,	ἀλλʼ ὀλβία τε καὶ ξὺν ὀλβίοις ἀεὶ
since she is his blessed queen.	γένοιτʼ, ἐκείνου γʼ οὖσα παντελὴς δάμαρ.
Happiness to you also, stranger! Your fair greeting deserves this. But say what you have come to seek or to tell.	αὔτως δὲ καὶ σύ γʼ, ὦ ξένʼ· ἄξιος γὰρ εἶ τῆς εὐεπείας εἵνεκʼ· ἀλλὰ φράζʼ ὅτου χρῄζων ἀφῖξαι χὤ τι σημῆναι θέλων.
Good tidings, lady, for your house and your husband.	ἀγαθὰ δόμοις τε καὶ πόσει τῷ σῷ, γύναι.
What are they? From whom have you come?	τὰ ποῖα ταῦτα; παρὰ τίνος δʼ ἀφιγμένος;
From Corinth , and at the message I will give now you will doubtless rejoice, though you may perhaps grieve too.	ἐκ τῆς Κορίνθου· τὸ δʼ ἔπος οὑξερῶ τάχα, ἥδοιο μέν, πῶς δʼ οὐκ ἄν, ἀσχάλλοις δʼ ἴσως.
What is it? Why has it this double potency?	τί δʼ ἔστι; ποίαν δύναμιν ὧδʼ ἔχει διπλῆν;
The people will make him king of the	τύραννον αὐτὸν οὑπιχώριοι χθονὸς
Isthmian land, as it was said there.	τῆς Ἰσθμίας στήσουσιν, ὡς ηὐδᾶτʼ ἐκεῖ.
How then? Is the aged Polybus no longer in power?	τί δʼ; οὐχ ὁ πρέσβυς Πόλυβος ἐγκρατὴς ἔτι;
No. For death holds him in the tomb.	οὐ δῆτʼ, ἐπεί νιν θάνατος ἐν τάφοις ἔχει.
What do you mean? Is Polybus dead, old man?	πῶς εἶπας; ἦ τέθνηκε Πόλυβος, ὦ γέρον;
If I do not speak the truth, I am content to die.	εἰ μὴ λέγω τἀληθές, ἀξιῶ θανεῖν.
Handmaid, away with all speed, and tell this to your master! Oracles of the gods, where do you stand now? It is this man that Oedipus long feared he would slay. And now this man has died in the course of destiny, not by his hand.	ὦ πρόσπολʼ, οὐχὶ δεσπότῃ τάδʼ ὡς τάχος μολοῦσα λέξεις; ὦ θεῶν μαντεύματα, ἵνʼ ἐστέ· τοῦτον Οἰδίπους πάλαι τρέμων τὸν ἄνδρʼ ἔφευγε μὴ κτάνοι, καὶ νῦν ὅδε πρὸς τῆς τύχης ὄλωλεν οὐδὲ τοῦδʼ ὕπο.
Iocasta, dearest wife, why have you summoned me forth from these doors?	ὦ φίλτατον γυναικὸς Ἰοκάστης κάρα, τί μʼ ἐξεπέμψω δεῦρο τῶνδε δωμάτων;
Hear this man, and judge, as you listen, what the awful oracles have come to.	ἄκουε τἀνδρὸς τοῦδε, καὶ σκόπει κλύων τὰ σέμνʼ ἵνʼ ἥκει τοῦ θεοῦ μαντεύματα.
Who is he and what news does he have for me?	οὗτος δὲ τίς ποτʼ ἐστὶ καὶ τί μοι λέγει;
He comes from Corinth to tell you that your father Polybus lives no longer, but has perished.	ἐκ τῆς Κορίνθου, πατέρα τὸν σὸν ἀγγελῶν ὡς οὐκέτʼ ὄντα Πόλυβον, ἀλλʼ ὀλωλότα.
How, stranger? Let me have it from your own mouth.	τί φῄς, ξένʼ; αὐτός μοι σὺ σημάντωρ γενοῦ.
If I must first make these tidings plain, know indeed that he is dead and gone.	εἰ τοῦτο πρῶτον δεῖ μʼ ἀπαγγεῖλαι σαφῶς, εὖ ἴσθʼ ἐκεῖνον θανάσιμον βεβηκότα.
By treachery, or from illness?	πότερα δόλοισιν ἢ νόσου ξυναλλαγῇ;
A light tilt of the scale brings the aged to their rest.	σμικρὰ παλαιὰ σώματʼ εὐνάζει ῥοπή.
Ah, he died, it seems, of sickness?	νόσοις ὁ τλήμων, ὡς ἔοικεν, ἔφθιτο.
Yes, and of the long years that he had lived.	καὶ τῷ μακρῷ γε συμμετρούμενος χρόνῳ.
Alas, alas! Why indeed, my wife, should one look to the	φεῦ φεῦ, τί δῆτʼ ἄν, ὦ γύναι, σκοποῖτό τι
hearth of the Pythian seer, or to the birds that scream above our heads, who declared that I was doomed to slay my father? But he is dead, and lies beneath the earth, and here I am, not having put my hand to any spear—unless, perhaps, he died out of longing for me:	τὴν Πυθόμαντιν ἑστίαν ἢ τοὺς ἄνω κλάζοντας ὄρνεις, ὧν ὑφηγητῶν ἐγὼ κτενεῖν ἔμελλον πατέρα τὸν ἐμόν; ὁ δὲ θανὼν κεύθει κάτω δὴ γῆς. ἐγὼ δʼ ὅδʼ ἐνθάδε ἄψαυστος ἔγχους· εἴ τι μὴ τὠμῷ πόθῳ
thus, indeed, I would be the cause of his death. But as the oracles stand, at least, Polybus has swept them with him to his rest in Hades. They are worth nothing.	κατέφθιθʼ· οὕτω δʼ ἂν θανὼν εἴη ʼξ ἐμοῦ. τὰ δʼ οὖν παρόντα συλλαβὼν θεσπίσματα κεῖται παρʼ Ἅιδῃ Πόλυβος ἄξιʼ οὐδενός.
Did I not long ago foretell this to you?	οὔκουν ἐγώ σοι ταῦτα προύλεγον πάλαι;
You did, but I was mislead by my fear.	ηὔδας· ἐγὼ δὲ τῷ φόβῳ παρηγόμην.
Now no longer take any of those things to heart.	μὴ νῦν ἔτʼ αὐτῶν μηδὲν ἐς θυμὸν βάλῃς.
But surely I must fear my mother’s bed.	καὶ πῶς τὸ μητρὸς οὐκ ὀκνεῖν λέχος με δεῖ;
What should a mortal man fear, for whom the decrees of Fortune are supreme, and who has clear foresight of nothing? It is best to live at random, as one may.	τί δʼ ἂν φοβοῖτʼ ἄνθρωπος ᾧ τὰ τῆς τύχης κρατεῖ, πρόνοια δʼ ἐστὶν οὐδενὸς σαφής; εἰκῆ κράτιστον ζῆν, ὅπως δύναιτό τις.
But fear not that you will wed your mother. Many men before now have slept with their mothers in dreams. But he to whom these things are as though nothing bears his life most easily.	σὺ δʼ εἰς τὰ μητρὸς μὴ φοβοῦ νυμφεύματα· πολλοὶ γὰρ ἤδη κἀν ὀνείρασιν βροτῶν μητρὶ ξυνηυνάσθησαν. ἀλλὰ ταῦθʼ ὅτῳ παρʼ οὐδέν ἐστι, ῥᾷστα τὸν βίον φέρει.
All these words of yours would have been well said,	καλῶς ἅπαντα ταῦτʼ ἂν ἐξείρητό σοι,
were my mother not alive. But as it is, since she lives, I must necessarily fear, though you do speak well.	εἰ μὴ ʼκύρει ζῶσʼ ἡ τεκοῦσα· νῦν δʼ ἐπεὶ ζῇ, πᾶσʼ ἀνάγκη, κεἰ καλῶς λέγεις, ὀκνεῖν.
Your father’s death is a great sign for us to take cheer.	καὶ μὴν μέγας γʼ ὀφθαλμὸς οἱ πατρὸς τάφοι.
Great, I know. But my fear is of her who lives.	μέγας, ξυνίημʼ· ἀλλὰ τῆς ζώσης φόβος.
And who is the woman about whom you fear?	ποίας δὲ καὶ γυναικὸς ἐκφοβεῖσθʼ ὕπερ;
Merope, old man, the consort of Polybus.	Μερόπης, γεραιέ, Πόλυβος ἧς ᾤκει μέτα.
And what is it in her that moves your fear?	τί δʼ ἔστʼ ἐκείνης ὑμὶν ἐς φόβον φέρον;
A divine oracle of dread import, stranger.	θεήλατον μάντευμα δεινόν, ὦ ξένε.
Proper, or improper, for another to know?	ἦ ῥητόν; ἢ οὐχὶ θεμιτὸν ἄλλον εἰδέναι;
Proper, surely. Loxias once said that I was	μάλιστά γʼ· εἶπε γάρ με Λοξίας ποτὲ
doomed to marry my own mother, and to shed with my own hands my father’s blood. For which reasons I long shirked my home in Corinth—with a happy outcome, to be sure, but still it is sweet to see the face of one’s parents.	χρῆναι μιγῆναι μητρὶ τἠμαυτοῦ τό τε πατρῷον αἷμα χερσὶ ταῖς ἐμαῖς ἑλεῖν. ὧν οὕνεχʼ ἡ Κόρινθος ἐξ ἐμοῦ πάλαι μακρὰν ἀπῳκεῖτʼ· εὐτυχῶς μέν, ἀλλʼ ὅμως
Was it really for fear of this that you became an exile from that city?	τὰ τῶν τεκόντων ὄμμαθʼ ἥδιστον βλέπειν.
And because I did not wish, old man, to be the murderer of my father.	ἦ γὰρ τάδʼ ὀκνῶν κεῖθεν ἦσθʼ ἀπόπτολις;
Why have I not relieved you of this second fear, my lord, since I came to give you pleasure?	πατρός τε χρῄζων μὴ φονεὺς εἶναι, γέρον.
And indeed you will have worthy thanks from me.	τί δῆτʼ ἐγὼ οὐχὶ τοῦδε τοῦ φόβου σʼ, ἄναξ, ἐπείπερ εὔνους ἦλθον, ἐξελυσάμην;
And indeed I came specially for this, that	καὶ μὴν χάριν γʼ ἂν ἀξίαν λάβοις ἐμοῦ.
I might profit from your returning home.	καὶ μὴν μάλιστα τοῦτʼ ἀφικόμην, ὅπως σοῦ πρὸς δόμους ἐλθόντος εὖ πράξαιμί τι.
But by no means will I ever go near my parents again.	ἀλλʼ οὔποτʼ εἶμι τοῖς φυτεύσασίν γʼ ὅμοῦ.
My son, it is crystal clear that you do not know what you are doing.	ὦ παῖ, καλῶς εἶ δῆλος οὐκ εἰδὼς τί δρᾷς.
How so, old man? In the name of the gods, tell me.	πῶς, ὦ γεραιέ; πρὸς θεῶν δίδασκέ με.
If on account of this you are fleeing from returning home.	εἰ τῶνδε φεύγεις οὕνεκʼ εἰς οἴκους μολεῖν.
Fearing indeed lest Apollo’s prophecy come true in me.	ταρβῶν γε μή μοι Φοῖβος ἐξέλθῃ σαφής.
Lest you acquire some pollution from your parents?	ἦ μὴ μίασμα τῶν φυτευσάντων λάβῃς;
This very thing, old man, this constantly frightens me.	τοῦτʼ αὐτό, πρέσβυ, τοῦτό μʼ εἰσαεὶ φοβεῖ.
Do you know, then, that your fears are wholly in vain?	ἆρʼ οἶσθα δῆτα πρὸς δίκης οὐδὲν τρέμων;
How so, if I was born of those parents?	πῶς δʼ οὐχί, παῖς γʼ εἰ τῶνδε γεννητῶν ἔφυν;
Because you had no blood in common with Polybus.	ὁθούνεκʼ ἦν σοι Πόλυβος οὐδὲν ἐν γένει.
What are you saying? Was Polybus not my father?	πῶς εἶπας; οὐ γὰρ Πόλυβος ἐξέφυσέ με;
Just as much, and no more, than he who speaks to you.	οὐ μᾶλλον οὐδὲν τοῦδε τἀνδρός, ἀλλʼ ἴσον.
And how can my father be equal to him who is as though nothing to me?	καὶ πῶς ὁ φύσας ἐξ ἴσου τῷ μηδενί;
But he did not father you, any more than I did.	ἀλλʼ οὔ σʼ ἐγείνατʼ οὔτʼ ἐκεῖνος οὔτʼ ἐγώ.
How, then, did he call me his son?	ἀλλʼ ἀντὶ τοῦ δὴ παῖδά μʼ ὠνομάζετο;
Long ago he received you as a gift from my hands.	δῶρόν ποτʼ, ἴσθι, τῶν ἐμῶν χειρῶν λαβών.
And yet he loved me so dearly, who came from another’s hand?	κᾆθʼ ὧδʼ ἀπʼ ἄλλης χειρὸς ἔστερξεν μέγα;
His former childlessness won him over.	ἡ γὰρ πρὶν αὐτὸν ἐξέπεισʼ ἀπαιδία.
And had you bought me or found me by chance, when you gave me to him?	σὺ δʼ ἐμπολήσας ἢ τυχών μʼ αὐτῷ δίδως;
I found you in Cithaeron’s winding glens.	εὑρὼν ναπαίαις ἐν Κιθαιρῶνος πτυχαῖς.
And why were you roaming those regions?	ὡδοιπόρεις δὲ πρὸς τί τούσδε τοὺς τόπους;
I was in charge of mountain flocks.	ἐνταῦθʼ ὀρείοις ποιμνίοις ἐπεστάτουν.
What, you were a shepherd—a vagrant hireling?	ποιμὴν γὰρ ἦσθα κἀπὶ θητείᾳ πλάνης;
But your savior, my son, in that hour.	σοῦ τʼ, ὦ τέκνον, σωτήρ γε τῷ τότʼ ἐν χρόνῳ.
And what was my pain when you took me in your arms?	τί δʼ ἄλγος ἴσχοντʼ ἀγκάλαις με λαμβάνεις;
The ankles of your feet might bear witness.	ποδῶν ἂν ἄρθρα μαρτυρήσειεν τὰ σά·
Ah me, why do you speak of that old trouble?	οἴμοι, τί τοῦτʼ ἀρχαῖον ἐννέπεις κακόν;
I freed you when you had your ankles pinned together.	λύω σʼ ἔχοντα διατόρους ποδοῖν ἀκμάς.
It was a dread brand of shame that I took from my cradle.	δεινόν γʼ ὄνειδος σπαργάνων ἀνειλόμην.
So much so that from that fortune you were called by that name which you still bear.	ὥστʼ ὠνομάσθης ἐκ τύχης ταύτης ὃς εἶ.
Oh, in the name of the gods, was the deed my mother’s or father’s? Speak!	ὦ πρὸς θεῶν, πρὸς μητρὸς ἢ πατρός; φράσον.
I know not. He who gave you to me knows better of that than I.	οὐκ οἶδʼ· ὁ δοὺς δὲ ταῦτʼ ἐμοῦ λῷον φρονεῖ.
What, you got me from another? You did not find me yourself?	ἦ γὰρ παρʼ ἄλλου μʼ ἔλαβες οὐδʼ αὐτὸς τυχών;
No. Another shepherd gave you to me.	οὔκ, ἀλλὰ ποιμὴν ἄλλος ἐκδίδωσί μοι.
Who was he? Can you tell clearly?	τίς οὗτος; ἦ κάτοισθα δηλῶσαι λόγῳ;
I think he was said to be one of the household of Laius.	τῶν Λαΐου δήπου τις ὠνομάζετο.
The king who ruled this country long ago?	ἦ τοῦ τυράννου τῆσδε γῆς πάλαι ποτέ;
The same. The man was a herdsman in his service.	μάλιστα· τούτου τἀνδρὸς οὗτος ἦν βοτήρ.
Is he still alive, that I might see him?	ἦ κἄστʼ ἔτι ζῶν οὗτος, ὥστʼ ἰδεῖν ἐμέ;
You natives of this country should know best.	ὑμεῖς γʼ ἄριστʼ εἰδεῖτʼ ἂν οὑπιχώριοι.
Is there any of you here present that knows the herdsman of whom he speaks, having seen him either in the pastures or here in town? Answer!	ἔστιν τις ὑμῶν τῶν παρεστώτων πέλας, ὅστις κάτοιδε τὸν βοτῆρʼ ὃν ἐννέπει, εἴτʼ οὖν ἐπʼ ἀγρῶν εἴτε κἀνθάδʼ εἰσιδών;
The hour has come for these things to be revealed finally.	σημήναθʼ, ὡς ὁ καιρὸς ηὑρῆσθαι τάδε.
I think he speaks of no other than the peasant you already wanted to see. But our lady Iocasta might best tell you that.	οἶμαι μὲν οὐδένʼ ἄλλον ἢ τὸν ἐξ ἀγρῶν, ὃν κἀμάτευες πρόσθεν εἰσιδεῖν· ἀτὰρ ἥδʼ ἂν τάδʼ οὐχ ἥκιστʼ ἂν Ἰοκάστη λέγοι.
Lady, do you know the one whom we summoned just now?	γύναι, νοεῖς ἐκεῖνον, ὅντινʼ ἀρτίως
Is it of him that this man speaks?	μολεῖν ἐφιέμεσθα; τόνδʼ οὗτος λέγει;
Why ask of whom he spoke? Regard it not; waste not a thought on what he said; it would be vain.	τί δʼ ὅντινʼ εἶπε; μηδὲν ἐντραπῇς· τὰ δὲ ῥηθέντα βούλου μηδὲ μεμνῆσθαι μάτην.
It must not happen that, with such clues in my grasp, I fail to bring my birth to light.	οὐκ ἂν γένοιτο τοῦθʼ ὅπως ἐγὼ λαβὼν σημεῖα τοιαῦτʼ οὐ φανῶ τοὐμὸν γένος.
For the gods’ sake, if you have any care for your own life, do not continue this search! My anguish is enough.	μὴ πρὸς θεῶν, εἴπερ τι τοῦ σαυτοῦ βίου κήδει, ματεύσῃς τοῦθʼ· ἅλις νοσοῦσʼ ἐγώ.
Be of good courage. Even if I should be found the son of a servile mother—a slave by three descents—you will not be proven baseborn.	θάρσει· σὺ μὲν γὰρ οὐδʼ ἐὰν τρίτης ἐγὼ μητρὸς φανῶ τρίδουλος, ἐκφανεῖ κακή.
Hear me, I implore you: do not do this.	ὅμως πιθοῦ μοι, λίσσομαι· μὴ δρᾶ τάδε.
I will not hear of not discovering the whole truth.	οὐκ ἂν πιθοίμην μὴ οὐ τάδʼ ἐκμαθεῖν σαφῶς.
Yet I wish you well—I counsel you for the best.	καὶ μὴν φρονοῦσά γʼ εὖ τὰ λῷστά σοι λέγω.
These best counsels, then, vex my patience.	τὰ λῷστα τοίνυν ταῦτά μʼ ἀλγύνει πάλαι.
Oh ill-fated man, may you never know who you are!	ὦ δύσποτμʼ, εἴθε μήποτε γνοίης ὃς εἶ.
Go, some one, fetch me the herdsman.	ἄξει τις ἐλθὼν δεῦρο τὸν βοτῆρά μοι;
Leave this woman to glory in her princely stock.	ταύτην δʼ ἐᾶτε πλουσίῳ χαίρειν γένει.
Alas, alas, miserable man—that word alone can I say to you—and no other word ever again.	ἰοὺ ἰού, δύστηνε· τοῦτο γάρ σʼ ἔχω μόνον προσειπεῖν, ἄλλο δʼ οὔποθʼ ὕστερον.
Why has this woman gone, Oedipus, rushing off in wild grief? I fear	τί ποτε βέβηκεν, Οἰδίπους, ὑπʼ ἀγρίας ᾄξασα λύπης ἡ γυνή; δέδοιχʼ ὅπως
a storm of sorrow will soon break forth from this silence.	μὴ ʼκ τῆς σιωπῆς τῆσδʼ ἀναρρήξει κακά.
Break forth what will! Be my race ever so lowly, I crave to learn it. That woman perhaps—for she is proud with more than a woman’s pride—feels ashamed of my lowly origin. But I, who hold myself son of Fortune	ὁποῖα χρῄζει ῥηγνύτω· τοὐμὸν δʼ ἐγώ, κεἰ σμικρόν ἐστι, σπέρμʼ ἰδεῖν βουλήσομαι. αὕτη δʼ ἴσως, φρονεῖ γὰρ ὡς γυνὴ μέγα, τὴν δυσγένειαν τὴν ἐμὴν αἰσχύνεται.
that gives good, will not be dishonored. She is the mother from whom I spring, and the months, my kinsmen, have marked me sometimes lowly, sometimes great. Such being my heritage, never more can I prove	ἐγὼ δʼ ἐμαυτὸν παῖδα τῆς Τύχης νέμων τῆς εὖ διδούσης οὐκ ἀτιμασθήσομαι. τῆς γὰρ πέφυκα μητρός· οἱ δὲ συγγενεῖς μῆνές με μικρὸν καὶ μέγαν διώρισαν. τοιόσδε δʼ ἐκφὺς οὐκ ἂν ἐξέλθοιμʼ ἔτι
false to it, or keep from searching out the secret of my birth.	ποτʼ ἄλλος, ὥστε μὴ ʼκμαθεῖν τοὐμὸν γένος.
If I am a seer or wise of heart,	εἴπερ ἐγὼ μάντις εἰμὶ καὶ κατὰ γνώμαν ἴδρις, οὐ τὸν Ὄλυμπον ἀπείρων, ὦ Κιθαιρών,
Cithaeron, you will not fail—by heaven, you will not—to know at tomorrow’s full moon that Oedipus honors you as native to him, as his nurse, and his mother, and that you are celebrated in our dance and song,	οὐκ ἔσει τὰν αὔριον πανσέληνον, μὴ οὐ σέ γε καὶ πατριώταν Οἰδίπουν καὶ τροφὸν καὶ ματέρʼ αὔξειν,
because you are well-pleasing to our prince. O Phoebus to whom we cry, may these things find favor in your sight!	καὶ χορεύεσθαι πρὸς ἡμῶν, ὡς ἐπὶ ἦρα φέροντα τοῖς ἐμοῖς τυράννοις. ἰήϊε Φοῖβε, σοὶ δὲ ταῦτʼ ἀρέστʼ εἴη.
Who was it, my son, who of the race whose years are many, that bore you in wedlock with	τίς σε, τέκνον, τίς σʼ ἔτικτε τᾶν μακραιώνων ἄρα
Pan, the mountain-roaming father? Or was it a bride of Loxias that bore you? For dear to him are all the upland pastures.	Πανὸς ὀρεσσιβάτα πατρὸς πελασθεῖσʼ; ἢ σέ γʼ εὐνάτειρά τις Λοξίου; τῷ γὰρ πλάκες ἀγρόνομοι πᾶσαι φίλαι·
Or perhaps it was Cyllene’s lord, or the Bacchants’ god, dweller on the hill-tops, that received you, a new-born joy, from one of the nymphs of Helicon, with whom he most often sports.	εἴθʼ ὁ Κυλλάνας ἀνάσσων, εἴθʼ ὁ Βακχεῖος θεὸς ναίων ἐπʼ ἄκρων ὀρέων σʼ εὕρημα δέξατʼ ἔκ του Νυμφᾶν Ἑλικωνίδων, αἷς πλεῖστα συμπαίζει.
Elders, if it is right for me, who have never met the man, to guess, I think I see the herdsman we have been looking for for a lone time. In his venerable old age he tallies with this stranger’s years, and moreover I recognize those who bring him, I think, as servants of mine.	εἰ χρή τι κἀμὲ μὴ συναλλάξαντά πω, πρέσβεις, σταθμᾶσθαι, τὸν βοτῆρʼ ὁρᾶν δοκῶ, ὅνπερ πάλαι ζητοῦμεν· ἔν τε γὰρ μακρῷ γήρᾳ ξυνᾴδει τῷδε τἀνδρὶ σύμμετρος, ἄλλως τε τοὺς ἄγοντας ὥσπερ οἰκέτας
But perhaps you have an advantage in knowledge over me, if you have seen the herdsman before.	ἔγνωκʼ ἐμαυτοῦ· τῇ δʼ ἐπιστήμῃ σύ μου προύχοις τάχʼ ἄν που, τὸν βοτῆρʼ ἰδὼν πάρος.
Yes, I know him, be sure. He was in the service of Laius—trusty as any shepherd.	ἔγνωκα γάρ, σάφʼ ἴσθι· Λαΐου γὰρ ἦν εἴπερ τις ἄλλος πιστὸς ὡς νομεὺς ἀνήρ.
I ask you first, Corinthian stranger, if this is the man you mean.	σὲ πρῶτʼ ἐρωτῶ, τὸν Κορίνθιον ξένον, ἦ τόνδε φράζεις;
He is, the one you are looking at.	τοῦτον, ὅνπερ εἰσορᾷς.
You, old man—look this way and answer all that I ask—were you once in the service of Laius?	οὗτος σύ, πρέσβυ, δεῦρό μοι φώνει βλέπων ὅσʼ ἄν σʼ ἐρωτῶ. Λαΐου ποτʼ ἦσθα σύ;
I was—not a bought slave, but reared in his house.	ἦ δοῦλος οὐκ ὠνητός, ἀλλʼ οἴκοι τραφείς.
Employed in what labor, or what way of life?	ἔργον μεριμνῶν ποῖον ἢ βίον τινά;
For the better part of my life I tended the flocks.	ποίμναις τὰ πλεῖστα τοῦ βίου συνειπόμην.
And what regions did you most frequently haunt?	χώροις μάλιστα πρὸς τίσι ξύναυλος ὤν;
Sometimes Cithaeron, sometimes the neighboring ground.	ἦν μὲν Κιθαιρών, ἦν δὲ πρόσχωρος τόπος.
Are you aware of ever having seen this man in these parts?	τὸν ἄνδρα τόνδʼ οὖν οἶσθα τῇδέ που μαθών;
Doing what? What man do you mean?	τί χρῆμα δρῶντα; ποῖον ἄνδρα καὶ λέγεις;
This man here. Have you ever met him before?	τόνδʼ ὃς πάρεστιν· ἢ ξυναλλάξας τί πω;
Not so that I could speak at once from memory.	οὐχ ὥστε γʼ εἰπεῖν ἐν τάχει μνήμης ἄπο.
And no wonder, master. But I will bring clear recollection to his ignorance. I am sure he knows well of the time we dwelled in the region of Cithaeron	κοὐδέν γε θαῦμα, δέσποτʼ· ἀλλʼ ἐγὼ σαφῶς ἀγνῶτʼ ἀναμνήσω νιν. εὖ γὰρ οἶδʼ ὅτι κάτοιδεν, ἦμος τῷ Κιθαιρῶνος τόπῳ,
for six month periods, from spring to Arcturus, he with two flocks, and I, his comrade, with one. And then for the winter I used to drive my flock to my own fold, and he took his to the fold of Laius.	ὁ μὲν διπλοῖσι ποιμνίοις, ἐγὼ δʼ ἑνί, ἐπλησίαζον τῷδε τἀνδρὶ τρεῖς ὅλους ἐξ ἦρος εἰς ἀρκτοῦρον ἑκμήνους χρόνους· χειμῶνα δʼ ἤδη τἀμά τʼ εἰς ἔπαυλʼ ἐγὼ ἤλαυνον οὗτός τʼ εἰς τὰ Λαΐου σταθμά.
Did any of this happen as I tell it, or did it not?	λέγω τι τούτων ἢ οὐ λέγω πεπραγμένον;
You speak the truth, though it was long ago.	λέγεις ἀληθῆ, καίπερ ἐκ μακροῦ χρόνου.
Come, tell me now: do you remember having given me a boy in those days, to be reared as my own foster-son?	φέρʼ εἰπὲ νῦν, τότʼ οἶσθα παῖδά μοί τινα δούς, ὡς ἐμαυτῷ θρέμμα θρεψαίμην ἐγώ;
What now? Why do you ask the question?	τί δʼ ἔστι; πρὸς τί τοῦτο τοὔπος ἱστορεῖς;
This man, my friend, is he who then was young.	ὅδʼ ἐστίν, ὦ τᾶν, κεῖνος ὃς τότʼ ἦν νέος.
Damn you! Be silent once and for all!	οὐκ εἰς ὄλεθρον; οὐ σιωπήσας ἔσει;
Do not rebuke him, old man. Your words need rebuking more than his.	ἆ, μὴ κόλαζε, πρέσβυ, τόνδʼ, ἐπεὶ τὰ σὰ
And in what way, most noble master, do I offend?	δεῖται κολαστοῦ μᾶλλον ἢ τὰ τοῦδʼ ἔπη. τί δʼ, ὦ φέριστε δεσποτῶν, ἁμαρτάνω;
In not telling of the boy about whom he asks.	οὐκ ἐννέπων τὸν παῖδʼ ὃν οὗτος ἱστορεῖ.
He speaks without knowledge, but is busy to no purpose.	λέγει γὰρ εἰδὼς οὐδέν, ἀλλʼ ἄλλως πονεῖ.
You will not speak with good grace, but will in pain.	σὺ πρὸς χάριν μὲν οὐκ ἐρεῖς, κλαίων δʼ ἐρεῖς.
No, in the name of the gods, do not mistreat an old man.	μὴ δῆτα, πρὸς θεῶν, τὸν γέροντά μʼ αἰκίσῃ.
Someone, quick—tie his hands him this instant!	οὐχ ὡς τάχος τις τοῦδʼ ἀποστρέψει χέρας;
Alas, why? What do you want to learn?	δύστηνος, ἀντὶ τοῦ; τί προσχρῄζων μαθεῖν;
Did you give this man the child about whom he asks?	τὸν παῖδʼ ἔδωκας τῷδʼ ὃν οὗτος ἱστορεῖ;
I did. Would that I had perished that day!	ἔδωκʼ· ὀλέσθαι δʼ ὤφελον τῇδʼ ἡμέρᾳ.
Well, you will come to that, unless you tell the honest truth.	ἀλλʼ εἰς τόδʼ ἥξεις μὴ λέγων γε τοὔνδικον.
But if I speak I will be destroyed all the more.	πολλῷ γε μᾶλλον, ἢν φράσω, διόλλυμαι.
This man is bent, I think, on more delays.	ἁνὴρ ὅδʼ, ὡς ἔοικεν, ἐς τριβὰς ἐλᾷ.
No, no! I said before that I gave it to him.	οὐ δῆτʼ ἔγωγʼ, ἀλλʼ εἶπον, ὡς δοίην, πάλαι.
Where did you get it from? From your own house, or from another?	πόθεν λαβών; οἰκεῖον ἢ ʼξ ἄλλου τινός;
It was not my own: I received it from another.	ἐμὸν μὲν οὐκ ἔγωγʼ, ἐδεξάμην δέ του.
From whom of the citizens here? From what home?	τίνος πολιτῶν τῶνδε κἀκ ποίας στέγης;
For the love of the gods, master, ask no more!	μὴ πρὸς θεῶν, μή, δέσποθʼ, ἱστόρει πλέον.
You are dead if I have to question you again.	ὄλωλας, εἴ σε ταῦτʼ ἐρήσομαι πάλιν.
It was a child, then, of the house of Laius.	τῶν Λαΐου τοίνυν τις ἦν γεννημάτων.
A slave? Or one of his own clan?	ἦ δοῦλος ἢ κείνου τις ἐγγενὴς γεγώς;
Alas! I am on the brink of speaking the dreaded words.	οἴμοι, πρὸς αὐτῷ γʼ εἰμὶ τῷ δεινῷ λέγειν.
And I of hearing: I must hear nevertheless.	κἄγωγʼ ἀκούειν· ἀλλʼ ὅμως ἀκουστέον.
You must know then, that it was said to be his own child. But your lady within could say best how these matters lie.	κείνου γέ τοι δὴ παῖς ἐκλῄζεθʼ· ἡ δʼ ἔσω κάλλιστʼ ἂν εἴποι σὴ γυνὴ τάδʼ ὡς ἔχει.
How? Did she give it to you?	ἦ γὰρ δίδωσιν ἥδε σοι;
Yes, my lord.	μάλιστʼ, ἄναξ.
For what purpose?	ὡς πρὸς τί χρείας;
That I should do away with it.	ὡς ἀναλώσαιμί νιν.
Her own child, the wretched woman?	τεκοῦσα τλήμων;
Yes, from fear of the evil prophecies.	θεσφάτων γʼ ὄκνῳ κακῶν.
What were they?	ποίων;
The tale ran that he would slay his father.	κτενεῖν νιν τοὺς τεκόντας ἦν λόγος.
Why, then, did you give him to this old man?	πῶς δῆτʼ ἀφῆκας τῷ γέροντι τῷδε σύ;
Out of pity, master, thinking that he would carry him to another land, from where he himself came. But he saved him for the direst woe.	κατοικτίσας, ὦ δέσποθʼ, ὡς ἄλλην χθόνα δοκῶν ἀποίσειν, αὐτὸς ἔνθεν ἦν· ὁ δὲ
For if you are what this man says, be certain that you were born ill-fated.	κάκʼ εἰς μέγιστʼ ἔσωσεν. εἰ γὰρ οὗτος εἶ ὅν φησιν οὗτος, ἴσθι δύσποτμος γεγώς.
Oh, oh! All brought to pass, all true. Light, may I now look on you for the last time—I who have been found to be accursed in birth,	ἰοὺ ἰού· τὰ πάντʼ ἂν ἐξήκοι σαφῆ. ὦ φῶς, τελευταῖόν σε προσβλέψαιμι νῦν, ὅστις πέφασμαι φύς τʼ ἀφʼ ὧν οὐ χρῆν, ξὺν οἷς τʼ
accursed in wedlock, accursed in the shedding of blood.	οὐ χρῆν ὁμιλῶν, οὕς τέ μʼ οὐκ ἔδει κτανών.
Alas, generations of mortals, how mere a shadow I count your life! Where, where is the mortal who	ἰὼ γενεαὶ βροτῶν, ὡς ὑμᾶς ἴσα καὶ τὸ μηδὲν ζώσας ἐναριθμῶ. τίς γάρ, τίς ἀνὴρ πλέον
attains a happiness which is more than apparent and doomed to fall away to nothing? Your fate warns me—yours, unhappy Oedipus—to call no	τᾶς εὐδαιμονίας φέρει ἢ τοσοῦτον ὅσον δοκεῖν καὶ δόξαντʼ ἀποκλῖναι; τὸν σόν τοι παράδειγμʼ ἔχων, τὸν σὸν δαίμονα, τὸν σόν, ὦ τλᾶμον Οἰδιπόδα, βροτῶν
earthly creature blessed.	οὐδὲν μακαρίζω·
For he, O Zeus, shot his shaft with peerless skill, and won the prize of an all-prosperous fortune, having slain the maiden with crooked talons, who sang darkly.	ὅστις καθʼ ὑπερβολὰν τοξεύσας ἐκράτησε τοῦ πάντʼ εὐδαίμονος ὄλβου, ὦ Ζεῦ, κατὰ μὲν φθίσας τὰν γαμψώνυχα παρθένον
He arose for our land like a tower against death. And from that time, Oedipus, you have been called our king, and have been honored supremely, holding power in great Thebes .	χρησμῳδόν, θανάτων δʼ ἐμᾷ χώρᾳ πύργος ἀνέστα· ἐξ οὗ καὶ βασιλεὺς καλεῖ ἐμὸς καὶ τὰ μέγιστʼ ἐτιμάθης, ταῖς μεγάλαισιν ἐν Θήβαισιν ἀνάσσων.
But now whose story is more grievous in men’s ears?	τανῦν δʼ ἀκούειν τίς ἀθλιώτερος;
Who is a more wretched slave to fierce plagues and troubles, with all his life reversed? Alas, renowned Oedipus! The same bounteous harbor was sufficient for you, both as child and as father, to make your nuptial couch in. Oh, how can the soil	τίς ἄταις ἀγρίαις, τίς ἐν πόνοις ξύνοικος ἀλλαγᾷ βίου; ἰὼ κλεινὸν Οἰδίπου κάρα, ἦ στέγας λιμὴν αὑτὸς ἤρκεσεν παιδὶ καὶ πατρὶ θαλαμηπόλῳ πεσεῖν;
in which your father sowed, unhappy man, have endured you in silence for so long?	πῶς ποτε πῶς ποθʼ αἱ πατρῷαί σʼ ἄλοκες φέρειν, τάλας, σῖγʼ ἐδυνάθησαν ἐς τοσόνδε;
Time the all-seeing has found you out, against your will: he judges the monstrous marriage in which	ἐφηῦρέ σʼ ἄκονθʼ ὁ πάνθʼ ὁρῶν χρόνος, δικάζει τʼ ἄγαμον γάμον πάλαι
parent and child have long been one. Alas, child of Laius, would that I had never seen you. I wail as one who pours a dirge from his lips.	τεκνοῦντα καὶ τεκνούμενον. ἰώ, Λαΐειον ὦ τέκνον, εἴθε σʼ εἴθε σε μήποτʼ εἰδόμαν. δύρομαι γὰρ ὥσπερ ἰάλεμον χέων ἐκ στομάτων. τὸ δʼ ὀρθὸν εἰπεῖν, ἀνέπνευσά τʼ ἐκ
It was you who gave me new life, to speak directly, and through you darkness has fallen upon my eyes.	σέθεν καὶ κατεκοίμασα τοὐμὸν ὄμμα.
You who are most honored in this land, what deeds you will hear, what deeds you will behold, what burden of sorrow will be yours,	ὦ γῆς μέγιστα τῆσδʼ ἀεὶ τιμώμενοι, οἷʼ, ἔργʼ ἀκούσεσθʼ, οἷα δʼ εἰσόψεσθʼ, ὅσον δʼ
if, true to your race, you still care for the house of Labdacus. For I think that neither the Ister nor the Phasis could wash this house clean, so many are the ills that it shrouds, or will soon bring to light, ills wrought not unwittingly, but on purpose.	ἀρεῖσθε πένθος, εἴπερ ἐγγενῶς ἔτι τῶν Λαβδακείων ἐντρέπεσθε δωμάτων. οἶμαι γὰρ οὔτʼ ἂν Ἴστρον οὔτε Φᾶσιν ἂν νίψαι καθαρμῷ τήνδε τὴν στέγην, ὅσα κεύθει, τὰ δʼ αὐτίκʼ εἰς τὸ φῶς φανεῖ κακὰ
And those griefs smart the most which are seen to be of our own choice.	ἑκόντα κοὐκ ἄκοντα. τῶν δὲ πημονῶν μάλιστα λυποῦσʼ αἳ φανῶσʼ αὐθαίρετοι.
Indeed the troubles which we knew before are far from being easy to bear. Besides them, what do you have to announce?	λείπει μὲν οὐδʼ ἃ πρόσθεν εἴδομεν τὸ μὴ οὐ βαρύστονʼ εἶναι· πρὸς δʼ ἐκείνοισιν τί φῄς;
This is the shortest tale to tell and hear:	ὁ μὲν τάχιστος τῶν λόγων εἰπεῖν τε καὶ
our royal lady Iocasta is dead.	μαθεῖν, τέθνηκε θεῖον Ἰοκάστης κάρα.
Alas, wretched lady! From what cause?	ὦ δυστάλαινα, πρὸς τίνος ποτʼ αἰτίας;
By her own hand. You will not suffer the worst part of the painful event, since you do not behold the events. Nevertheless, so far as my memory serves,	αὐτὴ πρὸς αὑτῆς. τῶν δὲ πραχθέντων τὰ μὲν ἄλγιστʼ ἄπεστιν· ἡ γὰρ ὄψις οὐ πάρα. ὅμως δʼ, ὅσον γε κἀν ἐμοὶ μνήμης ἔνι,
you will learn that unhappy woman’s fate. When, frantic, she passed within the vestibule, she rushed straight towards her marriage couch, clutching her hair with the fingers of both hands. Once within the chamber,	πεύσει τὰ κείνης ἀθλίας παθήματα. ὅπως γὰρ ὀργῇ χρωμένη παρῆλθʼ ἔσω θυρῶνος, ἵετʼ εὐθὺ πρὸς τὰ νυμφικὰ λέχη, κόμην σπῶσʼ ἀμφιδεξίοις ἀκμαῖς. πύλας δʼ, ὅπως εἰσῆλθʼ, ἐπιρράξασʼ ἔσω
she dashed the doors together behind her, then called on the name of Laius, long since a corpse, thinking of that son, born long ago, by whose hand the father was slain, leaving the mother to breed accursed offspring with his own child. And she bewailed the marriage in which, wretched woman, she had given birth to a twofold brood,	καλεῖ τὸν ἤδη Λάϊον πάλαι νεκρόν, μνήμην παλαιῶν σπερμάτων ἔχουσʼ, ὑφʼ ὧν θάνοι μὲν αὐτός, τὴν δὲ τίκτουσαν λίποι τοῖς οἷσιν αὐτοῦ δύστεκνον παιδουργίαν. γοᾶτο δʼ εὐνάς, ἔνθα δύστηνος διπλοῦς
husband by husband, children by her child. And how she perished is more than I know. For with a shriek Oedipus burst in, and did not allow us to watch her woe until the end: on him, as he rushed around, our eyes were set.	ἐξ ἀνδρὸς ἄνδρα καὶ τέκνʼ ἐκ τέκνων τέκοι. χὤπως μὲν ἐκ τῶνδʼ οὐκέτʼ οἶδʼ ἀπόλλυται· βοῶν γὰρ εἰσέπαισεν Οἰδίπους, ὑφʼ οὗ οὐκ ἦν τὸ κείνης ἐκθεάσασθαι κακόν, ἀλλʼ εἰς ἐκεῖνον περιπολοῦντʼ ἐλεύσσομεν.
To and fro he went, asking us to give him a sword, asking where he could find the wife who was no wife, but a mother whose womb had borne both him and his children. And in his frenzy a power greater than mortal man was his guide, for it was none of us mortals who were near.	φοιτᾷ γὰρ ἡμᾶς ἔγχος ἐξαιτῶν πορεῖν, γυναῖκά τʼ οὐ γυναῖκα, μητρῴαν δʼ ὅπου κίχοι διπλῆν ἄρουραν οὗ τε καὶ τέκνων. λυσσῶντι δʼ αὐτῷ δαιμόνων δείκνυσί τις· οὐδεὶς γὰρ ἀνδρῶν, οἳ παρῆμεν ἐγγύθεν.
With a dread cry, as though someone beckoned him on, he sprang at the double doors, forced the bending bolts from the sockets, and rushed into the room. There we beheld the woman hanging by the neck in a twisted noose of swinging cords.	δεινὸν δʼ ἀύσας ὡς ὑφηγητοῦ τινος πύλαις διπλαῖς ἐνήλατʼ, ἐκ δὲ πυθμένων ἔκλινε κοῖλα κλῇθρα κἀμπίπτει στέγῃ. οὗ δὴ κρεμαστὴν τὴν γυναῖκʼ ἐσείδομεν, πλεκταῖσιν αἰώραισιν ἐμπεπλεγμένην.
And when he saw her, with a dread deep cry he released the halter by which she hung. And when the hapless woman was stretched out on the ground, then the sequel was horrible to see: for he tore from her raiment the golden brooches with which she had decorated herself,	ὁ δʼ ὡς ὁρᾷ νιν, δεινὰ βρυχηθεὶς τάλας χαλᾷ κρεμαστὴν ἀρτάνην. ἐπεὶ δὲ γῇ ἔκειτο τλήμων, δεινὰ δʼ ἦν τἀνθένδʼ ὁρᾶν. ἀποσπάσας γὰρ εἱμάτων χρυσηλάτους περόνας ἀπʼ αὐτῆς, αἷσιν ἐξεστέλλετο,
and lifting them struck his own eye-balls, uttering words like these: No longer will you behold such horrors as I was suffering and performing! Long enough have you looked on those whom you ought never to have seen, having failed in the knowledge of those whom I yearned to know—henceforth you shall be dark!	ἄρας ἔπαισεν ἄρθρα τῶν αὑτοῦ κύκλων, αὐδῶν τοιαῦθʼ, ὁθούνεκʼ οὐκ ὄψοιντό νιν οὔθʼ οἷʼ ἔπασχεν οὔθʼ ὁποῖʼ ἔδρα κακά, ἀλλʼ ἐν σκότῳ τὸ λοιπὸν οὓς μὲν οὐκ ἔδει ὀψοίαθʼ, οὓς δʼ ἔχρῃζεν οὐ γνωσοίατο.
With such a dire refrain, he struck his eyes with raised hand not once but often. At each blow the bloody eye-balls bedewed his beard, and sent forth not sluggish drops of gore, but all at once a dark shower of blood came down like hail.	τοιαῦτʼ ἐφυμνῶν πολλάκις τε κοὐχ ἅπαξ ἤρασσʼ ἐπαίρων βλέφαρα. φοίνιαι δʼ ὁμοῦ γλῆναι γένειʼ ἔτελλον, οὐδʼ ἀνίεσαν φόνου μυδώσας σταγόνας, ἀλλʼ ὁμοῦ μέλας ὄμβρος χαλάζης αἱματοῦς ἐτέγγετο. τάδʼ ἐκ δυοῖν ἔρρωγεν, οὐ μόνου κάτα,
From the deeds of the two of them such ills have broken forth, not on one alone, but with mingled woe for man and wife. The old happiness of their ancestral fortune was once happiness indeed. But now today lamentation, ruin, death, shame,	ἀλλʼ ἀνδρὶ καὶ γυναικὶ συμμιγῆ κακά. ὁ πρὶν παλαιὸς δʼ ὄλβος ἦν πάροιθε μὲν ὄλβος δικαίως· νῦν δὲ τῇδε θἠμέρᾳ στεναγμός, ἄτη, θάνατος, αἰσχύνη, κακῶν ὅσʼ ἐστὶ πάντων ὀνόματʼ, οὐδέν ἐστʼ ἀπόν.
and every earthly ill that anyone could name are all theirs.	νῦν δʼ ἔσθʼ ὁ τλήμων ἐν τίνι σχολῇ κακοῦ;
And does the sufferer have any respite from pain now?	βοᾷ διοίγειν κλῇθρα καὶ δηλοῦν τινα
He cries for some one to unbar the gates and show to all the Cadmeans his father’s slayer, his mother’s—the words must not pass my lips—	τοῖς πᾶσι Καδμείοισι τὸν πατροκτόνον, τὸν μητέρʼ—αὐδῶν ἀνόσιʼ οὐδὲ ῥητά μοι,
in order to banish himself from the land and not to put the house under his own curse by waiting here. And yet he lacks strength, and one to guide his steps, for the anguish is more than he can bear. He will soon show this to you: look, the bars of the gates are withdrawn,	ὡς ἐκ χθονὸς ῥίψων ἑαυτὸν οὐδʼ ἔτι μενῶν δόμοις ἀραῖος, ὡς ἠράσατο. ῥώμης γε μέντοι καὶ προηγητοῦ τινος δεῖται· τὸ γὰρ νόσημα μεῖζον ἢ φέρειν. δείξει δὲ καὶ σοί· κλῇθρα γὰρ πυλῶν τάδε
and soon you will behold a sight which even he who abhors it must pity.	διοίγεται· θέαμα δʼ εἰσόψει τάχα τοιοῦτον οἷον καὶ στυγοῦντʼ ἐποικτίσαι.
O dread fate for men to see, O most dreadful of all that I have set my eyes on! Unhappy one, what madness has come upon you?	ὦ δεινὸν ἰδεῖν πάθος ἀνθρώποις, ὦ δεινότατον πάντων ὅσʼ ἐγὼ προσέκυρσʼ ἤδη. τίς σʼ, ὦ τλῆμον,
Who is the unearthly foe who, with a leap of more than mortal range has made your ill-starred life his prey? Alas, alas, you hapless man! I cannot even look on you, though there is much I desire to ask, much I desire to learn,	προσέβη μανία; τίς ὁ πηδήσας μείζονα δαίμων τῶν μακίστων πρὸς σῇ δυσδαίμονι μοίρᾳ; φεῦ φεῦ, δύστανʼ· ἀλλʼ οὐδʼ ἐσιδεῖν δύναμαί σε, θέλων
much that draws my wistful gaze: with such a shuddering do you fill me!	πόλλʼ ἀνερέσθαι, πολλὰ πυθέσθαι, πολλὰ δʼ ἀθρῆσαι· τοίαν φρίκην παρέχεις μοι.
Woe is me! Alas, alas, wretched that I am! Where, where am I carried in my misery?	αἰαῖ αἰαῖ, δύστανος ἐγώ, ποῖ γᾶς φέρομαι τλάμων; πᾷ μοι
How is my voice swept abroad on the wings of the air? Oh, my fate, how far you have sprung!	φθογγὰ διαπωτᾶται φοράδην; ἰὼ δαῖμον, ἵνʼ ἐξήλλου.
To a dread place, dire in men’s ears, dire in their sight.	ἐς δεινὸν οὐδʼ ἀκουστὸν οὐδʼ ἐπόψιμον.
Oh horror of darkness that enfolds me, unspeakable visitant,	ἰὼ σκότου νέφος ἐμὸν ἀπότροπον, ἐπιπλόμενον ἄφατον,
resistless, sped by a wind too favorable! Oh, me! and once again, Oh, me! How my soul is pierced by the stab of these goads and by the memory of sorrows!	ἀδάματόν τε καὶ δυσούριστον ὄν. οἴμοι, οἴμοι μάλʼ αὖθις· οἷον εἰσέδυ μʼ ἅμα κέντρων τε τῶνδʼ οἴστρημα καὶ μνήμη κακῶν.
No wonder that amidst these woes	καὶ θαῦμά γʼ οὐδὲν ἐν τοσοῖσδε πήμασιν
you mourn and bear a double pain.	διπλᾶ σε πενθεῖν καὶ διπλᾶ φορεῖν κακά.
Ah, friend, you still are steadfast in your care for me, and still have patience to tend to the blind man! Ah, me!	ἰὼ φίλος, σὺ μὲν ἐμὸς ἐπίπολος ἔτι μόνιμος· ἔτι γὰρ ὑπομένεις με τὸν τυφλὸν κηδεύων. φεῦ φεῦ.
Your presence is not hidden from me—no, blind though I am, nevertheless I know your voice full well.	οὐ γάρ με λήθεις, ἀλλὰ γιγνώσκω σαφῶς, καίπερ σκοτεινός, τήν γε σὴν αὐδὴν ὅμως.
Man of dread deeds, how could you quench your vision in this way? What divinity urged you on?	ὦ δεινὰ δράσας, πῶς ἔτλης τοιαῦτα σὰς ὄψεις μαρᾶναι; τίς σʼ ἐπῆρε δαιμόνων;
It was Apollo, friends, Apollo who brought these troubles	Ἀπόλλων τάδʼ ἦν, Ἀπόλλων, φίλοι,
to pass, these terrible, terrible troubles. But the hand that struck my eyes was none other than my own, wretched that I am!	ὁ κακὰ κακὰ τελῶν ἐμὰ τάδʼ ἐμὰ πάθεα. ἔπαισε δʼ αὐτόχειρ νιν οὔτις, ἀλλʼ ἐγὼ τλάμων. τί γὰρ ἔδει μʼ ὁρᾶν,
Why should I see, when sight showed me nothing sweet?	ὅτῳ γʼ ὁρῶντι μηδὲν ἦν ἰδεῖν γλυκύ;
These things were just as you say.	ἦν τᾷδʼ ὅπωσπερ καὶ σύ φῄς.
What, my friends, can I behold anymore, what can I love, what greeting can touch my ear with joy? Hurry, friends,	τί δῆτʼ ἐμοὶ βλεπτὸν ἢ στερκτὸν ἢ προσήγορον ἔτʼ ἔστʼ ἀκούειν ἡδονᾷ φίλοι;
lead me from the land, lead me from here, the utterly lost,	ἀπάγετʼ ἐκτόπιον ὅ τι τάχιστά με, ἀπάγετʼ, ὦ φίλοι, τὸν μέγʼ ὀλέθριον τὸν καταρατότατον, ἔτι δὲ καὶ θεοῖς
the thrice-accursed, the mortal most hateful to the gods!	ἐχθρότατον βροτῶν. δείλαιε τοῦ νοῦ τῆς τε συμφορᾶς ἴσον,
Wretched alike for your fortune and for your understanding of it, would that I had never known you!	ὡς σʼ ἠθέλησα μηδέ γʼ ἂν γνῶναί ποτε.
Perish the man, whoever he was, who freed me in the past years from the cruel shackle on my feet—a thankless deed! Had I died then,	ὄλοιθʼ ὅστις ἦν, ὃς ἀγρίας πέδας μονάδʼ ἐπιποδίας ἔλυσʼ μʼ ἀπό τε φόνου ἔρυτο κἀνέσωσεν, οὐδὲν εἰς χάριν πράσσων. τότε γὰρ ἂν θανὼν
I would not have been so sore a grief to my friends and to my own soul.	οὐκ ἦ φίλοισιν οὐδʼ ἐμοὶ τοσόνδʼ ἄχος.
I too would have had it thus.	θέλοντι κἀμοὶ τοῦτʼ ἂν ἦν.
In this way I would not have come to shed my father’s blood, or been known among men as the husband of the woman from whom I was born.	οὔκουν πατρός γʼ ἂν φονεὺς ἦλθον οὐδὲ νυμφίος βροτοῖς ἐκλήθην ὧν ἔφυν ἄπο.
Now I am forsaken by the gods, son of a defiled mother, successor to the bed of the man who gave me my own wretched being:	νῦν δʼ ἄθεος μέν εἰμʼ, ἀνοσίων δὲ παῖς, ὁμολεχὴς δʼ ἀφʼ ὧν αὐτὸς ἔφυν τάλας.
if there is a woe surpassing all woes, it has become Oedipus’ lot.	εἰ δέ τι πρεσβύτερον ἔτι κακοῦ κακόν, τοῦτʼ ἔλαχʼ Οἰδίπους.
I cannot agree that you have counseled well: you would have been better dead than living and blind.	οὐκ οἶδʼ ὅπως σε φῶ βεβουλεῦσθαι καλῶς· κρείσσων γὰρ ἦσθα μηκέτʼ ὢν ἢ ζῶν τυφλός.
Do not tell me that things have not been best done in this way:	ὡς μὲν τάδʼ οὐχ ὧδʼ ἔστʼ ἄριστʼ εἰργασμένα,
give me counsel no more. If I had sight, I know not with what eyes I could even have looked on my father, when I came to the house of Hades, or on my miserable mother, since against both I have sinned such sins as hanging myself could not punish.	μή μʼ ἐκδίδασκε, μηδὲ συμβούλευʼ ἔτι. ἐγὼ γὰρ οὐκ οἶδʼ ὄμμασιν ποίοις βλέπων πατέρα ποτʼ ἂν προσεῖδον εἰς Ἅιδου μολὼν οὐδʼ αὖ τάλαιναν μητέρʼ, οἷν ἐμοὶ δυοῖν ἔργʼ ἐστὶ κρείσσονʼ ἀγχόνης εἰργασμένα.
But do you think that the sight of children, born as mine were, was lovely for me to look upon? No, no, never lovely to my eyes! No, neither was this town with its towering walls, nor the sacred statues of the gods, since I, thrice wretched that I am—	ἀλλʼ ἡ τέκνων δῆτʼ ὄψις ἦν ἐφίμερος, βλαστοῦσʼ ὅπως ἔβλαστε, προσλεύσσειν ἐμοί; οὐ δῆτα τοῖς γʼ ἐμοῖσιν ὀφθαλμοῖς ποτε· οὐδʼ ἄστυ γʼ οὐδὲ πύργος οὐδὲ δαιμόνων ἀγάλμαθʼ ἱερά, τῶν ὁ παντλήμων ἐγὼ
I, noblest of the sons of Thebes—have doomed myself to know them no more by commanding that all should reject the impious one, the one whom the gods have revealed as unholy, a member of Laius’ own race! After bearing such a stain upon myself,	κάλλιστʼ ἀνὴρ εἷς ἔν γε ταῖς Θήβαις τραφεὶς ἀπεστέρησʼ ἐμαυτόν, αὐτὸς ἐννέπων ὠθεῖν ἅπαντας τὸν ἀσεβῆ, τὸν ἐκ θεῶν φανέντʼ ἄναγνον καὶ γένους τοῦ Λαΐου. τοιάνδʼ ἐγὼ κηλῖδα μηνύσας ἐμὴν
was I to look with steady eyes on this folk? No indeed: were there a way to choke the source of hearing, I would not have hesitated to make a fast prison of this wretched frame, so that I should have known neither sight nor sound.	ὀρθοῖς ἔμελλον ὄμμασιν τούτους ὁρᾶν; ἥκιστά γʼ· ἀλλʼ εἰ τῆς ἀκουούσης ἔτʼ ἦν πηγῆς διʼ ὤτων φραγμός, οὐκ ἂν ἐσχόμην τὸ μὴ ἀποκλῇσαι τοὐμὸν ἄθλιον δέμας, ἵνʼ ἦ τυφλός τε καὶ κλύων μηδέν· τὸ γὰρ
It is sweet for our thought to dwell beyond the sphere of grief. Alas, Cithaeron, why did you provide a shelter for me? When I was given to you, why did you not slay me straightway, that I might never reveal my origin to men. Ah, Polybus, ah, Corinth , and you that were called the ancient house of my father,	τὴν φροντίδʼ ἔξω τῶν κακῶν οἰκεῖν γλυκύ. ἰὼ Κιθαιρών, τί μʼ ἐδέχου; τί μʼ οὐ λαβὼν ἔκτεινας εὐθύς, ὡς ἔδειξα μήποτε ἐμαυτὸν ἀνθρώποισιν ἔνθεν ἦ γεγώς; ὦ Πόλυβε καὶ Κόρινθε καὶ τὰ πάτρια
how fair-seeming was I, your nurseling, and what evils were festering underneath! Now I am found to be evil and of evil birth. Oh you three roads, and you secret glen, you, thicket, and narrow way where three paths met—	λόγῳ παλαιὰ δώμαθʼ, οἷον ἆρά με κάλλος κακῶν ὕπουλον ἐξεθρέψατε· νῦν γὰρ κακός τʼ ὢν κἀκ κακῶν εὑρίσκομαι. ὦ τρεῖς κέλευθοι καὶ κεκρυμμένη νάπη δρυμός τε καὶ στενωπὸς ἐν τριπλαῖς ὁδοῖς,
you who drank my father’s blood from my own hands—do you remember, perhaps, what deeds I have performed in your sight, and then what fresh deeds I went on to do when I came here? Oh marriage rites, you gave me birth, and when you had brought me forth,	αἳ τοὐμὸν αἷμα τῶν ἐμῶν χειρῶν ἄπο ἐπίετε πατρός, ἆρά μου μέμνησθʼ ἔτι οἷʼ ἔργα δράσας ὑμὶν εἶτα δεῦρʼ ἰὼν ὁποῖʼ ἔπρασσον αὖθις; ᾧ γάμοι γάμοι, ἐφύσαθʼ ἡμᾶς, καὶ φυτεύσαντες πάλιν
you again bore children to your child, you created an incestuous kinship of fathers, brothers, sons, brides, wives, and mothers—all the foulest deeds that are wrought among men! But it is improper to mention what it is improper to do—	ἀνεῖτε ταὐτοῦ σπέρμα, κἀπεδείξατε πατέρας, ἀδελφούς, παῖδας, αἷμʼ ἐμφύλιον, νύμφας, γυναῖκας μητέρας τε, χὠπόσα αἴσχιστʼ ἐν ἀνθρώποισιν ἔργα γίγνεται. ἀλλʼ οὐ γὰρ αὐδᾶν ἔσθʼ ἃ μηδὲ δρᾶν καλόν,
hurry, for the love of the gods, hide me somewhere beyond the land, or slay me, or cast me into the sea, where you will never behold me any longer! Approach—deign to lay your hands on a wretched man—listen and fear not: my plague can rest	ὅπως τάχιστα πρὸς θεῶν ἔξω μέ που καλύψατʼ ἢ φονεύσατʼ ἢ θαλάσσιον ἐκρίψατʼ, ἔνθα μήποτʼ εἰσόψεσθʼ ἔτι. ἴτʼ, ἀξιώσατʼ ἀνδρὸς ἀθλίου θιγεῖν. πίθεσθε, μὴ δείσητε· τἀμὰ γὰρ κακὰ
on no other mortal.	οὐδεὶς οἷός τε πλὴν ἐμοῦ φέρειν βροτῶν.
But here is Creon in good time to plan and perform that which you request. He alone is left to guard the land in your place.	ἀλλʼ ὧν ἐπαιτεῖς εἰς δέον πάρεσθʼ ὅδε Κρέων τὸ πράσσειν καὶ τὸ βουλεύειν, ἐπεὶ χώρας λέλειπται μοῦνος ἀντὶ σοῦ φύλαξ.
Ah, me, how will I address him?	οἴμοι, τί δῆτα λέξομεν πρὸς τόνδʼ ἔπος;
What claim to credence can be shown on my part? For in the past I proved to be wholly false to him.	τίς μοι φανεῖται πίστις ἔνδικος; τὰ γὰρ πάρος πρὸς αὐτὸν πάντʼ ἐφεύρημαι κακός.
I have not come to mock or reproach you with any any past fault.	οὐχ ὡς γελαστής, Οἰδίπους, ἐλήλυθα, οὐδʼ ὡς ὀνειδιῶν τι τῶν πάρος κακῶν.
But you, if you no longer respect the children of men,	ἀλλʼ εἰ τὰ θνητῶν μὴ καταισχύνεσθʼ ἔτι
revere at least the all-nurturing flame of our lord the Sun, and don’t show so openly such a pollution as this, one which neither earth, nor holy rain, nor the light itself can welcome. Take him into the house as quickly as you can: it best accords with pity that	γένεθλα, τὴν γοῦν πάντα βόσκουσαν φλόγα αἰδεῖσθʼ ἄνακτος Ἡλίου, τοιόνδʼ ἄγος ἀκάλυπτον οὕτω δεικνύναι, τὸ μήτε γῆ μήτʼ ὄμβρος ἱερὸς μήτε φῶς προσδέξεται. ἀλλʼ ὡς τάχιστʼ ἐς οἶκον ἐσκομίζετε·
kinfolk alone should see and hear a kinsman’s woes.	τοῖς ἐν γένει γὰρ τἀγγενῆ μάλισθʼ ὁρᾶν μόνοις τʼ ἀκούειν εὐσεβῶς ἔχει κακά.
For the gods’ love—since you have done a gentle violence to my prediction and come in a spirit so noble to me, a man most vile—grant me a favor: I will speak for your own good, not mine.	πρὸς θεῶν, ἐπείπερ ἐλπίδος μʼ ἀπέσπασας, ἄριστος ἐλθὼν πρὸς κάκιστον ἄνδρʼ ἐμέ, πιθοῦ τί μοι· πρὸς σοῦ γὰρ οὐδʼ ἐμοῦ φράσω.
And what do you wish so eagerly to get from me?	καὶ τοῦ με χρείας ὧδε λιπαρεῖς τυχεῖν;
Cast me out of this land with all speed, to a place where no mortal shall be found to greet me.	ῥῖψόν με γῆς ἐκ τῆσδʼ ὅσον τάχισθʼ, ὅπου θνητῶν φανοῦμαι μηδενὸς προσήγορος.
This I could have done, to be sure, except I craved first to learn from the god all my duty.	ἔδρασʼ ἂν εὖ τοῦτʼ ἴσθʼ ἄν, εἰ μὴ τοῦ θεοῦ πρώτιστʼ ἔχρῃζον ἐκμαθεῖν τί πρακτέαν.
But his pronouncement has been set forth in full—to let me perish, the parricide, unholy one that I am.	ἀλλʼ ἥ γʼ ἐκείνου πᾶσʼ ἐδηλώθη φάτις, τὸν πατροφόντην, τὸν ἀσεβῆ μʼ ἀπολλύναι.
Thus it was said. But since we have come to such a pass, it is better to learn clearly what should be done.	οὕτως ἐλέχθη ταῦθʼ· ὅμως δʼ ἵνʼ ἕσταμεν χρείας, ἄμεινον ἐκμαθεῖν τι δραστέον.
Will you, then, seek a response on behalf of such a wretch as I?	οὕτως ἄρʼ ἀνδρὸς ἀθλίου πεύσεσθʼ ὕπερ;
Yes, for even you yourself will now surely put faith in the god.	καὶ γὰρ σὺ νῦν τἂν τῷ θεῷ πίστιν φέροις.
Yes. And on you I lay this charge, to you I make this entreaty: give to the woman within such burial as you wish—you will properly render the last rites to your own. But never let this city of my father be condemned	καὶ σοί γʼ ἐπισκήπτω τε καὶ προστέψομαι, τῆς μὲν κατʼ οἴκους αὐτὸς ὃν θέλεις τάφον θοῦ· καὶ γὰρ ὀρθῶς τῶν γε σῶν τελεῖς ὕπερ· ἐμοῦ δὲ μήποτʼ ἀξιωθήτω τόδε
to have me dwelling within, as long as I live. No, allow me to live in the hills, where Cithaeron, famed as mine, sits, which my mother and father, while they lived, fixed as my appointed tomb, so that I may die according to the decree of those who sought to slay me.	πατρῷον ἄστυ ζῶντος οἰκητοῦ τυχεῖν, ἀλλʼ ἔα με ναίειν ὄρεσιν, ἔνθα κλῄζεται οὑμὸς Κιθαιρὼν οὗτος, ὃν μήτηρ τέ μοι πατήρ τʼ ἐθέσθην ζῶντε κύριον τάφον, ἵνʼ ἐξ ἐκείνων, οἵ μʼ ἀπωλλύτην, θάνω.
And yet I know this much, that neither sickness nor anything else can destroy me; for I would never have been snatched from death, except in order to suffer some strange doom. But let my fate go where it will. Regarding my children, Creon, I beg you to take no care of my sons:	καίτοι τοσοῦτόν γʼ οἶδα, μήτε μʼ ἂν νόσον μήτʼ ἄλλο πέρσαι μηδέν· οὐ γὰρ ἄν ποτε θνῄσκων ἐσώθην, μὴ ʼπί τῳ δεινῷ κακῷ. ἀλλʼ ἡ μὲν ἡμῶν μοῖρʼ, ὅποιπερ εἶσʼ, ἴτω· παίδων δὲ τῶν μὲν ἀρσένων μή μοι, Κρέων,
they are men, so that they will never lack the means to live wherever they should be. My two girls, poor hapless ones—who never knew my table spread separately, or lacked their father’s presence, but always had a share of all that	προσθῇ μέριμναν· ἄνδρες εἰσίν, ὥστε μὴ σπάνιν ποτὲ σχεῖν, ἔνθʼ ἂν ὦσι, τοῦ βίου· ταῖν δʼ ἀθλίαιν οἰκτραῖν τε παρθένοιν ἐμαῖν, αἷν οὔποθʼ ἡμὴ χωρὶς ἐστάθη βορᾶς τράπεζʼ ἄνευ τοῦδʼ ἀνδρός, ἀλλʼ ὅσων ἐγὼ
reached my hands—I implore you to take care of them. And, if you can, allow me to touch them with my hands, and to indulge my grief. Grant it, prince, grant it, noble heart. Ah, if I could but once touch them with my hands, I would think that I had them	ψαύοιμι, πάντων τῶνδʼ ἀεὶ μετειχέτην· αἷν μοι μέλεσθαι· καὶ μάλιστα μὲν χεροῖν ψαῦσαί μʼ ἔασον κἀποκλαύσασθαι κακά. ἴθʼ ὦναξ, ἴθʼ ὦ γονῇ γενναῖε· χερσί τἂν θιγὼν
just as when I had sight.	δοκοῖμʼ ἔχειν σφᾶς, ὥσπερ ἡνίκʼ ἔβλεπον.
What is this? Oh, gods, can it be my loved ones that I hear sobbing, can Creon have taken pity on me and sent my children, my darlings?	τί φημί; οὐ δὴ κλύω που πρὸς θεῶν τοῖν μοι φίλοιν δακρυρροούντοιν, καί μʼ ἐποικτίρας Κρέων ἔπεμψέ μοι τὰ φίλτατʼ ἐκγόνοιν ἐμοῖν;
Am I right?	λέγω τι;
You are. I have brought this about, for I knew the joy which you have long had from them—the joy you now have.	λέγεις· ἐγὼ γὰρ εἰμʼ ὁ πορσύνας τάδε, γνοὺς τὴν παροῦσαν τέρψιν, ἥ σʼ εἶχεν πάλαι.
Bless you, and for this errand may the god prove a kinder guardian to you than he has to me.	ἀλλʼ εὐτυχοίης, καί σε τῆσδε τῆς ὁδοῦ δαίμων ἄμεινον ἢ ʼμὲ φρουρήσας τύχοι.
My children, where are you? Come, here, here to the hands of the one whose mother was your own, the hands that have made your father’s once bright eyes to be such orbs as these—his, who seeing nothing, knowing nothing,	ὦ τέκνα, ποῦ ποτʼ ἐστέ; δεῦρʼ ἴτʼ, ἔλθετε ὡς τὰς ἀδελφὰς τάσδε τὰς ἐμὰς χέρας, αἳ τοῦ φυτουργοῦ πατρὸς ὑμὶν ὧδʼ ὁρᾶν τὰ πρόσθε λαμπρὰ προυξένησαν ὄμματα· ὃς ὑμίν, ὦ τέκνʼ, οὔθʼ ὁρῶν οὔθʼ ἱστορῶν
became your father by her from whom he was born! For you also do I weep, though I cannot see you, when I think of the bitter life that men will make you live in days to come. To what company of the citizens will you go, to what festival,	πατὴρ ἐφάνθην ἔνθεν αὐτὸς ἠρόθην. καὶ σφὼ δακρύω· προσβλέπειν γὰρ οὐ σθένω· νοούμενος τὰ λοιπὰ τοῦ πικροῦ βίου, οἷον βιῶναι σφὼ πρὸς ἀνθρώπων χρεών. ποίας γὰρ ἀστῶν ἥξετʼ εἰς ὁμιλίας,
from which you will not return home in tears, not sharing in the holiday? But when you reach a ripe age for marriage, who shall he be, who shall be the man, my daughters, to risk taking upon himself the reproaches	ποίας δʼ ἑορτάς, ἔνθεν οὐ κεκλαυμέναι πρὸς οἶκον ἵξεσθʼ ἀντὶ τῆς θεωρίας; ἀλλʼ ἡνίκʼ ἂν δὴ πρὸς γάμων ἥκητʼ ἀκμάς, τίς οὗτος ἔσται, τίς παραρρίψει, τέκνα, τοιαῦτʼ ὀνείδη λαμβάνων, ἃ ταῖς ἐμαῖς
that will certainly be baneful to my offspring and yours? What misery is lacking? Your father killed his own father, and bore you from the source of his own being!	γοναῖσιν ἔσται σφῷν θʼ ὁμοῦ δηλήματα; τί γὰρ κακῶν ἄπεστι; τὸν πατέρα πατὴρ ὑμῶν ἔπεφνε· τὴν τεκοῦσαν ἤροσεν, ὅθεν περ αὐτὸς ἐσπάρη, κἀκ τῶν ἴσων ἐκτήσαθʼ ὑμᾶς, ὧνπερ αὐτὸς ἐξέφυ.
Such are the taunts that will be cast at you. And who then will wed you? The man does not live, no, it cannot be, my children, but you will wither in barren maidenhood. Son of Menoeceus, hear me: since you are the only father left to them—we, their parents, are both gone—	τοιαῦτʼ ὀνειδιεῖσθε· κᾆτα τίς γαμεῖ; οὐκ ἔστιν οὐδείς, ὦ τέκνʼ, ἀλλὰ δηλαδὴ χέρσους φθαρῆναι κἀγάμους ὑμᾶς χρεών. ὦ παῖ Μενοικέως, ἀλλʼ ἐπεὶ μόνος πατὴρ ταύταιν λέλειψαι, νὼ γάρ, ὣ ʼφυτεύσαμεν,
do not allow them to wander poor and unwed, for they are your own kin, nor abase them to the level of my woes. Pity them, seeing them deprived of everything but you at such an age.	ὀλώλαμεν δύʼ ὄντε, μή σφε περιίδῃς πτωχὰς ἀνάνδρους ἐκγενεῖς ἀλωμένας, μηδʼ ἐξισώσῃς τάσδε τοῖς ἐμοῖς κακοῖς. ἀλλʼ οἴκτισόν σφας, ὧδε τηλικάσδʼ ὁρῶν πάντων ἐρήμους, πλὴν ὅσον τὸ σὸν μέρος.
Promise, noble man, and touch them with your hand. To you, children, I would have given much counsel, if your minds were mature. But now pray that you may live where occasion allows, and that the life which is your lot may be happier than your father’s.	ξύννευσον, ὦ γενναῖε, σῇ ψαύσας χερί. σφῷν δʼ, ὦ τέκνʼ, εἰ μὲν εἰχέτην ἤδη φρένας, πόλλʼ ἂν παρῄνουν· νῦν δὲ τοῦτʼ εὔχεσθέ μοι, οὗ καιρὸς ἐᾷ ζῆν, τοῦ βίου δὲ λῴονος ὑμᾶς κυρῆσαι τοῦ φυτεύσαντος πατρός.
Your grief has had a sufficient scope: move on into the house.	ἅλις ἵνʼ ἐξήκεις δακρύων· ἀλλʼ ἴθι στέγης ἔσω.
I must obey, though I do it in no way gladly.	πειστέον, κεἰ μηδὲν ἡδύ.
Yes, for it is in season that all things are good.	πάντα γὰρ καιρῷ καλά.
Do you know on what terms I will go?	οἶσθʼ ἐφʼ οἷς οὖν εἶμι;
You will tell me, and then I will know when I have heard them.	λέξεις, καὶ τότʼ εἴσομαι κλύων.
See that you send me to dwell outside this land.	γῆς μʼ ὅπως πέμψεις ἄποικον.
You ask for what the god must give.	τοῦ θεοῦ μʼ αἰτεῖς δόσιν.
But to the gods I have become most hateful.	ἀλλὰ θεοῖς γʼ ἔχθιστος ἥκω.
Then you will quickly get your wish.	τοιγαροῦν τεύξει τάχα.
So you consent?	φῂς τάδʼ οὖν;
It is not my way to say idly what I do not mean.	ἃ μὴ φρονῶ γὰρ οὐ φιλῶ λέγειν μάτην.
Then it is time to lead me away.	ἄπαγέ νύν μʼ ἐντεῦθεν ἤδη.
Come, then, but let your children go.	στεῖχέ νυν, τέκνων δʼ ἀφοῦ.
No, do not take them from me!	μηδαμῶς ταύτας γʼ ἕλῃ μου. πάντα μὴ βούλου κρατεῖν·
Do not wish to be master in all things: the mastery which you did attain has not followed you through life.	καὶ γὰρ ἁκράτησας οὔ σοι τῷ βίῳ ξυνέσπετο.
Residents of our native Thebes , behold, this is Oedipus,	ὦ πάτρας Θήβης ἔνοικοι, λεύσσετʼ, Οἰδίπους ὅδε,
who knew the renowned riddle, and was a most mighty man. What citizen did not gaze on his fortune with envy? See into what a stormy sea of troubles he has come! Therefore, while our eyes wait to see the final destined day, we must call no mortal happy until	ὃς τὰ κλείνʼ αἰνίγματʼ ᾔδει καὶ κράτιστος ἦν ἀνήρ, οὗ τίς οὐ ζήλῳ πολιτῶν ἦν τύχαις ἐπιβλέπων, εἰς ὅσον κλύδωνα δεινῆς συμφορᾶς ἐλήλυθεν. ὥστε θνητὸν ὄντα κείνην τὴν τελευταίαν ἰδεῖν ἡμέραν ἐπισκοποῦντα μηδένʼ ὀλβίζειν, πρὶν ἂν
he has crossed life’s border free from pain.	τέρμα τοῦ βίου περάσῃ μηδὲν ἀλγεινὸν παθών.
Ah me! Ah me! O King Jupiter, of what a terrible length the nights are! Will it never be day? And yet long since I heard the cock. My domestics are snoring; but they would not have done so heretofore! May you perish then, O war! For many reasons; because I may not even punish my domestics. Neither does this excellent youth awake through the night; but takes his ease, wrapped up in five blankets. Well, if it is the fashion, let us snore wrapped up. But I am not able, miserable man, to sleep, being tormented by my expenses, and my stud of horses, and my debts, through this son of mine. He with his long hair, is riding horses and driving curricles, and dreaming of horses; while I am driven to distraction, as I see the moon bringing on the twentieths; for the interest is running on. Boy! Light a lamp, and bring forth my tablets, that I may take them and read to how many I am indebted, and calculate the interest. Come, let me see; what do I owe? Twelve minae to Pasias. Why twelve minae to Pasias? Why did I borrow them? When I bought the blood-horse. Ah me, unhappy! Would that it had had its eye knocked out with a stone first!	ἰοὺ ἰού· ὦ Ζεῦ βασιλεῦ τὸ χρῆμα τῶν νυκτῶν ὅσον· ἀπέραντον. οὐδέποθʼ ἡμέρα γενήσεται; καὶ μὴν πάλαι γʼ ἀλεκτρυόνος ἤκουσʼ ἐγώ· οἱ δʼ οἰκέται ῥέγκουσιν· ἀλλʼ οὐκ ἂν πρὸ τοῦ. ἀπόλοιο δῆτʼ ὦ πόλεμε πολλῶν οὕνεκα, ὅτʼ οὐδὲ κολάσʼ ἔξεστί μοι τοὺς οἰκέτας. ἀλλʼ οὐδʼ ὁ χρηστὸς οὑτοσὶ νεανίας ἐγείρεται τῆς νυκτός, ἀλλὰ πέρδεται ἐν πέντε σισύραις ἐγκεκορδυλημένος. ἀλλʼ εἰ δοκεῖ ῥέγκωμεν ἐγκεκαλυμμένοι. ἀλλʼ οὐ δύναμαι δείλαιος εὕδειν δακνόμενος ὑπὸ τῆς δαπάνης καὶ τῆς φάτνης καὶ τῶν χρεῶν διὰ τουτονὶ τὸν υἱόν. ὁ δὲ κόμην ἔχων ἱππάζεταί τε καὶ ξυνωρικεύεται ὀνειροπολεῖ θʼ ἵππους· ἐγὼ δʼ ἀπόλλυμαι ὁρῶν ἄγουσαν τὴν σελήνην εἰκάδας· οἱ γὰρ τόκοι χωροῦσιν. ἅπτε παῖ λύχνον, κἄκφερε τὸ γραμματεῖον, ἵνʼ ἀναγνῶ λαβὼν ὁπόσοις ὀφείλω καὶ λογίσωμαι τοὺς τόκους. φέρʼ ἴδω τί ὀφείλω; δώδεκα μνᾶς Πασίᾳ. τοῦ δώδεκα μνᾶς Πασίᾳ; τί ἐχρησάμην; ὅτʼ ἐπριάμην τὸν κοππατίαν. οἴμοι τάλας, εἴθʼ ἐξεκόπην πρότερον τὸν ὀφθαλμὸν λίθῳ.
You are acting unfairly, Philo! Drive on your own course. This is the bane that has destroyed me; for even in his sleep he dreams about horsemanship. How many courses will the war-chariots run? Many courses do you drive me, your father. But what debt came upon me after Pasias? Three minae to Amynias for a little chariot and pair of wheels. Lead the horse home, after having given him a good rolling. O foolish youth, you have rolled me out of my possessions; since I have been cast in suits, and others say that they will have surety given them for the interest. Pray, father, why are you peevish, and toss about the whole night? A bailiff out of the bedclothes is biting me. Suffer me, good sir, to sleep a little. Then, do you sleep on; but know that all these debts will turn on your head. Alas! Would that the match-maker had perished miserably, who induced me to marry your mother. For a country life used to be most agreeable to me, dirty, untrimmed, reclining at random, abounding in bees, and sheep, and oil-cake. Then I, a rustic, married a niece of Megacles, the son of Megacles, from the city, haughty, luxurious, and Coesyrafied. When I married her, I lay with her redolent of new wine, of the cheese-crate, and abundance of wool; but she, on the contrary, of ointment, saffron, wanton-kisses, extravagance, gluttony, and of Colias and Genetyllis. I will not indeed say that she was idle; but she wove. And I used to show her this cloak by way of a pretext and say Wife, you weave at a great rate.	Φίλων ἀδικεῖς· ἔλαυνε τὸν σαυτοῦ δρόμον. τοῦτʼ ἔστι τουτὶ τὸ κακὸν ὅ μʼ ἀπολώλεκεν· ὀνειροπολεῖ γὰρ καὶ καθεύδων ἱππικήν. πόσους δρόμους ἐλᾷ τὰ πολεμιστήρια; ἐμὲ μὲν σὺ πολλοὺς τὸν πατέρʼ ἐλαύνεις δρόμους. ἀτὰρ τί χρέος ἔβα με μετὰ τὸν Πασίαν; τρεῖς μναῖ διφρίσκου καὶ τροχοῖν Ἀμυνίᾳ. ἄπαγε τὸν ἵππον ἐξαλίσας οἴκαδε. ἀλλʼ ὦ μέλʼ ἐξήλικας ἐμέ γʼ ἐκ τῶν ἐμῶν, ὅτε καὶ δίκας ὤφληκα χἄτεροι τόκου ἐνεχυράσεσθαί φασιν. ἐτεὸν ὦ πάτερ τί δυσκολαίνεις καὶ στρέφει τὴν νύχθʼ ὅλην; δάκνει μὲ δήμαρχός τις ἐκ τῶν στρωμάτων. ἔασον ὦ δαιμόνιε καταδαρθεῖν τί με. σὺ δʼ οὖν κάθευδε· τὰ δὲ χρέα ταῦτʼ ἴσθʼ ὅτι ἐς τὴν κεφαλὴν ἅπαντα τὴν σὴν τρέψεται. φεῦ. εἴθʼ ὤφελʼ ἡ προμνήστριʼ ἀπολέσθαι κακῶς, ἥτις με γῆμʼ ἐπῆρε τὴν σὴν μητέρα· ἐμοὶ γὰρ ἦν ἄγροικος ἥδιστος βίος εὐρωτιῶν, ἀκόρητος, εἰκῇ κείμενος, βρύων μελίτταις καὶ προβάτοις καὶ στεμφύλοις. ἔπειτʼ ἔγημα Μεγακλέους τοῦ Μεγακλέους ἀδελφιδῆν ἄγροικος ὢν ἐξ ἄστεως, σεμνὴν τρυφῶσαν ἐγκεκοισυρωμένην. ταύτην ὅτʼ ἐγάμουν, συγκατεκλινόμην ἐγὼ ὄζων τρυγὸς τρασιᾶς ἐρίων περιουσίας, ἡ δʼ αὖ μύρου κρόκου καταγλωττισμάτων, δαπάνης λαφυγμοῦ Κωλιάδος Γενετυλλίδος. οὐ μὴν ἐρῶ γʼ ὡς ἀργὸς ἦν, ἀλλʼ ἐσπάθα. ἐγὼ δʼ ἂν αὐτῇ θοἰμάτιον δεικνὺς τοδὶ πρόφασιν ἔφασκον, ὦ γύναι λίαν σπαθᾷς.
We have no oil in the lamp. Ah me! Why did you light the thirsty lamp? Come hither that you may weep! For what, pray, shall I weep? Because you put in one of the thick wicks. After this, when this son was born to us, to me, forsooth, and to my excellent wife, we squabbled then about the name: for she was for adding hippos to the name, Xanthippus, or Charippus, or Callipides; but I was for giving him the name of his grandfather, Phidonides. For a time therefore we disputed; and then at length we agreed, and called him Phidippides. She used to take this son and fondle him, saying, When you, being grown up, shall drive your chariot to the city, like Megacles, with a xystis. But I used to say, Nay, rather, when dressed in a leathern jerkin, you shall drive goats from Phelleus, like your father. He paid no attention to my words, but poured a horse-fever over my property. Now, therefore, by meditating the whole night, I have discovered one path for my course extraordinarily excellent; to which if I persuade this youth I shall be saved. But first I wish to awake him. How then can I awake him in the most agreeable manner? How? Phidippides, my little Phidippides? What, father? Kiss me, and give me your right hand! There. What's the matter? Tell me, do you love me? Yes, by this Equestrian Neptune. Nay, do not by any means mention this Equestrian to me, for this god is the author of my misfortunes. But, if you really love me from your heart, my son, obey me. In what then, pray, shall I obey you? Reform your habits as quickly as possible, and go and learn what I advise.	ἔλαιον ἡμῖν οὐκ ἔνεστʼ ἐν τῷ λύχνῳ. οἴμοι· τί γάρ μοι τὸν πότην ἧπτες λύχνον; δεῦρʼ ἔλθʼ ἵνα κλάῃς. διὰ τί δῆτα κλαύσομαι; ὅτι τῶν παχειῶν ἐνετίθεις θρυαλλίδων. μετὰ ταῦθʼ, ὅπως νῷν ἐγένεθʼ υἱὸς οὑτοσί, ἐμοί τε δὴ καὶ τῇ γυναικὶ τἀγαθῇ, περὶ τοὐνόματος δὴ ʼντεῦθεν ἐλοιδορούμεθα· ἡ μὲν γὰρ ἵππον προσετίθει πρὸς τοὔνομα, Ξάνθιππον ἤ Χαριππον ἢ Καλλιππίδην, ἐγὼ δὲ τοῦ πάππου ʼτιθέμην Φειδωνίδην. τέως μὲν οὖν ἐκρινόμεθʼ· εἶτα τῷ χρόνῳ κοινῇ ξυνέβημεν κἀθέμεθα Φειδιππίδην. τοῦτον τὸν υἱὸν λαμβάνουσʼ ἐκορίζετο, ὅταν σὺ μέγας ὢν ἅρμʼ ἐλαύνῃς πρὸς πόλιν, ὥσπερ Μεγακλέης, ξυστίδʼ ἔχων. ἐγὼ δʼ ἔφην, ὅταν μὲν οὖν τὰς αἶγας ἐκ τοῦ φελλέως, ὥσπερ ὁ πατήρ σου, διφθέραν ἐνημμένος. ἀλλʼ οὐκ ἐπίθετο τοῖς ἐμοῖς οὐδὲν λόγοις, ἀλλʼ ἵππερόν μου κατέχεεν τῶν χρημάτων. νῦν οὖν ὅλην τὴν νύκτα φροντίζων ὁδοῦ μίαν ηὗρον ἀτραπὸν δαιμονίως ὑπερφυᾶ, ἣν ἢν ἀναπείσω τουτονί, σωθήσομαι. ἀλλʼ ἐξεγεῖραι πρῶτον αὐτὸν βούλομαι. πῶς δῆτʼ ἂν ἥδιστʼ αὐτὸν ἐπεγείραιμι; πῶς; Φειδιππίδη Φειδιππίδιον. τί ὦ πάτερ; κύσον με καὶ τὴν χεῖρα δὸς τὴν δεξιάν. ἰδού. τί ἔστιν; εἰπέ μοι, φιλεῖς ἐμέ; νὴ τὸν Ποσειδῶ τουτονὶ τὸν ἵππιον. μὴ ʼμοί γε τοῦτον μηδαμῶς τὸν ἵππιον· οὗτος γὰρ ὁ θεὸς αἴτιός μοι τῶν κακῶν. ἀλλʼ εἴπερ ἐκ τῆς καρδίας μʼ ὄντως φιλεῖς, ὦ παῖ πιθοῦ. τί οὖν πίθωμαι δῆτά σοι; ἔκστρεψον ὡς τάχιστα τοὺς σαυτοῦ τρόπους, καὶ μάνθανʼ ἐλθὼν ἃν ἐγὼ παραινέσω.
Tell me now, what do you prescribe? And will you obey me at all? By Bacchus, I will obey you. Look this way then! Do you see this little door and little house? I see it. What then, pray, is this, father? This is a thinking-shop of wise spirits. There dwell men who in speaking of the heavens persuade people that it is an oven, and that it encompasses us, and that we are the embers. These men teach, if one give them money, to conquer in speaking, right or wrong. Who are they? I do not know the name accurately. They are minute philosophers, noble and excellent. Bah! They are rogues; I know them. You mean the quacks, the pale-faced wretches, the bare-footed fellows, of whose numbers are the miserable Socrates and Chaerephon. Hold! Hold! Be silent! Do not say anything foolish. But, if you have any concern for your father's patrimony, become one of them, having given up your horsemanship. I would not, by Bacchus, even if you were to give me the pheasants which Leogoras rears! Go, I entreat you, dearest of men, go and be taught. Why, what shall I learn? They say that among them are both the two causes--the better cause, whichever that is, and the worse: they say that the one of these two causes, the worse, prevails, though it speaks on the unjust side. If, therefore you learn for me this unjust cause, I would not pay any one, not even an obolus of these debts, which I owe at present on your account. I can not comply; for I should not dare to look upon the knights, having lost all my colour. Then, by Ceres, you shall not eat any of my good! Neither you, nor your blood-horse; but I will drive you out of my house to the crows. My uncle Megacles will not permit me to be without a horse. But I'll go in, and pay no heed to you. Though fallen, still I will not lie prostrate: but having prayed to the gods, I will go myself to the thinking-shop and get taught. How, then, being an old man, shall I learn the subtleties of refined disquisitions? I must go. Why thus do I loiter and not knock at the door? Boy! Little boy!	λέγε δή, τί κελεύεις; καί τι πείσει; πείσομαι νὴ τὸν Διόνυσον. δεῦρό νυν ἀπόβλεπε. ὁρᾷς τὸ θύριον τοῦτο καὶ τᾠκίδιον; ὁρῶ. τί οὖν τοῦτʼ ἐστὶν ἐτεὸν ὦ πάτερ; ψυχῶν σοφῶν τοῦτʼ ἐστὶ φροντιστήριον. ἐνταῦθʼ ἐνοικοῦσʼ ἄνδρες, οἳ τὸν οὐρανὸν λέγοντες ἀναπείθουσιν ὡς ἔστιν πνιγεύς, κἄστιν περὶ ἡμᾶς οὗτος, ἡμεῖς δʼ ἄνθρακες. οὗτοι διδάσκουσʼ, ἀργύριον ἤν τις διδῷ, λέγοντα νικᾶν καὶ δίκαια κἄδικα. εἰσὶν δὲ τίνες; οὐκ οἶδʼ ἀκριβῶς τοὔνομα· μεριμνοφροντισταὶ καλοί τε κἀγαθοί. αἰβοῖ πονηροί γʼ, οἶδα. τοὺς ἀλαζόνας τοὺς ὠχριῶντας τοὺς ἀνυποδήτους λέγεις, ὧν ὁ κακοδαίμων Σωκράτης καὶ Χαιρεφῶν. ἢ ἢ σιώπα· μηδὲν εἴπῃς νήπιον. ἀλλʼ εἴ τι κήδει τῶν πατρῴων ἀλφίτων, τούτων γενοῦ μοι σχασάμενος τὴν ἱππικήν. οὐκ ἂν μὰ τὸν Διόνυσον, εἰ δοίης γέ μοι τοὺς φασιανοὺς οὓς τρέφει Λεωγόρας. ἴθʼ ἀντιβολῶ σʼ ὦ φίλτατʼ ἀνθρώπων ἐμοὶ ἐλθὼν διδάσκου. καὶ τί σοι μαθήσομαι; εἶναι παρʼ αὐτοῖς φασιν ἄμφω τὼ λόγω, τὸν κρείττονʼ, ὅστις ἐστί, καὶ τὸν ἥττονα. τούτοιν τὸν ἕτερον τοῖν λόγοιν, τὸν ἥττονα, νικᾶν λέγοντά φασι τἀδικώτερα. ἢν οὖν μάθῃς μοι τὸν ἄδικον τοῦτον λόγον, ἃ νῦν ὀφείλω διὰ σέ, τούτων τῶν χρεῶν οὐκ ἂν ἀποδοίην οὐδʼ ἂν ὀβολὸν οὐδενί. οὐκ ἂν πιθοίμην· οὐ γὰρ ἂν τλαίην ἰδεῖν τοὺς ἱππέας τὸ χρῶμα διακεκναισμένος. οὐκ ἄρα μὰ τὴν Δήμητρα τῶν γʼ ἐμῶν ἔδει, οὔτʼ αὐτὸς οὔθʼ ὁ ζύγιος οὔθʼ ὁ σαμφόρας· ἀλλʼ ἐξελῶ σʼ ἐς κόρακας ἐκ τῆς οἰκίας. ἀλλʼ οὐ περιόψεταί μʼ ὁ θεῖος Μεγακλέης ἄνιππον. ἀλλʼ εἴσειμι, σοῦ δʼ οὐ φροντιῶ. ἀλλʼ οὐδʼ ἐγὼ μέντοι πεσών γε κείσομαι, ἀλλʼ εὐξάμενος τοῖσιν θεοῖς διδάξομαι αὐτὸς βαδίζων ἐς τὸ φροντιστήριον. πῶς οὖν γέρων ὢν κἀπιλήσμων καὶ βραδὺς λόγων ἀκριβῶν σχινδαλάμους μαθήσομαι; ἰτητέον. τί ταῦτʼ ἔχων στραγγεύομαι, ἀλλʼ οὐχὶ κόπτω τὴν θύραν; παῖ παιδίον.
Go to the devil! Who it is that knocked at the door? Strepsiades, the son of Phidon, of Cicynna. You are a stupid fellow, by Jove! who have kicked against the door so very carelessly, and have caused the miscarriage of an idea which I had conceived. Pardon me; for I dwell afar in the country. But tell me the thing which has been made to miscarry. It is not lawful to mention it, except to disciples. Tell it, then, to me without fear; for I here am come as a disciple to the thinking-shop. I will tell you; but you must regard these as mysteries. Socrates lately asked Chaerephon about a flea, how many of its own feet it jumped; for after having bit the eyebrow of Chaerephon, it leaped away onto the head of Socrates. How then did he measure this? Most cleverly. He melted some wax; and then took the flea and dipped its feet in the wax; and then a pair of Persian slippers stuck to it when cooled. Having gently loosened these, he measured back the distance. O King Jupiter! What subtlety of thought! What then would you say if you heard another contrivance of Socrates? Of what kind? Tell me, I beseech you! Chaerephon the Sphettian asked him whether he thought gnats buzzed through the mouth or the breech. What, then, did he say about the gnat? He said the intestine of the gnat was narrow and that the wind went forcibly through it, being slender, straight to the breech; and then that the rump, being hollow where it is adjacent to the narrow part, resounded through the violence of the wind. The rump of the gnats then is a trumpet! Oh, thrice happy he for his sharp-sightedness! Surely a defendant might easily get acquitted who understands the intestine of the gnat. But he was lately deprived of a great idea by a lizard. In what way? Tell me. As he was investigating the courses of the moon and her revolutions, then as he was gaping upward a lizard in the darkness dropped upon him from the roof. I am amused at a lizard's having dropped on Socrates. Yesterday evening there was no supper for us. Well. What then did he contrive for provisions? He sprinkled fine ashes on the table, and bent a little spit, and then took it as a pair of compasses and filched a cloak from the Palaestra.	βάλλʼ ἐς κόρακας· τίς ἐσθʼ ὁ κόψας τὴν θύραν; Φείδωνος υἱὸς Στρεψιάδης Κικυννόθεν. ἀμαθής γε νὴ Δίʼ ὅστις οὑτωσὶ σφόδρα ἀπεριμερίμνως τὴν θύραν λελάκτικας καὶ φροντίδʼ ἐξήμβλωκας ἐξηυρημένην. σύγγνωθί μοι· τηλοῦ γὰρ οἰκῶ τῶν ἀγρῶν. ἀλλʼ εἰπέ μοι τὸ πρᾶγμα τοὐξημβλωμένον. ἀλλʼ οὐ θέμις πλὴν τοῖς μαθηταῖσιν λέγειν. λέγε νυν ἐμοὶ θαρρῶν· ἐγὼ γὰρ οὑτοσὶ ἥκω μαθητὴς ἐς τὸ φροντιστήριον. λέξω. νομίσαι δὲ ταῦτα χρὴ μυστήρια. ἀνήρετʼ ἄρτι Χαιρεφῶντα Σωκράτης ψύλλαν ὁπόσους ἅλλοιτο τοὺς αὑτῆς πόδας· δακοῦσα γὰρ τοῦ Χαιρεφῶντος τὴν ὀφρῦν ἐπὶ τὴν κεφαλὴν τὴν Σωκράτους ἀφήλατο. πῶς δῆτα διεμέτρησε; δεξιώτατα. κηρὸν διατήξας, εἶτα τὴν ψύλλαν λαβὼν ἐνέβαψεν ἐς τὸν κηρὸν αὐτῆς τὼ πόδε, κᾆτα ψυχείσῃ περιέφυσαν Περσικαί. ταύτας ὑπολύσας ἀνεμέτρει τὸ χωρίον. ὦ Ζεῦ βασιλεῦ τῆς λεπτότητος τῶν φρενῶν. τί δῆτʼ ἂν ἕτερον εἰ πύθοιο Σωκράτους φρόντισμα; ποῖον; ἀντιβολῶ κάτειπέ μοι. ἀνήρετʼ αὐτὸν Χαιρεφῶν ὁ Σφήττιος ὁπότερα τὴν γνώμην ἔχοι, τὰς ἐμπίδας κατὰ τὸ στόμʼ ᾄδειν ἢ κατὰ τοὐρροπύγιον. τί δῆτʼ ἐκεῖνος εἶπε περὶ τῆς ἐμπίδος; ἔφασκεν εἶναι τοὔντερον τῆς ἐμπίδος στενόν· διὰ λεπτοῦ δʼ ὄντος αὐτοῦ τὴν πνοὴν βίᾳ βαδίζειν εὐθὺ τοὐρροπυγίου· ἔπειτα κοῖλον πρὸς στενῷ προσκείμενον τὸν πρωκτὸν ἠχεῖν ὑπὸ βίας τοῦ πνεύματος. σάλπιγξ ὁ πρωκτός ἐστιν ἄρα τῶν ἐμπίδων. ὦ τρισμακάριος τοῦ διεντερεύματος. ἦ ῥᾳδίως φεύγων ἂν ἀποφύγοι δίκην ὅστις δίοιδε τοὔντερον τῆς ἐμπίδος. πρώην δέ γε γνώμην μεγάλην ἀφῃρέθη ὑπʼ ἀσκαλαβώτου. τίνα τρόπον; κάτειπέ μοι. ζητοῦντος αὐτοῦ τῆς σελήνης τὰς ὁδοὺς καὶ τὰς περιφορὰς εἶτʼ ἄνω κεχηνότος ἀπὸ τῆς ὀροφῆς νύκτωρ γαλεώτης κατέχεσεν. ἥσθην γαλεώτῃ καταχέσαντι Σωκράτους. ἐχθὲς δέ γʼ ἡμῖν δεῖπνον οὐκ ἦν ἑσπέρας. εἶεν· τί οὖν πρὸς τἄλφιτʼ ἐπαλαμήσατο; κατὰ τῆς τραπέζης καταπάσας λεπτὴν τέφραν κάμψας ὀβελίσκον εἶτα διαβήτην λαβὼν ἐκ τῆς παλαίστρας θοἰμάτιον ὑφείλετο.
Why then do we admire Thales? Open open quickly the thinking-shop, and show to me Socrates as quickly as possible. For I desire to be a disciple. Come, open the door. O Hercules, from what country are these wild beasts? What do you wonder at? To what do they seem to you to be like? To the Spartans who were taken at Pylos . But why in the world do these look upon the ground? They are in search of the things below the earth. Then they are searching for roots. Do not, then, trouble yourselves about this; for I know where there are large and fine ones. Why, what are these doing, who are bent down so much? These are groping about in darkness under Tartarus. Why then does their rump look toward heaven? It is getting taught astronomy alone by itself. But go in, lest he meet with us. Not yet, not yet; but let them remain, that I may communicate to them a little matter of my own. It is not permitted to them to remain without in the open air for a very long time. (discovering a variety of mathematical instruments) Why, what is this, in the name of heaven? Tell me. This is Astronomy. But what is this? Geometry. What then is the use of this? To measure out the land. What belongs to an allotment? No, but the whole earth. You tell me a clever notion; for the contrivance is democratic and useful. See, here's a map of the whole earth. Do you see? This is Athens . What say you? I don't believe you; for I do not see the Dicasts sitting. Be assured that this is truly the Attic territory. Why, where are my fellow-tribesmen of Cicynna? Here they are. And Euboea here, as you see, is stretched out a long way by the side of it to a great distance. I know that; for it was stretched by us and Pericles. But where is Lacedaemon ? Where is it? Here it is. How near it is to us! Pay great attention to this, to remove it very far from us. By Jupiter, it is not possible. Then you will weep for it. Come, who is this man who is in the basket? Himself. Who's Himself ? Socrates. O Socrates! Come, you sir, call upon him loudly for me. Nay, rather, call him yourself; for I have no leisure.	τί δῆτʼ ἐκεῖνον τὸν Θαλῆν θαυμάζομεν; ἄνοιγʼ ἄνοιγʼ ἀνύσας τὸ φροντιστήριον, καὶ δεῖξον ὡς τάχιστά μοι τὸν Σωκράτη. μαθητιῶ γάρ· ἀλλʼ ἄνοιγε τὴν θύραν. ὦ Ἡράκλεις ταυτὶ ποδαπὰ τὰ θηρία; τί ἐθαύμασας; τῷ σοι δοκοῦσιν εἰκέναι; τοῖς ἐκ Πύλου ληφθεῖσι τοῖς Λακωνικοῖς. ἀτὰρ τί ποτʼ ἐς τὴν γῆν βλέπουσιν οὑτοιί; ζητοῦσιν οὗτοι τὰ κατὰ γῆς. βολβοὺς ἄρα ζητοῦσι. μή νυν τουτογὶ φροντίζετε· ἐγὼ γὰρ οἶδʼ ἵνʼ εἰσὶ μεγάλοι καὶ καλοί. τί γὰρ οἵδε δρῶσιν οἱ σφόδρʼ ἐγκεκυφότες; οὗτοι δʼ ἐρεβοδιφῶσιν ὑπὸ τὸν Τάρταρον. τί δῆθʼ ὁ πρωκτὸς ἐς τὸν οὐρανὸν βλέπει; αὐτὸς καθʼ αὑτὸν ἀστρονομεῖν διδάσκεται. ἀλλʼ εἴσιθʼ, ἵνα μὴ ʼκεῖνος ὑμῖν ἐπιτύχῃ. μήπω γε μήπω γʼ· ἀλλʼ ἐπιμεινάντων, ἵνα αὐτοῖσι κοινώσω τι πραγμάτιον ἐμόν. ἀλλʼ οὐχ οἷόν τʼ αὐτοῖσι πρὸς τὸν ἀέρα ἔξω διατρίβειν πολὺν ἄγαν ἐστὶν χρόνον. πρὸς τῶν θεῶν τί γὰρ τάδʼ ἐστίν; εἰπέ μοι. ἀστρονομία μὲν αὑτηί. τουτὶ δὲ τί; γεωμετρία. τοῦτʼ οὖν τί ἐστι χρήσιμον; γῆν ἀναμετρῆσαι. πότερα τὴν κληρουχικήν; οὔκ, ἀλλὰ τὴν σύμπασαν. ἀστεῖον λέγεις. τὸ γὰρ σόφισμα δημοτικὸν καὶ χρήσιμον. αὕτη δέ σοι γῆς περίοδος πάσης. ὁρᾷς; αἵδε μὲν Ἀθῆναι. τί σὺ λέγεις; οὐ πείθομαι, ἐπεὶ δικαστὰς οὐχ ὁρῶ καθημένους. ὡς τοῦτʼ ἀληθῶς Ἀττικὸν τὸ χωρίον. καὶ ποῦ Κικυννῆς εἰσὶν οὑμοὶ δημόται; ἐνταῦθʼ ἔνεισιν. ἡ δέ γʼ Εὔβοἰ, ὡς ὁρᾷς, ἡδὶ παρατέταται μακρὰ πόρρω πάνυ. οἶδʼ· ὑπὸ γὰρ ἡμῶν παρετάθη καὶ Περικλέους. ἀλλʼ ἡ Λακεδαίμων ποῦ ʼσθʼ; ὅπου ʼστίν; αὑτηί. ὡς ἐγγὺς ἡμῶν. τοῦτο πάνυ φροντίζετε, ταύτην ἀφʼ ἡμῶν ἀπαγαγεῖν πόρρω πάνυ. ἀλλʼ οὐχ οἷόν τε. νὴ Δίʼ οἰμώξεσθʼ ἄρα. φέρε τίς γὰρ οὗτος οὑπὶ τῆς κρεμάθρας ἀνήρ; αὐτός. τίς αὐτός; Σωκράτης. ὦ Σώκρατες. ἴθʼ οὗτος, ἀναβόησον αὐτόν μοι μέγα. αὐτὸς μὲν οὖν σὺ κάλεσον· οὐ γάρ μοι σχολή.
Socrates! My little Socrates! Why callest thou me, thou creature of a day? First tell me, I beseech you, what are you doing. I am walking in the air, and speculating about the sun. And so you look down upon the gods from your basket, and not from the earth? For I should not have rightly discovered things celestial if I had not suspended the intellect, and mixed the thought in a subtle form with its kindred air. But if, being on the ground, I speculated from below on things above, I should never have discovered them. For the earth forcibly attracts to itself the meditative moisture. Water-cresses also suffer the very same thing. What do you say? Does meditation attract the moisture to the water-cresses? Come then, my little Socrates, descend to me, that you may teach me those things, for the sake of which I have come. And for what did you come? Wishing to learn to speak; for by reason of usury, and most ill-natured creditors, I am pillaged and plundered, and have my goods seized for debt. How did you get in debt without observing it? A horse-disease consumed me--terrible at eating. But teach me the other one of your two causes, that which pays nothing; and I will swear by the gods, I will pay down to you whatever reward you exact of me. By what gods will you swear? For, in the first place, gods are not a current coin with us. By what do you swear? By iron money, as in Byzantium ? Do you wish to know clearly celestial matters, what they rightly are? Yes, by Jupiter, if it be possible! And to hold converse with the Clouds, our divinities? By all means. Seat yourself, then, upon the sacred couch. Well, I am seated! Take, then, this chaplet. For what purpose a chaplet? Ah me! Socrates, see that you do not sacrifice me like Athamas! No; we do all these to those who get initiated. Then what shall I gain, pray? You shall become in oratory a tricky knave, a thorough rattle, a subtle speaker. But keep quiet.	ὦ Σώκρατες, ὦ Σωκρατίδιον. τί με καλεῖς ὦφήμερε; πρῶτον μὲν ὅ τι δρᾷς ἀντιβολῶ κάτειπέ μοι. ἀεροβατῶ καὶ περιφρονῶ τὸν ἥλιον. ἔπειτʼ ἀπὸ ταρροῦ τοὺς θεοὺς ὑπερφρονεῖς, ἀλλʼ οὐκ ἀπὸ τῆς γῆς, εἴπερ; οὐ γὰρ ἄν ποτε ἐξηῦρον ὀρθῶς τὰ μετέωρα πράγματα, εἰ μὴ κρεμάσας τὸ νόημα καὶ τὴν φροντίδα λεπτὴν καταμείξας ἐς τὸν ὅμοιον ἀέρα. εἰ δʼ ὢν χαμαὶ τἄνω κάτωθεν ἐσκόπουν, οὐκ ἄν ποθʼ ηὗρον· οὐ γὰρ ἀλλʼ ἡ γῆ βίᾳ ἕλκει πρὸς αὑτὴν τὴν ἰκμάδα τῆς φροντίδος. πάσχει δὲ ταὐτὸ τοῦτο καὶ τὰ κάρδαμα. τί φῄς; ἡ φροντὶς ἕλκει τὴν ἰκμάδʼ ἐς τὰ κάρδαμα; ἴθι νυν κατάβηθʼ ὦ Σωκρατίδιον ὡς ἐμέ, ἵνα με διδάξῃς ὧνπερ οὕνεκʼ ἐλήλυθα. ἦλθες δὲ κατὰ τί; βουλόμενος μαθεῖν λέγειν. ὑπὸ γὰρ τόκων χρήστων τε δυσκολωτάτων ἄγομαι φέρομαι, τὰ χρήματʼ ἐνεχυράζομαι. πόθεν δʼ ὑπόχρεως σαυτὸν ἔλαθες γενόμενος; νόσος μʼ ἐπέτριψεν ἱππικὴ δεινὴ φαγεῖν. ἀλλά με δίδαξον τὸν ἕτερον τοῖν σοῖν λόγοιν, τὸν μηδὲν ἀποδιδόντα. μισθὸν δʼ ὅντινʼ ἂν πράττῃ μʼ ὀμοῦμαί σοι καταθήσειν τοὺς θεούς. ποίους θεοὺς ὀμεῖ σύ; πρῶτον γὰρ θεοὶ ἡμῖν νόμισμʼ οὐκ ἔστι. τῷ γὰρ ὄμνυτʼ; ἢ σιδαρέοισιν ὥσπερ ἐν Βυζαντίῳ; βούλει τὰ θεῖα πράγματʼ εἰδέναι σαφῶς ἅττʼ ἐστὶν ὀρθῶς; νὴ Δίʼ εἴπερ ἔστι γε. καὶ ξυγγενέσθαι ταῖς Νεφέλαισιν ἐς λόγους, ταῖς ἡμετέραισι δαίμοσιν; μάλιστά γε. κάθιζε τοίνυν ἐπὶ τὸν ἱερὸν σκίμποδα. ἰδοὺ κάθημαι. τουτονὶ τοίνυν λαβὲ τὸν στέφανον. ἐπὶ τί στέφανον; οἴμοι Σώκρατες ὥσπερ με τὸν Ἀθάμανθʼ ὅπως μὴ θύσετε. οὔκ, ἀλλὰ ταῦτα πάντα τοὺς τελουμένους ἡμεῖς ποιοῦμεν. εἶτα δὴ τί κερδανῶ; λέγειν γενήσει τρῖμμα κρόταλον παιπάλη. ἀλλʼ ἔχʼ ἀτρεμί.
By Jupiter! You will not deceive me; for if I am besprinkled, I shall become fine flour. It becomes the old man to speak words of good omen, and to hearken to my prayer. O sovereign King, immeasurable Air, who keepest the earth suspended, and through bright Aether, and ye august goddesses, the Clouds, sending thunder and lightning, arise, appear in the air, O mistresses, to your deep thinker! Not yet, not yet, till I wrap this around me lest I be wet through. To think of my having come from home without even a cap, unlucky man! Come then, ye highly honoured Clouds, for a display to this man. Whether ye are sitting upon the sacred snow-covered summits of Olympus , or in the gardens of Father Ocean form a sacred dance with the Nymphs, or draw in golden pitchers the streams of the waters of the Nile , or inhabit the Maeotic lake, or the snowy rock of Mimas, hearken to our prayer, and receive the sacrifice, and be propitious to the sacred rites.	μὰ τὸν Δίʼ οὐ ψεύσει γέ με· καταπαττόμενος γὰρ παιπάλη γενήσομαι. εὐφημεῖν χρὴ τὸν πρεσβύτην καὶ τῆς εὐχῆς ἐπακούειν. ὦ δέσποτʼ ἄναξ ἀμέτρητʼ Ἀήρ, ὃς ἔχεις τὴν γῆν μετέωρον, λαμπρός τʼ Αἰθὴρ σεμναί τε θεαὶ Νεφέλαι βροντησικέραυνοι, ἄρθητε φάνητʼ ὦ δέσποιναι τῷ φροντιστῇ μετέωροι. μήπω μήπω γε πρὶν ἂν τουτὶ πτύξωμαι, μὴ καταβρεχθῶ. τὸ δὲ μηδὲ κυνῆν οἴκοθεν ἐλθεῖν ἐμὲ τὸν κακοδαίμονʼ ἔχοντα. ἔλθετε δῆτʼ ὦ πολυτίμητοι Νεφέλαι τῷδʼ εἰς ἐπίδειξιν· εἴτʼ ἐπʼ Ὀλύμπου κορυφαῖς ἱεραῖς χιονοβλήτοισι κάθησθε, εἴτʼ Ὠκεανοῦ πατρὸς ἐν κήποις ἱερὸν χορὸν ἵστατε Νύμφαις, εἴτʼ ἄρα Νείλου προχοαῖς ὑδάτων χρυσέαις ἀρύτεσθε πρόχοισιν, ἢ Μαιῶτιν λίμνην ἔχετʼ ἢ σκόπελον νιφόεντα Μίμαντος· ὑπακούσατε δεξάμεναι θυσίαν καὶ τοῖς ἱεροῖσι χαρεῖσαι.
Eternal Clouds! Let us arise to view with our dewy, clear-bright nature, from loud-sounding Father Ocean to the wood-crowned summits of the lofty mountains, in order that we may behold clearly the far-seen watch-towers, and the fruits, and the fostering, sacred earth, and the rushing sounds of the divine rivers, and the roaring, loud-sounding sea; for the unwearied eye of Aether sparkles with glittering rays. Come, let us shake off the watery cloud from our immortal forms and survey the earth with far-seeing eye.	ἀέναοι Νεφέλαι ἀρθῶμεν φανεραὶ δροσερὰν φύσιν εὐάγητον, πατρὸς ἀπʼ Ὠκεανοῦ βαρυαχέος ὑψηλῶν ὀρέων κορυφὰς ἐπὶ δενδροκόμους, ἵνα τηλεφανεῖς σκοπιὰς ἀφορώμεθα, καρπούς τʼ ἀρδομέναν ἱερὰν χθόνα, καὶ ποταμῶν ζαθέων κελαδήματα, καὶ πόντον κελάδοντα βαρύβρομον· ὄμμα γὰρ αἰθέρος ἀκάματον σελαγεῖται μαρμαρέαις ἐν αὐγαῖς. ἀλλʼ ἀποσεισάμεναι νέφος ὄμβριον ἀθανάτας ἰδέας ἐπιδώμεθα τηλεσκόπῳ ὄμματι γαῖαν.
O ye greatly venerable Clouds, ye have clearly heard me when I called. Did you hear the voice, and the thunder which bellowed at the same time, feared as a god? I too worship you, O ye highly honoured, and am inclined to reply to the thundering, so much do I tremble at them and am alarmed. And whether it be lawful, or be not lawful, I have a desire just now to ease myself. Don't scoff, nor do what these poor-devil-poets do, but use words of good omen, for a great swarm of goddesses is in motion with their songs. Ye rain-bringing virgins, let us come to the fruitful land of Pallas, to view the much-loved country of Cecrops, abounding in brave men; where is reverence for sacred rites not to be divulged; where the house that receives the initiated is thrown open in holy mystic rites; and gifts to the celestial gods; and high-roofed temples, and statues; and most sacred processions in honour of the blessed gods; and well-crowned sacrifices to the gods, and feasts, at all seasons; and with the approach of spring the Bacchic festivity, and the rousings of melodious choruses, and the loud-sounding music of flutes.	ὦ μέγα σεμναὶ Νεφέλαι φανερῶς ἠκούσατέ μου καλέσαντος. ᾔσθου φωνῆς ἅμα καὶ βροντῆς μυκησαμένης θεοσέπτου; καὶ σέβομαί γʼ ὦ πολυτίμητοι καὶ βούλομαι ἀνταποπαρδεῖν πρὸς τὰς βροντάς· οὕτως αὐτὰς τετρεμαίνω καὶ πεφόβημαι· κεἰ θέμις ἐστίν, νυνί γʼ ἤδη, κεἰ μὴ θέμις ἐστί, χεσείω. οὐ μὴ σκώψει μηδὲ ποιήσεις ἅπερ οἱ τρυγοδαίμονες οὗτοι, ἀλλʼ εὐφήμει· μέγα γάρ τι θεῶν κινεῖται σμῆνος ἀοιδαῖς. παρθένοι ὀμβροφόροι ἔλθωμεν λιπαρὰν χθόνα Παλλάδος, εὔανδρον γᾶν Κέκροπος ὀψόμεναι πολυήρατον· οὗ σέβας ἀρρήτων ἱερῶν, ἵνα μυστοδόκος δόμος ἐν τελεταῖς ἁγίαις ἀναδείκνυται, οὐρανίοις τε θεοῖς δωρήματα, ναοί θʼ ὑψερεφεῖς καὶ ἀγάλματα, καὶ πρόσοδοι μακάρων ἱερώταται, εὐστέφανοί τε θεῶν θυσίαι θαλίαι τε, παντοδαπαῖς ἐν ὥραις, ἦρί τʼ ἐπερχομένῳ Βρομία χάρις, εὐκελάδων τε χορῶν ἐρεθίσματα, καὶ μοῦσα βαρύβρομος αὐλῶν.
Tell me, O Socrates, I beseech you, by Jupiter, who are these that have uttered this grand song? Are they some heroines? By no means; but heavenly Clouds, great divinities to idle men; who supply us with thought and argument, and intelligence and humbug, and circumlocution, and ability to hoax, and comprehension. On this account therefore my soul, having heard their voice, flutters, and already seeks to discourse subtilely, and to quibble about smoke, and having pricked a maxim with a little notion, to refute the opposite argument. So that now I eagerly desire, if by any means it be possible, to see them palpably. Look, then, hither, toward Mount Parnes; for now I behold them descending gently. Pray where? Show me. See! There they come in great numbers through the hollows and thickets; there, obliquely. What's the matter? For I can't see them. By the entrance. Now at length with difficulty I just see them. Now at length you assuredly see them, unless you have your eyes running pumpkins. Yes, by Jupiter! O highly honoured Clouds, for now they cover all things. Did you not, however, know, nor yet consider, these to be goddesses? No, by Jupiter! But I thought them to be mist, and dew, and smoke. For you do not know, by Jupiter! that these feed very many sophists, Thurian soothsayers, practisers of medicine, lazy-long-haired-onyx-ring-wearers, song-twisters for the cyclic dances, and meteorological quacks. They feed idle people who do nothing, because such men celebrate them in verse. For this reason, then, they introduced into their verses the dreadful impetuosity of the moist, whirling-bright clouds ; and the curls of hundred-headed Typho ; and the hard-blowing tempests ; and then aerial, moist ; crooked-clawed birds, floating in air and the showers of rain from dewy Clouds. And then, in return for these, they swallow slices of great, fine mullets, and bird's-flesh of thrushes. Is it not just, however, that they should have their reward, on account of these? Tell me, pray, if they are really clouds, what ails them, that they resemble mortal women? For they are not such. Pray, of what nature are they? I do not clearly know: at any rate they resemble spread-out fleeces, and not women, by Jupiter! Not a bit; for these have noses. Answer, then, whatever I ask you. Then say quickly what you wish. Have you ever, when you; looked up, seen a cloud like to a centaur, or a panther, or a wolf, or a bull? By Jupiter, have I! But what of that? They become all things, whatever they please. And then if they see a person with long hair, a wild one of these hairy fellows, like the son of Xenophantes, in derision of his folly, they liken themselves to centaurs. Why, what, if they should see Simon, a plunderer of the public property, what do they do? They suddenly become wolves, showing up his disposition. For this reason, then, for this reason, when they yesterday saw Cleonymus the recreant, on this account they became stags, because they saw this most cowardly fellow. And now too, because they saw Clisthenes, you observe, on this account they became women.	πρὸς τοῦ Διὸς ἀντιβολῶ σε φράσον, τίνες εἴσʼ ὦ Σώκρατες αὗται αἱ φθεγξάμεναι τοῦτο τὸ σεμνόν; μῶν ἡρῷναί τινές εἰσιν; ἥκιστʼ ἀλλʼ οὐράνιαι Νεφέλαι μεγάλαι θεαὶ ἀνδράσιν ἀργοῖς· αἵπερ γνώμην καὶ διάλεξιν καὶ νοῦν ἡμῖν παρέχουσιν καὶ τερατείαν καὶ περίλεξιν καὶ κροῦσιν καὶ κατάληψιν. ταῦτʼ ἄρʼ ἀκούσασʼ αὐτῶν τὸ φθέγμʼ ἡ ψυχή μου πεπότηται, καὶ λεπτολογεῖν ἤδη ζητεῖ καὶ περὶ καπνοῦ στενολεσχεῖν, καὶ γνωμιδίῳ γνώμην νύξασʼ ἑτέρῳ λόγῳ ἀντιλογῆσαι· ὥστʼ εἴ πως ἔστιν ἰδεῖν αὐτὰς ἤδη φανερῶς ἐπιθυμῶ. βλέπε νυν δευρὶ πρὸς τὴν Πάρνηθʼ· ἤδη γὰρ ὁρῶ κατιούσας ἡσυχῇ αὐτάς. φέρε ποῦ; δεῖξον. χωροῦσʼ αὗται πάνυ πολλαὶ διὰ τῶν κοίλων καὶ τῶν δασέων, αὗται πλάγιαι. τί τὸ χρῆμα; ὡς οὐ καθορῶ. παρὰ τὴν εἴσοδον. ἤδη νυνὶ μόλις οὕτως. νῦν γέ τοι ἤδη καθορᾷς αὐτάς, εἰ μὴ λημᾷς κολοκύνταις. νὴ Δίʼ ἔγωγʼ, ὦ πολυτίμητοι· πάντα γὰρ ἤδη κατέχουσιν. ταύτας μέντοι σὺ θεὰς οὔσας οὐκ ᾔδησθʼ οὐδʼ ἐνόμιζες; μὰ Δίʼ ἀλλʼ ὁμίχλην καὶ δρόσον αὐτὰς ἡγούμην καὶ καπνὸν εἶναι. οὐ γὰρ μὰ Δίʼ οἶσθʼ ὁτιὴ πλείστους αὗται βόσκουσι σοφιστάς, Θουριομάντεις ἰατροτέχνας σφραγιδονυχαργοκομήτας, κυκλίων τε χορῶν ᾀσματοκάμπτας ἄνδρας μετεωροφένακας, οὐδὲν δρῶντας βόσκουσʼ ἀργούς, ὅτι ταύτας μουσοποιοῦσιν. ταῦτʼ ἄρʼ ἐποίουν ὑγρᾶν Νεφελᾶν στρεπταιγλᾶν δάιον ὁρμάν, πλοκάμους θʼ ἑκατογκεφάλα Τυφῶ πρημαινούσας τε θυέλλας, εἶτʼ ἀερίας διεράς, γαμψοὺς οἰωνοὺς ἀερονηχεῖς, ὄμβρους θʼ ὑδάτων δροσερᾶν Νεφελᾶν· εἶτʼ ἀντʼ αὐτῶν κατέπινον κεστρᾶν τεμάχη μεγαλᾶν ἀγαθᾶν κρέα τʼ ὀρνίθεια κιχηλᾶν. διὰ μέντοι τάσδʼ οὐχὶ δικαίως; λέξον δή μοι, τί παθοῦσαι, εἴπερ νεφέλαι γʼ εἰσὶν ἀληθῶς, θνηταῖς εἴξασι γυναιξίν; οὐ γὰρ ἐκεῖναί γʼ εἰσὶ τοιαῦται. φέρε ποῖαι γάρ τινές εἰσιν; οὐκ οἶδα σαφῶς· εἴξασιν γοῦν ἐρίοισιν πεπταμένοισιν, κοὐχὶ γυναιξὶν μὰ Δίʼ οὐδʼ ὁτιοῦν· αὗται δὲ ῥῖνας ἔχουσιν. ἀπόκριναί νυν ἅττʼ ἂν ἔρωμαι. λέγε νυν ταχέως ὅ τι βούλει. ἤδη ποτʼ ἀναβλέψας εἶδες νεφέλην κενταύρῳ ὁμοίαν, ἢ παρδάλει ἢ λύκῳ ἢ ταύρῳ; νὴ Δίʼ ἔγωγʼ. εἶτα τί τοῦτο; γίγνονται πάνθʼ ὅ τι βούλονται· κᾆτʼ ἢν μὲν ἴδωσι κομήτην ἄγριόν τινα τῶν λασίων τούτων, οἷόνπερ τὸν Ξενοφάντου, σκώπτουσαι τὴν μανίαν αὐτοῦ κενταύροις ᾔκασαν αὑτάς. τί γὰρ ἢν ἅρπαγα τῶν δημοσίων κατίδωσι Σίμωνα, τί δρῶσιν; ἀποφαίνουσαι τὴν φύσιν αὐτοῦ λύκοι ἐξαίφνης ἐγένοντο. ταῦτʼ ἄρα ταῦτα Κλεώνυμον αὗται τὸν ῥίψασπιν χθὲς ἰδοῦσαι, ὅτι δειλότατον τοῦτον ἑώρων, ἔλαφοι διὰ τοῦτʼ ἐγένοντο. καὶ νῦν γʼ ὅτι Κλεισθένη εἶδον, ὁρᾷς, διὰ τοῦτʼ ἐγένοντο γυναῖκες.
Hail therefore, O mistresses! And now, if ever ye did to any other, to me also utter a voice reaching to heaven, O all-powerful queens. Hail, O ancient veteran, hunter after learned speeches! And thou, O priest of most subtle trifles! Tell us what you require? For we would not hearken to any other of the recent meteorological sophists, except to Prodicus; to him, on account of his wisdom and intelligence; and to you, because you walk proudly in the streets, and cast your eyes askance, and endure many hardships with bare feet, and in reliance upon us lookest supercilious. O Earth, what a voice! How holy and dignified and wondrous! For, in fact, these alone are goddesses; and all the rest is nonsense. But come, by the Earth, is not Jupiter, the Olympian, a god? What Jupiter? Do not trifle. There is no Jupiter. What do you say? Who rains then? For first of all explain this to me. These to be sure. I will teach you it by powerful evidence. Come, where have you ever seen him raining at any time without Clouds? And yet he ought to rain in fine weather, and these be absent. By Apollo, of a truth you have rightly confirmed this by your present argument. And yet, before this, I really thought that Jupiter caused the rain. But tell me who is it that thunders. This makes me tremble. These, as they roll, thunder. In what way? you all-daring man! When they are full of much water, and are compelled to be borne along, being necessarily precipitated when full of rain, then they fall heavily upon each other and burst and clap. Who is it that compels them to borne along? Is it not Jupiter? By no means, but aethereal Vortex. Vortex? It had escaped my notice that Jupiter did not exist, and that Vortex now reigned in his stead. But you have taught me nothing as yet concerning the clap and the thunder. Have you not heard me, that I said that the Clouds, when full of moisture, dash against each other and clap by reason of their density? Come, how am I to believe this? I'll teach you from your own case. Were you ever, after being stuffed with broth at the Panathenaic festival, then disturbed in your belly, and did a tumult suddenly rumble through it? Yes, by Apollo! And immediately the little broth plays the mischief with me, and is disturbed and rumbles like thunder, and grumbles dreadfully: at first gently pappax, pappax; and then it adds papa-pappax; and finally, it thunders downright papapappax, as they do.	χαίρετε τοίνυν ὦ δέσποιναι· καὶ νῦν, εἴπερ τινὶ κἄλλῳ, οὐρανομήκη ῥήξατε κἀμοὶ φωνήν, ὦ παμβασίλειαι. χαῖρʼ ὦ πρεσβῦτα παλαιογενὲς θηρατὰ λόγων φιλομούσων, σύ τε λεπτοτάτων λήρων ἱερεῦ, φράζε πρὸς ἡμᾶς ὅ τι χρῄζεις· οὐ γὰρ ἂν ἄλλῳ γʼ ὑπακούσαιμεν τῶν νῦν μετεωροσοφιστῶν πλὴν ἢ Προδίκῳ, τῷ μὲν σοφίας καὶ γνώμης οὕνεκα, σοὶ δέ, ὅτι βρενθύει τʼ ἐν ταῖσιν ὁδοῖς καὶ τὠφθαλμὼ παραβάλλεις, κἀνυπόδητος κακὰ πόλλʼ ἀνέχει κἀφʼ ἡμῖν σεμνοπροσωπεῖς. ὦ γῆ τοῦ φθέγματος, ὡς ἱερὸν καὶ σεμνὸν καὶ τερατῶδες. αὗται γάρ τοι μόναι εἰσὶ θεαί, τἄλλα δὲ πάντʼ ἐστὶ φλύαρος. ὁ Ζεὺς δʼ ἡμῖν, φέρε πρὸς τῆς γῆς, οὑλύμπιος οὐ θεός ἐστιν; ποῖος Ζεύς; οὐ μὴ ληρήσεις· οὐδʼ ἔστι Ζεύς. τί λέγεις σύ; ἀλλὰ τίς ὕει; τουτὶ γὰρ ἔμοιγʼ ἀπόφηναι πρῶτον ἁπάντων. αὗται δήπου· μεγάλοις δέ σʼ ἐγὼ σημείοις αὐτὸ διδάξω. φέρε ποῦ γὰρ πώποτʼ ἄνευ Νεφελῶν ὕοντʼ ἤδη τεθέασαι; καίτοι χρῆν αἰθρίας ὕειν αὐτόν, ταύτας δʼ ἀποδημεῖν. νὴ τὸν Ἀπόλλω τοῦτό γέ τοι δὴ τῷ νῦν λόγῳ εὖ προσέφυσας· καίτοι πρότερον τὸν Δίʼ ἀληθῶς ᾤμην διὰ κοσκίνου οὐρεῖν. ἀλλʼ ὅστις ὁ βροντῶν ἐστι φράσον· τοῦτό με ποιεῖ τετρεμαίνειν. αὗται βροντῶσι κυλινδόμεναι. τῷ τρόπῳ ὦ πάντα σὺ τολμῶν; ὅταν ἐμπλησθῶσʼ ὕδατος πολλοῦ κἀναγκασθῶσι φέρεσθαι, κατακρημνάμεναι πλήρεις ὄμβρου διʼ ἀνάγκην, εἶτα βαρεῖαι εἰς ἀλλήλας ἐμπίπτουσαι ῥήγνυνται καὶ παταγοῦσιν. ὁ δʼ ἀναγκάζων ἐστὶ τίς αὐτάς, οὐχ ὁ Ζεύς, ὥστε φέρεσθαι; ἥκιστʼ ἀλλʼ αἰθέριος Δῖνος.

Consider, therefore, how you have trumpeted from a little belly so small; and how is it not probable that this air, being boundless, should thunder so loudly? For this reason, therefore, the two names also Trump and Thunder, are similar to each other. But teach me this, whence comes the thunderbolt blazing with fire, and burns us to ashes when it smites us, and singes those who survive. For indeed Jupiter evidently hurls this at the perjured. Why, how then, you foolish person, and savouring of the dark ages and antediluvian, if his manner is to smite the perjured, does he not blast Simon, and Cleonymus, and Theorus? And yet they are very perjured. But he smites his own temple, and Sunium the promontory of Athens , and the tall oaks. Wherefore, for indeed an oak does not commit perjury. I do not know; but you seem to speak well. For what, pray, is the thunderbolt? When a dry wind, having been raised aloft, is inclosed in these Clouds, it inflates them within, like a bladder; and then, of necessity, having burst them, it rushes out with vehemence by reason of its density, setting fire to itself through its rushing and impetuosity. By Jupiter, of a truth I once experienced this exactly at the Diasian festival! I was roasting a haggis for my kinsfolk, and through neglect I did not cut it open; but it became inflated and then suddenly bursting, befouled my eyes and burned my face. O mortal, who hast desired great wisdom from us! How happy will you become among the Athenians and among the Greeks, if you be possessed of a good memory, and be a deep thinker, and endurance of labour be implanted in your soul, and you be not wearied either by standing or walking, nor be exceedingly vexed at shivering with cold, nor long to break your fast, and you refrain from wine, and gymnastics, and the other follies, and consider this the highest excellence, as is proper a clever man should, to conquer by action and counsel, and by battling with your tongue. As far as regards a sturdy spirit, and care that makes one's bed uneasy, and a frugal spirit and hard-living and savory-eating belly, be of good courage and don't trouble yourself; I would offer myself to hammer on, for that matter. Will you not, pray, now believe in no god, except what we believe in--this Chaos, and the Clouds, and the Tongue--these three? Absolutely I would not even converse with the others, not even if I met them; nor would I sacrifice to them, nor make libations, nor offer frankincense. Tell us then boldly, what we must do for you? For you shall not fail in getting it, if you honour and admire us, and seek to become clever. O mistresses, I request of you then this very small favour, that I be the best of the Greeks in speaking by a hundred stadia. Well, you shall have this from us, so that hence-forward from this time no one shall get more opinions passed in the public assemblies than you. Grant me not to deliver important opinions; for I do not desire these, but only to pervert the right for my own advantage, and to evade my creditors. Then you shall obtain what you desire; for you do not covet great things. But commit yourself without fear to our ministers.	σκέψαι τοίνυν ἀπὸ γαστριδίου τυννουτουὶ οἷα πέπορδας· τὸν δʼ Ἀέρα τόνδʼ ὄντʼ ἀπέραντον πῶς οὐκ εἰκὸς μέγα βροντᾶν; ταῦτʼ ἄρα καὶ τὠνόματʼ ἀλλήλοιν βροντὴ καὶ πορδὴ ὁμοίω. ἀλλʼ ὁ κεραυνὸς πόθεν αὖ φέρεται λάμπων πυρί, τοῦτο δίδαξον, καὶ καταφρύγει βάλλων ἡμᾶς, τοὺς δὲ ζῶντας περιφλύει; τοῦτον γὰρ δὴ φανερῶς ὁ Ζεὺς ἵησʼ ἐπὶ τοὺς ἐπιόρκους. καὶ πῶς ὦ μῶρε σὺ καὶ Κρονίων ὄζων καὶ βεκκεσέληνε, εἴπερ βάλλει τοὺς ἐπιόρκους, δῆτʼ οὐχὶ Σίμωνʼ ἐνέπρησεν οὐδὲ Κλεώνυμον οὐδὲ Θέωρον; καίτοι σφόδρα γʼ εἴσʼ ἐπίορκοι· ἀλλὰ τὸν αὑτοῦ γε νεὼν βάλλει καὶ Σούνιον ἄκρον Ἀθηνέων καὶ τὰς δρῦς τὰς μεγάλας· τί μαθών; οὐ γὰρ δὴ δρῦς γʼ ἐπιορκεῖ. οὐκ οἶδʼ· ἀτὰρ εὖ σὺ λέγειν φαίνει. τί γάρ ἐστιν δῆθʼ ὁ κεραυνός; ὅταν ἐς ταύτας ἄνεμος ξηρὸς μετεωρισθεὶς κατακλῃσθῇ, ἔνδοθεν αὐτὰς ὥσπερ κύστιν φυσᾷ, κἄπειθʼ ὑπʼ ἀνάγκης ῥήξας αὐτὰς ἔξω φέρεται σοβαρὸς διὰ τὴν πυκνότητα, ὑπὸ τοῦ ῥοίβδου καὶ τῆς ῥύμης αὐτὸς ἑαυτὸν κατακάων. νὴ Δίʼ ἐγὼ γοῦν ἀτεχνῶς ἔπαθον τουτί ποτε Διασίοισιν ὀπτῶν γαστέρα τοῖς συγγενέσιν, κᾆτʼ οὐκ ἔσχων ἀμελήσας· ἡ δʼ ἄρʼ ἐφυσᾶτʼ, εἶτʼ ἐξαίφνης διαλακήσασα πρὸς αὐτὼ τὠφθαλμώ μου προσετίλησεν καὶ κατέκαυσεν τὸ πρόσωπον. ὦ τῆς μεγάλης ἐπιθυμήσας σοφίας ἄνθρωπε παρʼ ἡμῶν, ὡς εὐδαίμων ἐν Ἀθηναίοις καὶ τοῖς Ἕλλησι γενήσει, εἰ μνήμων εἶ καὶ φροντιστὴς καὶ τὸ ταλαίπωρον ἔνεστιν ἐν τῇ ψυχῇ, καὶ μὴ κάμνεις μήθʼ ἑστὼς μήτε βαδίζων, μήτε ῥιγῶν ἄχθει λίαν μήτʼ ἀριστᾶν ἐπιθυμεῖς, οἴνου τʼ ἀπέχει καὶ γυμνασίων καὶ τῶν ἄλλων ἀνοήτων, καὶ βέλτιστον τοῦτο νομίζεις, ὅπερ εἰκὸς δεξιὸν ἄνδρα, νικᾶν πράττων καὶ βουλεύων καὶ τῇ γλώττῃ πολεμίζων. ἀλλʼ οὕνεκά γε ψυχῆς στερρᾶς δυσκολοκοίτου τε μερίμνης καὶ φειδωλοῦ καὶ τρυσιβίου γαστρὸς καὶ θυμβρεπιδείπνου, ἀμέλει θαρρῶν οὕνεκα τούτων ἐπιχαλκεύειν παρέχοιμʼ ἄν. ἄλλο τι δῆτʼ οὖν νομιεῖς ἤδη θεὸν οὐδένα πλὴν ἅπερ ἡμεῖς, τὸ Χάος τουτὶ καὶ τὰς Νεφέλας καὶ τὴν γλῶτταν, τρία ταυτί; οὐδʼ ἂν διαλεχθείην γʼ ἀτεχνῶς τοῖς ἄλλοις οὐδʼ ἂν ἀπαντῶν· οὐδʼ ἂν θύσαιμʼ, οὐδʼ ἂν σπείσαιμʼ, οὐδʼ ἐπιθείην λιβανωτόν. λέγε νυν ἡμῖν ὅ τι σοι δρῶμεν θαρρῶν, ὡς οὐκ ἀτυχήσεις ἡμᾶς τιμῶν καὶ θαυμάζων καὶ ζητῶν δεξιὸς εἶναι. ὦ δέσποιναι δέομαι τοίνυν ὑμῶν τουτὶ πάνυ μικρόν, τῶν Ἑλλήνων εἶναί με λέγειν ἑκατὸν σταδίοισιν ἄριστον. ἀλλʼ ἔσται σοι τοῦτο παρʼ ἡμῶν· ὥστε τὸ λοιπόν γʼ ἀπὸ τουδὶ ἐν τῷ δήμῳ γνώμας οὐδεὶς νικήσει πλείονας ἢ σύ. μὴ ʼμοί γε λέγειν γνώμας μεγάλας· οὐ γὰρ τούτων ἐπιθυμῶ, ἀλλʼ ὅσʼ ἐμαυτῷ στρεψοδικῆσαι καὶ τοὺς χρήστας διολισθεῖν. τεύξει τοίνυν ὧν ἱμείρεις· οὐ γὰρ μεγάλων ἐπιθυμεῖς. ἀλλὰ σεαυτὸν θαρρῶν παράδος τοῖς ἡμετέροις προπόλοισιν.
I will do so in reliance upon you, for necessity oppresses me, on account of the blood-horses, and the marriage that ruined me. Now, therefore, let them use me as they please. I give up this body to them to be beaten, to be hungered, to be troubled with thirst, to be squalid, to shiver with cold, to flay into a leathern bottle, if I shall escape clear from my debts, and appear to men to be bold, glib of tongue, audacious, impudent, shameless, a fabricator of falsehoods, inventive of words, a practiced knave in lawsuits, a law-tablet, a thorough rattle, a fox, a sharper, a slippery knave, a dissembler, a slippery fellow, an impostor, a gallows-bird, a blackguard, a twister, a troublesome fellow, a licker-up of hashes. If they call me this, when they meet me, let them do to me absolutely what they please. And if they like, by Ceres, let them serve up a sausage out of me to the deep thinkers.	δράσω ταῦθʼ ὑμῖν πιστεύσας· ἡ γὰρ ἀνάγκη με πιέζει διὰ τοὺς ἵππους τοὺς κοππατίας καὶ τὸν γάμον ὅς μʼ ἐπέτριψεν. νῦν οὖν ἀτεχνῶς ὅ τι βούλονται τουτὶ τοὐμὸν σῶμʼ αὐτοῖσιν παρέχω, τύπτειν πεινῆν διψῆν αὐχμεῖν ῥιγῶν ἀσκὸν δείρειν, εἴπερ τὰ χρέα διαφευξοῦμαι, τοῖς τʼ ἀνθρώποις εἶναι δόξω θρασὺς εὔγλωττος τολμηρὸς ἴτης βδελυρὸς ψευδῶν συγκολλητὴς εὑρησιεπὴς περίτριμμα δικῶν κύρβις κρόταλον κίναδος τρύμη μάσθλης εἴρων γλοιὸς ἀλαζὼν κέντρων μιαρὸς στρόφις ἀργαλέος ματιολοιχός· ταῦτʼ εἴ με καλοῦσʼ ἁπαντῶντες, δρώντων ἀτεχνῶς ὅ τι χρῄζουσιν, κεἰ βούλονται νὴ τὴν Δήμητρʼ ἔκ μου χορδὴν τοῖς φροντισταῖς παραθέντων.
This man has a spirit not void of courage, but prompt. Know, that if you learn these matters from me, you will possess among mortals a glory as high as heaven. What shall I experience? You shall pass with me the most enviable of mortal lives the whole time. Shall I then ever see this? Yea, so that many be always seated at your gates, wishing to communicate with you and come to a conference with you, to consult with you as to actions and affidavits of many talents, as is worthy of your abilities.	λῆμα μὲν πάρεστι τῷδέ γʼ οὐκ ἄτολμον ἀλλʼ ἕτοιμον. ἴσθι δʼ ὡς ταῦτα μαθὼν παρʼ ἐμοῦ κλέος οὐρανόμηκες ἐν βροτοῖσιν ἕξεις. τί πείσομαι; τὸν πάντα χρόνον μετʼ ἐμοῦ ζηλωτότατον βίον ἀνθρώπων διάξεις. ἆρά γε τοῦτʼ ἄρʼ ἐγώ ποτʼ ὄψομαι; ὥστε γέ σου πολλοὺς ἐπὶ ταῖσι θύραις ἀεὶ καθῆσθαι, βουλομένους ἀνακοινοῦσθαί τε καὶ ἐς λόγον ἐλθεῖν πράγματα κἀντιγραφὰς πολλῶν ταλάντων, ἄξια σῇ φρενὶ συμβουλευσομένους μετὰ σοῦ.
But attempt to teach the old man by degrees whatever you purpose, and scrutinize his intellect, and make trial of his mind.	ἀλλʼ ἐγχείρει τὸν πρεσβύτην ὅ τι περ μέλλεις προδιδάσκειν, καὶ διακίνει τὸν νοῦν αὐτοῦ καὶ τῆς γνώμης ἀποπειρῶ.
Come now, tell me your own turn of mind; in order that, when I know of what sort it is, I may now, after this, apply to you new engines. What? By the gods, do you purpose to besiege me? No; I wish to briefly learn from you if you are possessed of a good memory. In two ways, by Jove! If anything be owing to me, I have a very good memory; but if I owe unhappy man, I am very forgetful. Is the power of speaking, pray, implanted in your nature? Speaking is not in me, but cheating is. How, then, will you be able to learn? Excellently, of course. Come, then, take care that, whenever I propound any clever dogma about abstruse matters, you catch it up immediately. What then? Am I to feed upon wisdom like a dog? This man is ignorant and brutish--I fear, old man, lest you will need blows. Come, let me see; what do you do if any one beat you? I take the beating; and then, when I have waited a little while, I call witnesses to prove it; then again, after a short interval, I go to law. Come, then, lay down your cloak. Have I done any wrong? No; but it is the rule to enter naked. But I do not enter to search for stolen goods. Lay it down. Why do you talk nonsense? Now tell me this, pray. If I be diligent and learn zealously, to which of your disciples shall I become like? You will no way differ from Chaerephon in intellect. Ah me, unhappy! I shall become half-dead. Don't chatter; but quickly follow me hither with smartness. Then give me first into my hands a honeyed cake; for I am afraid of descending within, as if into the cave of Trophonius. Proceed; why do you keep poking about the door?	ἄγε δὴ κάτειπέ μοι σὺ τὸν σαυτοῦ τρόπον, ἵνʼ αὐτὸν εἰδὼς ὅστις ἐστὶ μηχανὰς ἤδη ʼπὶ τούτοις πρὸς σὲ καινὰς προσφέρω. τί δέ; τειχομαχεῖν μοι διανοεῖ πρὸς τῶν θεῶν; οὔκ, ἀλλὰ βραχέα σου πυθέσθαι βούλομαι. ἦ μνημονικὸς εἶ; δύο τρόπω νὴ τὸν Δία· ἢν μὲν γὰρ ὀφείληταί τί μοι, μνήμων πάνυ· ἐὰν δʼ ὀφείλω, σχέτλιος, ἐπιλήσμων πάνυ. ἔνεστι δῆτα μανθάνειν ἐν τῇ φύσει; λέγειν μὲν οὐκ ἔνεστʼ, ἀποστερεῖν δʼ ἔνι. πῶς οὖν δυνήσει μανθάνειν; ἀμέλει καλῶς. ἄγε νυν ὅπως, ὅταν τι προβάλλω σοι σοφὸν περὶ τῶν μετεώρων, εὐθέως ὑφαρπάσει. τί δαί; κυνηδὸν τὴν σοφίαν σιτήσομαι; ἄνθρωπος ἀμαθὴς οὑτοσὶ καὶ βάρβαρος. δέδοικά σʼ ὦ πρεσβῦτα μὴ πληγῶν δέει. φέρʼ ἴδω τί δρᾷς, ἤν τίς σε τύπτῃ; τύπτομαι, ἔπειτʼ ἐπισχὼν ὀλίγον ἐπιμαρτύρομαι, εἶτʼ αὖθις ἀκαρῆ διαλιπὼν δικάζομαι. ἴθι νυν κατάθου θοἰμάτιον. ἠδίκηκά τι, οὔκ, ἀλλὰ γυμνοὺς εἰσιέναι νομίζεται. ἀλλʼ οὐχὶ φωράσων ἔγωγʼ εἰσέρχομαι. κατάθου. τί ληρεῖς; εἰπὲ δή νύν μοι· τὸ τί; ἢν ἐπιμελὴς ὦ καὶ προθύμως μανθάνω, τῷ τῶν μαθητῶν ἐμφερὴς γενήσομαι; οὐδὲν διοίσεις Χαιρεφῶντος τὴν φύσιν. οἴμοι κακοδαίμων ἡμιθνὴς γενήσομαι. οὐ μὴ λαλήσεις, ἀλλʼ ἀκολουθήσεις ἐμοὶ ἀνύσας τι δευρὶ θᾶττον; ἐς τὼ χεῖρέ νυν δός μοι μελιτοῦτταν πρότερον· ὡς δέδοικʼ ἐγὼ εἴσω καταβαίνων ὥσπερ ἐς Τροφωνίου. χώρει· τί κυπτάζεις ἔχων περὶ τὴν θύραν;
Well, go in peace, for the sake of this your valour. May prosperity attend the man, because, being advanced into the vale of years, he imbues his intellect with modern subjects, and cultivates wisdom!	ἀλλʼ ἴθι χαίρων τῆς ἀνδρείας οὕνεκα ταύτης. εὐτυχία γένοιτο τἀνθρώπῳ, ὅτι προήκων ἐς βαθὺ τῆς ἡλικίας νεωτέροις τὴν φύσιν αὑτοῦ πράγμασιν χρωτίζεται καὶ σοφίαν ἐπασκεῖ.
Spectators, I will freely declare to you the truth, by Bacchus, who nurtured me! So may I conquer, and be accounted skillful, as that, deeming you to be clever spectators, and this to be the cleverest of my comedies, I thought proper to let you first taste that comedy, which gave me the greatest labour. And then I retired from the contest defeated by vulgar fellows, though I did not deserve it. These things, therefore, I object to you, a learned audience, for whose sake I was expending this labour. But not even thus will I ever willingly desert the discerning portion of you. For since what time my Modest Man and my Rake were very highly praised here by an audience, with whom it is a pleasure even to hold converse, and I (for I was still a virgin, and it was not lawful for me as yet to have children) exposed my offspring, and another girl took it up, and owned it, and you generously reared and educated it, from this time I have had sure pledges of your good will toward me. Now, therefore, like that well-known Electra, has this comedy come seeking, if haply it meet with an audience so clever, for it will recognize, if it should see, the lock of its brother. But see how modest she is by nature, who, in the first place, has come, having stitched to her no leathern phallus hanging down, red at the top, and thick, to set the boys a laughing; nor yet jeered the bald-headed, nor danced the cordax; nor does the old man who speaks the verses beat the person near him with his staff, keeping out of sight wretched ribaldry; nor has she rushed in with torches, nor does she shout iou, iou; but has come relying on herself and her verses. And I, although so excellent a poet, do not give myself airs, nor do I seek to deceive you by twice and thrice bringing forward the same pieces; but I am always clever at introducing new fashions, not at all resembling each other, and all of them clever; who struck Cleon in the belly when at the height of his power, and could not bear to attack him afterward when he was down. But these scribblers, when once Hyperbolus has given them a handle, keep ever trampling on this wretched man and his mother. Eupolis, indeed, first of all craftily introduced his Maricas, having basely, base fellow, spoiled by altering my play of the Knights, having added to it, for the sake of the cordax, a drunken old woman, whom Phrynichus long ago poetized, whom the whale was for devouring. Then again Hermippus made verses on Hyperbolus; and now all others press hard upon Hyperbolus, imitating my simile of the eels. Whoever, therefore, laughs at these, let him not take pleasure in my attempts; but if you are delighted with me and my inventions, in times to come you will seem to be wise.	ὦ θεώμενοι κατερῶ πρὸς ὑμᾶς ἐλευθέρως τἀληθῆ νὴ τὸν Διόνυσον τὸν ἐκθρέψαντά με. οὕτω νικήσαιμί τʼ ἐγὼ καὶ νομιζοίμην σοφός, ὡς ὑμᾶς ἡγούμενος εἶναι θεατὰς δεξιοὺς καὶ ταύτην σοφώτατʼ ἔχειν τῶν ἐμῶν κωμῳδιῶν, πρώτους ἠξίωσʼ ἀναγεῦσʼ ὑμᾶς, ἣ παρέσχε μοι ἔργον πλεῖστον· εἶτʼ ἀνεχώρουν ὑπʼ ἀνδρῶν φορτικῶν ἡττηθεὶς οὐκ ἄξιος ὤν· ταῦτʼ οὖν ὑμῖν μέμφομαι τοῖς σοφοῖς, ὧν οὕνεκʼ ἐγὼ ταῦτʼ ἐπραγματευόμην. ἀλλʼ οὐδʼ ὣς ὑμῶν ποθʼ ἑκὼν προδώσω τοὺς δεξιούς. ἐξ ὅτου γὰρ ἐνθάδʼ ὑπʼ ἀνδρῶν, οἷς ἡδὺ καὶ λέγειν, ὁ σώφρων τε χὠ καταπύγων ἄριστʼ ἠκουσάτην, κἀγώ, παρθένος γὰρ ἔτʼ ἦν, κοὐκ ἐξῆν πώ μοι τεκεῖν, ἐξέθηκα, παῖς δʼ ἑτέρα τις λαβοῦσʼ ἀνείλετο, ὑμεῖς δʼ ἐξεθρέψατε γενναίως κἀπαιδεύσατε· ἐκ τούτου μοι πιστὰ παρʼ ὑμῖν γνώμης ἔσθʼ ὅρκια. νῦν οὖν Ἠλέκτραν κατʼ ἐκείνην ἥδʼ ἡ κωμῳδία ζητοῦσʼ ἦλθʼ, ἤν που ʼπιτύχῃ θεαταῖς οὕτω σοφοῖς· γνώσεται γάρ, ἤνπερ ἴδῃ, τἀδελφοῦ τὸν βόστρυχον. ὡς δὲ σώφρων ἐστὶ φύσει σκέψασθʼ· ἥτις πρῶτα μὲν οὐδὲν ἦλθε ῥαψαμένη σκυτίον καθειμένον ἐρυθρὸν ἐξ ἄκρου παχύ, τοῖς παιδίοις ἵνʼ ᾖ γέλως· οὐδʼ ἔσκωψε τοὺς φαλακρούς, οὐδὲ κόρδαχʼ εἵλκυσεν, οὐδὲ πρεσβύτης ὁ λέγων τἄπη τῇ βακτηρίᾳ τύπτει τὸν παρόντʼ ἀφανίζων πονηρὰ σκώμματα, οὐδʼ εἰσῇξε δᾷδας ἔχουσʼ, οὐδʼ ἰοὺ ἰοὺ βοᾷ, ἀλλʼ αὑτῇ καὶ τοῖς ἔπεσιν πιστεύουσʼ ἐλήλυθεν. κἀγὼ μὲν τοιοῦτος ἀνὴρ ὢν ποιητὴς οὐ κομῶ, οὐδʼ ὑμᾶς ζητῶ ʼξαπατᾶν δὶς καὶ τρὶς ταὔτʼ εἰσάγων, ἀλλʼ ἀεὶ καινὰς ἰδέας ἐσφέρων σοφίζομαι, οὐδὲν ἀλλήλαισιν ὁμοίας καὶ πάσας δεξιάς· ὃς μέγιστον ὄντα Κλέωνʼ ἔπαισʼ ἐς τὴν γαστέρα, κοὐκ ἐτόλμησʼ αὖθις ἐπεμπηδῆσʼ αὐτῷ κειμένῳ. οὗτοι δʼ, ὡς ἅπαξ παρέδωκεν λαβὴν Ὑπέρβολος, τοῦτον δείλαιον κολετρῶσʼ ἀεὶ καὶ τὴν μητέρα.

I first invoke, to join our choral band, the mighty Jupiter, ruling on high, the monarch of gods; and the potent master of the trident, the fierce upheaver of earth and briny sea; and our father of great renown, most august Aether, life-supporter of all; and the horse-guider, who fills the plain of the earth with exceeding bright beams, a mighty deity among gods and mortals.	ὑψιμέδοντα μὲν θεῶν Ζῆνα τύραννον ἐς χορὸν πρῶτα μέγαν κικλήσκω· τόν τε μεγασθενῆ τριαίνης ταμίαν, γῆς τε καὶ ἁλμυρᾶς θαλάσσης ἄγριον μοχλευτήν· καὶ μεγαλώνυμον ἡμέτερον πατέρʼ Αἰθέρα σεμνότατον βιοθρέμμονα πάντων· τόν θʼ ἱππονώμαν, ὃς ὑπερλάμπροις ἀκτῖσιν κατέχει γῆς πέδον μέγας ἐν θεοῖς ἐν θνητοῖσί τε δαίμων.
Most clever spectators, come, give us your attention; for having been injured, we blame you to your faces. For though we benefit the state most of all the gods, to us alone of the deities you do not offer sacrifice nor yet pour libations, who watch over you. For if there should be any expedition without prudence, then we either thunder or drizzle small rain. And then, when you were for choosing as your general the Paphlagonian tanner, hateful to the gods, we contracted our brows and were enraged; and thunder burst through the lightning; and the Moon forsook her usual paths; and the Sun immediately drew in his wick to himself, and declared he would not give you light, if Cleon should be your general. Nevertheless you chose him. For they say that ill counsel is in this city; that the gods, however, turn all these your mismanagements to a prosperous issue. And how this also shall be advantageous, we will easily teach you. If you should convict the cormorant Cleon of bribery and embezzlement, and then make fast his neck in the stocks, the affair will turn out for the state to the ancient form again, if you have mismanaged in any way, and to a prosperous issue.	ὦ σοφώτατοι θεαταὶ δεῦρο τὸν νοῦν προσέχετε. ἠδικημέναι γὰρ ὑμῖν μεμφόμεσθʼ ἐναντίον· πλεῖστα γὰρ θεῶν ἁπάντων ὠφελούσαις τὴν πόλιν, δαιμόνων ἡμῖν μόναις οὐ θύετʼ οὐδὲ σπένδετε, αἵτινες τηροῦμεν ὑμᾶς. ἢν γὰρ ᾖ τις ἔξοδος μηδενὶ ξὺν νῷ, τότʼ ἢ βροντῶμεν ἢ ψακάζομεν. εἶτα τὸν θεοῖσιν ἐχθρὸν βυρσοδέψην Παφλαγόνα ἡνίχʼ ᾑρεῖσθε στρατηγόν, τὰς ὀφρῦς συνήγομεν κἀποιοῦμεν δεινά, βροντὴ δʼ ἐρράγη διʼ ἀστραπῆς· ἡ σελήνη δʼ ἐξέλειπε τὰς ὁδούς, ὁ δʼ ἥλιος τὴν θρυαλλίδʼ εἰς ἑαυτὸν εὐθέως ξυνελκύσας οὐ φανεῖν ἔφασκεν ὑμῖν, εἰ στρατηγήσει Κλέων. ἀλλʼ ὅμως εἵλεσθε τοῦτον. φασὶ γὰρ δυσβουλίαν τῇδε τῇ πόλει προσεῖναι, ταῦτα μέντοι τοὺς θεοὺς ἅττʼ ἂν ὑμεῖς ἐξαμάρτητʼ ἐπὶ τὸ βέλτιον τρέπειν. ὡς δὲ καὶ τοῦτο ξυνοίσει ῥᾳδίως διδάξομεν· ἢν Κλέωνα τὸν λάρον δώρων ἑλόντες καὶ κλοπῆς εἶτα φιμώσητε τούτου τῷ ξύλῳ τὸν αὐχένα, αὖθις ἐς τἀρχαῖον ὑμῖν, εἴ τι κἀξημάρτετε, ἐπὶ τὸ βέλτιον τὸ πρᾶγμα τῇ πόλει συνοίσεται.
Hear me again, King Phoebus, Delian Apollo, who inhabitest the high-peaked Cynthian rock! And thou, blessed goddess, who inhabitest the all-golden house of Ephesus , in which Lydian damsels greatly reverence thee; and thou, our national goddess, swayer of the aegis, Minerva, guardian of the city! And thou, reveler Bacchus, who, inhabiting the Parnassian rock, sparklest with torches, conspicuous among the Delphic Bacchanals!	ἀμφί μοι αὖτε Φοῖβʼ ἄναξ Δήλιε Κυνθίαν ἔχων ὑψικέρατα πέτραν, ἥ τʼ Ἐφέσου μάκαιρα πάγχρυσον ἔχεις οἶκον ἐν ᾧ κόραι σε Λυδῶν μεγάλως σέβουσιν, ἥ τʼ ἐπιχώριος ἡμετέρα θεὸς αἰγίδος ἡνίοχος πολιοῦχος Ἀθάνα, Παρνασσίαν θʼ ὃς κατέχων πέτραν σὺν πεύκαις σελαγεῖ Βάκχαις Δελφίσιν ἐμπρέπων, κωμαστὴς Διόνυσος.
When we had got ready to set out hither, the Moon met us, and commanded us first to greet the Athenians and their allies; and then declared that she was angry, for that she had suffered dreadful things, though she benefits you all, not in words, but openly. In the first place, not less than a drachma every month for torches; so that also all, when they went out of an evening, were wont to say, Boy, don't buy a torch, for the moonlight is beautiful. And she says she confers other benefits on you, but that you do not observe the days at all correctly, but confuse them up and down; so that she says the gods are constantly threatening her, when they are defrauded of their dinner, and depart home, not having met with the regular feast according to the number of the days. And then, when you ought to be sacrificing, you are inflicting tortures and litigating. And often, while we gods are observing a fast, when we mourn for Memnon or Sarpedon, you are pouring libations and laughing. For which reason Hyperbolus, having obtained the lot this year to be Hieromnemon, was afterward deprived by us gods of his crown; for thus he will know better that he ought to spend the days of his life according to the Moon.	ἡνίχʼ ἡμεῖς δεῦρʼ ἀφορμᾶσθαι παρεσκευάσμεθα, ἡ σελήνη συντυχοῦσʼ ἡμῖν ἐπέστειλεν φράσαι, πρῶτα μὲν χαίρειν Ἀθηναίοισι καὶ τοῖς ξυμμάχοις· εἶτα θυμαίνειν ἔφασκε· δεινὰ γὰρ πεπονθέναι ὠφελοῦσʼ ὑμᾶς ἅπαντας οὐ λόγοις ἀλλʼ ἐμφανῶς. πρῶτα μὲν τοῦ μηνὸς ἐς δᾷδʼ οὐκ ἔλαττον ἢ δραχμήν, ὥστε καὶ λέγειν ἅπαντας ἐξιόντας ἑσπέρας, μὴ πρίῃ παῖ δᾷδʼ, ἐπειδὴ φῶς σεληναίας καλόν. ἄλλα τʼ εὖ δρᾶν φησιν, ὑμᾶς δʼ οὐκ ἄγειν τὰς ἡμέρας οὐδὲν ὀρθῶς, ἀλλʼ ἄνω τε καὶ κάτω κυδοιδοπᾶν· ὥστʼ ἀπειλεῖν φησιν αὐτῇ τοὺς θεοὺς ἑκάστοτε ἡνίκʼ ἂν ψευσθῶσι δείπνου κἀπίωσιν οἴκαδε, τῆς ἑορτῆς μὴ τυχόντες κατὰ λόγον τῶν ἡμερῶν. κᾆθʼ ὅταν θύειν δέῃ, στρεβλοῦτε καὶ δικάζετε· πολλάκις δʼ ἡμῶν ἀγόντων τῶν θεῶν ἀπαστίαν, ἡνίκʼ ἂν πενθῶμεν ἢ τὸν Μέμνονʼ ἢ Σαρπηδόνα, σπένδεθʼ ὑμεῖς καὶ γελᾶτʼ· ἀνθʼ ὧν λαχὼν Ὑπέρβολος τῆτες ἱερομνημονεῖν, κἄπειθʼ ὑφʼ ἡμῶν τῶν θεῶν τὸν στέφανον ἀφῃρέθη· μᾶλλον γὰρ οὕτως εἴσεται κατὰ σελήνην ὡς ἄγειν χρὴ τοῦ βίου τὰς ἡμέρας.
By Respiration, and Chaos, and Air, I have not seen any man so boorish, nor so impracticable, nor so stupid, nor so forgetful; who, while learning some little petty quibbles, forgets them before he has learned them. Nevertheless I will certainly call him out here to the light. Where is Strepsiades? Come forth with your couch. (from within). The bugs do not permit me to bring it forth. Make haste and lay it down; and give me your attention. Very well. Come now; what do you now wish to learn first of those things in none of which you have ever been instructed? Tell me. About measures, or rhythms, or verses? I should prefer to learn about measures; for it is but lately I was cheated out of two choenices by a meal-huckster. I do not ask you this, but which you account the most beautiful measure; the trimetre or the tetrameter? Make a wager then with me, if the semisextarius be not a tetrameter. Go to the devil! How boorish you are and dull of learning. Perhaps you may be able to learn about rhythms. But what good will rhythms do me for a living? In the first place, to be clever at an entertainment, understanding what rhythm is for the war-dance, and what, again, according to the dactyle. According to the dactyle? By Jove, but I know it! Tell me, pray. What else but this finger? Formerly, indeed, when I was yet a boy, this here! You are boorish and stupid. For I do not desire, you wretch, to learn any of these things. What then? That, that, the most unjust cause.	μὰ τὴν Ἀναπνοὴν μὰ τὸ Χάος μὰ τὸν Ἀέρα οὐκ εἶδον οὕτως ἄνδρʼ ἄγροικον οὐδένα οὐδʼ ἄπορον οὐδὲ σκαιὸν οὐδʼ ἐπιλήσμονα· ὅστις σκαλαθυρμάτιʼ ἄττα μικρὰ μανθάνων ταῦτʼ ἐπιλέλησται πρὶν μαθεῖν· ὅμως γε μὴν αὐτὸν καλῶ θύραζε δευρὶ πρὸς τὸ φῶς. ποῦ Στρεψιάδης; ἔξει τὸν ἀσκάντην λαβών; ἀλλʼ οὐκ ἐῶσί μʼ ἐξενεγκεῖν οἱ κόρεις. ἀνύσας τι κατάθου καὶ πρόσεχε τὸν νοῦν. ἰδού. ἄγε δὴ τί βούλει πρῶτα νυνὶ μανθάνειν ὧν οὐκ ἐδιδάχθης πώποτʼ οὐδέν; εἰπέ μοι. πότερα περὶ μέτρων ἢ περὶ ἐπῶν ἢ ῥυθμῶν; περὶ τῶν μέτρων ἔγωγʼ· ἔναγχος γάρ ποτε ὑπʼ ἀλφιταμοιβοῦ παρεκόπην διχοινίκῳ. οὐ τοῦτʼ ἐρωτῶ σʼ, ἀλλʼ ὅ τι κάλλιστον μέτρον ἡγεῖ· πότερα τὸ τρίμετρον ἢ τὸ τετράμετρον; ἐγὼ μὲν οὐδὲν πρότερον ἡμιεκτέου. οὐδὲν λέγεις ὦνθρωπε. περίδου νυν ἐμοί, εἰ μὴ τετράμετρόν ἐστιν ἡμιεκτέον. ἐς κόρακας, ὡς ἄγροικος εἶ καὶ δυσμαθής. ταχύ γʼ ἂν δύναιο μανθάνειν περὶ ῥυθμῶν. τί δέ μʼ ὠφελήσουσʼ οἱ ῥυθμοὶ πρὸς τἄλφιτα; πρῶτον μὲν εἶναι κομψὸν ἐν συνουσίᾳ, ἐπαΐονθʼ ὁποῖός ἐστι τῶν ῥυθμῶν κατʼ ἐνόπλιον, χὠποῖος αὖ κατὰ δάκτυλον. κατὰ δάκτυλον; νὴ τὸν Δίʼ, ἀλλʼ οἶδʼ. εἰπὲ δή. τίς ἄλλος ἀντὶ τουτουὶ τοῦ δακτύλου; πρὸ τοῦ μέν, ἔτʼ ἐμοῦ παιδὸς ὄντος, οὑτοσί. ἀγρεῖος εἶ καὶ σκαιός. οὐ γὰρ ᾠζυρὲ τούτων ἐπιθυμῶ μανθάνειν οὐδέν. τί δαί; ἐκεῖνʼ ἐκεῖνο, τὸν ἀδικώτατον λόγον.
But you must learn other things before these; namely, what quadrupeds are properly masculine. I know the males, if I am not mad-krios, tragos, tauros, kuon, alektryon. Do you see what you are doing? You are calling both the female and the male alektryon in the same way. How, pray? Come, tell me. How? The one with you is alektryon, and the other is alektryon also. Yea, by Neptune! How now ought I to call them? The one alektryaina and the other alektor. Alektryaina? Capital, by the Air! So that, in return for this lesson alone, I will fill your kardopos full of barley-meal on all sides. See! See! There again is another blunder! You make kardopos, which is feminine, to be masculine. In what way do I make kardopos masculine? Most assuredly; just as if you were to say Cleonymos. Good sir, Cleonymus had no kneading-trough, but kneaded his bread in a round mortar. How ought I to call it henceforth? How? Call it kardope, as you call Sostrate. Kardope in the feminine? For so you speak it rightly. But that would make it kardope, Kleonyme. You must learn one thing more about names, what are masculine and what of them are feminine. I know what are female. Tell me, pray. Lysilla, Philinna, Clitagora, Demetria. What names are masculine? Thousands; Philoxenus, Melesias, Amynias. But, you wretch! These are not masculine. Are they not males with you? By no means; for how would you call Amynias, if you met him? How would I call? Thus: Come hither, come hither Amynia! Do you see ? You call Amynias a woman. Is it not then with justice, who does not serve in the army? But why should I learn these things, that we all know? It is no use, by Jupiter! Having reclined yourself down here- What must I do? Think out some of your own affairs. Not here, pray, I beseech you; but, if I must, suffer me to excogitate these very things on the ground. There is no other way. Unfortunate man that I am! What a penalty shall I this day pay to the bugs!	ἀλλʼ ἕτερα δεῖ σε πρότερα τούτου μανθάνειν, τῶν τετραπόδων ἅττʼ ἐστὶν ὀρθῶς ἄρρενα. ἀλλʼ οἶδʼ ἔγωγε τἄρρενʼ, εἰ μὴ μαίνομαι· κριὸς τράγος ταῦρος κύων ἀλεκτρυών. ὁρᾷς ὃ πάσχεις; τήν τε θήλειαν καλεῖς ἀλεκτρυόνα κατὰ ταὐτὸ καὶ τὸν ἄρρενα. πῶς δὴ φέρʼ; ὅπως; ἀλεκτρυὼν κἀλεκτρυών. νὴ τὸν Ποσειδῶ. νῦν δὲ πῶς με χρὴ καλεῖν; ἀλεκτρύαιναν, τὸν δʼ ἕτερον ἀλέκτορα. ἀλεκτρύαιναν; εὖ γε νὴ τὸν Ἀέρα· ὥστʼ ἀντὶ τούτου τοῦ διδάγματος μόνου διαλφιτώσω σου κύκλῳ τὴν κάρδοπον. ἰδοὺ μάλʼ αὖθις τοῦθʼ ἕτερον· τὴν κάρδοπον ἄρρενα καλεῖς θήλειαν οὖσαν. τῷ τρόπῳ ἄρρενα καλῶ ʼγὼ κάρδοπον; μάλιστά γε, ὥσπερ γε καὶ Κλεώνυμον. πῶς δή; φράσον. ταὐτὸν δύναταί σοι κάρδοπος Κλεωνύμῳ. ἀλλʼ ὦγάθʼ οὐδʼ ἦν κάρδοπος Κλεωνύμῳ, ἀλλʼ ἐν θυείᾳ στρογγύλῃ γʼ ἂν ἐμάττετο. ἀτὰρ τὸ λοιπὸν πῶς με χρὴ καλεῖν; ὅπως; τὴν καρδόπην, ὥσπερ καλεῖς τὴν Σωστράτην. τὴν καρδόπην θήλειαν; ὀρθῶς γὰρ λέγεις. ἐκεῖνο δʼ ἦν ἄν, καρδόπη, Κλεωνύμη. ἔτι δή γε περὶ τῶν ὀνομάτων μαθεῖν σε δεῖ, ἅττʼ ἄρρενʼ ἐστίν, ἅττα δʼ αὐτῶν θήλεα. ἀλλʼ οἶδʼ ἔγωγʼ ἃ θήλεʼ ἐστίν. εἰπὲ δή.

Now meditate and examine closely; and roll yourself about in every way, having wrapped yourself up; and quickly, when you fall into a difficulty, spring to another mental contrivance. But let delightful sleep be absent from your eyes.	φρόντιζε δὴ καὶ διάθρει πάντα τρόπον τε σαυτὸν στρόβει πυκνώσας. ταχὺς δʼ, ὅταν εἰς ἄπορον πέσῃς, ἐπʼ ἄλλο πήδα νόημα φρενός· ὕπνος δʼ ἀπέστω γλυκύθυμος ὀμμάτων.
Attatai! Attatai! What ails you? Why are you distressed? Wretched man, I am perishing! The Corinthians, coming out from the bed, are biting me, and devouring my sides, and drinking up my life-blood, and tearing away my flesh, and digging through my vitals, and will annihilate me. Do not now be very grievously distressed. Why, how, when my money is gone, my complexion gone, my life gone, and my slipper gone? And furthermore in addition to these evils, with singing the night-watches, I am almost gone myself. Ho you! What are you about? Are you not meditating? I? Yea, by Neptune! And what, pray, have you thought? Whether any bit of me will be left by the bugs. You will perish most wretchedly. But, my good friend, I have already perished. You must not give in, but must wrap yourself up; for you have to discover a device for abstracting, and a means of cheating. Ah me! Would, pray, some one would throw over me a swindling contrivance from the sheep-skins.	ἀτταταῖ ἀτταταῖ. τί πάσχεις; τί κάμνεις; ἀπόλλυμαι δείλαιος· ἐκ τοῦ σκίμποδος δάκνουσί μʼ ἐξέρποντες οἱ Κορίνθιοι, καὶ τὰς πλευρὰς δαρδάπτουσιν καὶ τὴν ψυχὴν ἐκπίνουσιν καὶ τοὺς ὄρχεις ἐξέλκουσιν καὶ τὸν πρωκτὸν διορύττουσιν, καί μʼ ἀπολοῦσιν. μή νυν βαρέως ἄλγει λίαν. καὶ πῶς; ὅτε μου φροῦδα τὰ χρήματα, φρούδη χροιά, φρούδη ψυχή, φρούδη δʼ ἐμβάς· καὶ πρὸς τούτοις ἔτι τοῖσι κακοῖς φρουρᾶς ᾄδων ὀλίγου φροῦδος γεγένημαι. οὗτος τί ποιεῖς; οὐχὶ φροντίζεις; ἐγώ; νὴ τὸν Ποσειδῶ. καὶ τί δῆτʼ ἐφρόντισας; ὑπὸ τῶν κόρεων εἴ μού τι περιλειφθήσεται. ἀπολεῖ κάκιστʼ. ἀλλʼ ὦγάθʼ ἀπόλωλʼ ἀρτίως. οὐ μαλθακιστέʼ ἀλλὰ περικαλυπτέα. ἐξευρετέος γὰρ νοῦς ἀποστερητικὸς κἀπαιόλημʼ. οἴμοι τίς ἂν δῆτʼ ἐπιβάλοι ἐξ ἀρνακίδων γνώμην ἀποστερητρίδα;
Come now; I will first see this fellow, what he is about. Ho you! Are you asleep? No, by Apollo, I am not! Have you got anything? No; by Jupiter, certainly not! Nothing at all? Nothing, except what I have in my right hand. Will you not quickly cover yourself up and think of something? About what? For do you tell me this, O Socrates! Do you, yourself, first find out and state what you wish. You have heard a thousand times what I wish. About the interest; so that I may pay no one. Come then, wrap yourself up, and having given your mind play with subtilty, revolve your affairs by little and little, rightly distinguishing and examining. Ah me, unhappy man! Keep quiet; and if you be puzzled in any one of your conceptions, leave it and go; and then set your mind in motion again, and lock it up. (in great glee). O dearest little Socrates! What, old man? I have got a device for cheating them of the interest. Exhibit it. Now tell me this, pray; if I were to purchase a Thessalian witch, and draw down the moon by night, and then shut it up, as if it were a mirror, in a round crest-case, and then carefully keep it- What good, pray, would this do you? What? If the moon were to rise no longer anywhere, I should not pay the interest. Why so, pray? Because the money is lent out by the month. Capital! But I will again propose to you another clever question. If a suit of five talents should be entered against you, tell me how you would obliterate it. How? How? I do not know but I must seek. Do not then always revolve your thoughts about yourself; but slack away your mind into the air, like a cock-chafer tied with a thread by the foot. I have found a very clever method of getting rid of my suit, so that you yourself would acknowledge it. Of what description? Have you ever seen this stone in the chemist's shops, the beautiful and transparent one, from which they kindle fire? Do you mean the burning-glass? I do. Come what would you say, pray, if I were to take this, when the clerk was entering the suit, and were to stand at a distance, in the direction of the sun, thus, and melt out the letters of my suit? Cleverly done, by the Graces! Oh! How I am delighted, that a suit of five talents has been cancelled! Come now, quickly seize upon this. What?	φέρε νυν ἀθρήσω πρῶτον ὅ τι δρᾷ τουτονί. οὗτος καθεύδεις; μὰ τὸν Ἀπόλλω ʼγὼ μὲν οὔ. ἔχεις τι; μὰ Δίʼ οὐ δῆτʼ ἔγωγʼ. οὐδὲν πάνυ; οὐδέν γε πλὴν ἢ τὸ πέος ἐν τῇ δεξιᾷ. οὐκ ἐγκαλυψάμενος ταχέως τι φροντιεῖς; περὶ τοῦ; σὺ γάρ μοι τοῦτο φράσον ὦ Σώκρατες. αὐτὸς ὅ τι βούλει πρῶτος ἐξευρὼν λέγε. ἀκήκοας μυριάκις ἁγὼ βούλομαι, περὶ τῶν τόκων, ὅπως ἂν ἀποδῶ μηδενί. ἴθι νῦν καλύπτου καὶ σχάσας τὴν φροντίδα λεπτὴν κατὰ μικρὸν περιφρόνει τὰ πράγματα, ὀρθῶς διαιρῶν καὶ σκοπῶν. οἴμοι τάλας. ἔχʼ ἀτρέμα· κἂν ἀπορῇς τι τῶν νοημάτων, ἀφεὶς ἄπελθε, κατὰ τὴν γνώμην πάλιν κίνησον αὖθις αὐτὸ καὶ ζυγώθρισον. ὦ Σωκρατίδιον φίλτατον. τί ὦ γέρον; ἔχω τόκου γνώμην ἀποστερητικήν. ἐπίδειξον αὐτήν. εἰπὲ δή νύν μοι — τὸ τί; γυναῖκα φαρμακίδʼ εἰ πριάμενος Θετταλὴν καθέλοιμι νύκτωρ τὴν σελήνην, εἶτα δὴ αὐτὴν καθείρξαιμʼ ἐς λοφεῖον στρογγύλον, ὥσπερ κάτοπτρον, κᾆτα τηροίην ἔχων — τί δῆτα τοῦτʼ ἂν ὠφελήσειέν σʼ; ὅ τι; εἰ μηκέτʼ ἀνατέλλοι σελήνη μηδαμοῦ, οὐκ ἂν ἀποδοίην τοὺς τόκους. ὁτιὴ τί δή; ὁτιὴ κατὰ μῆνα τἀγύριον δανείζεται. εὖ γʼ· ἀλλʼ ἕτερον αὖ σοι προβαλῶ τι δεξιόν. εἴ σοι γράφοιτο πεντετάλαντός τις δίκη, ὅπως ἂν αὐτὴν ἀφανίσειας εἰπέ μοι. ὅπως; ὅπως; οὐκ οἶδʼ· ἀτὰρ ζητητέον. μή νυν περὶ σαυτὸν εἶλλε τὴν γνώμην ἀεί, ἀλλʼ ἀποχάλα τὴν φροντίδʼ ἐς τὸν ἀέρα λινόδετον ὥσπερ μηλολόνθην τοῦ ποδός. ηὕρηκʼ ἀφάνισιν τῆς δίκης σοφωτάτην, ὥστʼ αὐτὸν ὁμολογεῖν σʼ ἐμοί. ποίαν τινά; ἤδη παρὰ τοῖσι φαρμακοπώλαις τὴν λίθον ταύτην ἑόρακας τὴν καλήν, τὴν διαφανῆ, ἀφʼ ἧς τὸ πῦρ ἅπτουσι; τὴν ὕαλον λέγεις; ἔγωγε. φέρε τί δῆτʼ ἄν, εἰ ταύτην λαβών, ὁπότε γράφοιτο τὴν δίκην ὁ γραμματεύς, ἀπωτέρω στὰς ὧδε πρὸς τὸν ἥλιον τὰ γράμματʼ ἐκτήξαιμι τῆς ἐμῆς δίκης; σοφῶς γε νὴ τὰς Χάριτας. οἴμʼ ὡς ἥδομαι ὅτι πεντετάλαντος διαγέγραπταί μοι δίκη. ἄγε δὴ ταχέως τουτὶ ξυνάρπασον. τὸ τί;
How, when engaged in a lawsuit, you could overturn the suit, when you were about to be cast, because you had no witnesses. Most readily and easily. Tell me, pray. Well now, I'll tell you. If, while one suit was still pending, before mine was called on, I were to run away and hang myself. You talk nonsense. By the gods, would I! For no one will bring action against me when I am dead. You talk nonsense. Begone; I can't teach you any longer. Why so? Yea, by the gods, O Socrates! You straightaway forget whatever you learn. For what now was the first thing you were taught? Tell me. Come, let me see: nay, what was the first? What was the fist? Nay, what was the thing in which we knead our flour? Ah me! What was it? Will you not pack off to the devil, you most forgetful and most stupid old man? Ah me, what then, pray will become of me, wretched man? For I shall be utterly undone, if I do not learn to ply the tongue. Come, O ye Clouds, give me some good advice. We, old man, advise you, if you have a son grown up, to send him to learn in your stead. Well, I have a fine, handsome son, but he is not willing to learn. What must I do? But do you permit him? Yes, for he is robust in body, and in good health, and is come of the high-plumed dames of Coesyra. I will go for him, and if he be not willing, I will certainly drive him from my house. Go in and wait for me a short time.	ὅπως ἀποστρέψαιʼ ἂν ἀντιδικῶν δίκην μέλλων ὀφλήσειν μὴ παρόντων μαρτύρων. φαυλότατα καὶ ῥᾷστʼ. εἰπὲ δή. καὶ δὴ λέγω. εἰ πρόσθεν ἔτι μιᾶς ἐνεστώσης δίκης, πρὶν τὴν ἐμὴν καλεῖσθʼ, ἀπαγξαίμην τρέχων. οὐδὲν λέγεις. νὴ τοὺς θεοὺς ἔγωγʼ, ἐπεὶ οὐδεὶς κατʼ ἐμοῦ τεθνεῶτος εἰσάξει δίκην. ὑθλεῖς· ἄπερρʼ, οὐκ ἂν διδάξαιμʼ ἄν σʼ ἔτι. ὁτιὴ τί; ναὶ πρὸς τῶν θεῶν ὦ Σώκρατες. ἀλλʼ εὐθὺς ἐπιλήθει σύ γʼ ἅττʼ ἂν καὶ μάθῃς· ἐπεὶ τί νυνὶ πρῶτον ἐδιδάχθης; λέγε. φέρʼ ἴδω τί μέντοι πρῶτον ἦν; τί πρῶτον ἦν; τίς ἦν ἐν ᾗ ʼματτόμεθα μέντοι τἄλφιτα; οἴμοι τίς ἦν; οὐκ ἐς κόρακας ἀποφθερεῖ, ἐπιλησμότατον καὶ σκαιότατον γερόντιον; οἴμοι τί οὖν δῆθʼ ὁ κακοδαίμων πείσομαι; ἀπὸ γὰρ ὀλοῦμαι μὴ μαθὼν γλωττοστροφεῖν. ἀλλʼ ὦ Νεφέλαι χρηστόν τι συμβουλεύσατε. ἡμεῖς μὲν ὦ πρεσβῦτα συμβουλεύομεν, εἴ σοί τις υἱός ἐστιν ἐκτεθραμμένος, πέμπειν ἐκεῖνον ἀντὶ σαυτοῦ μανθάνειν. ἀλλʼ ἔστʼ ἔμοιγʼ υἱὸς καλός τε κἀγαθός· ἀλλʼ οὐκ ἐθέλει γὰρ μανθάνειν. τί ἐγὼ πάθω; σὺ δʼ ἐπιτρέπεις; εὐσωματεῖ γὰρ καὶ σφριγᾷ, κἄστʼ ἐκ γυναικῶν εὐπτέρων τῶν Κοισύρας. ἀτὰρ μέτειμί γʼ αὐτόν· ἢν δὲ μὴ ʼθέλῃ, οὐκ ἔσθʼ ὅπως οὐκ ἐξελῶ κʼ τῆς οἰκίας. ἀλλʼ ἐπανάμεινόν μʼ ὀλίγον εἰσελθὼν χρόνον.
Do you perceive that you are soon to obtain the greatest benefits through us alone of the gods? For this man is ready to do everything that you bid him. But you, while the man is astounded and evidently elated, having perceived it, will quickly fleece him to the best of your power. For matters of this sort are somehow accustomed to turn the other way.	ἆρʼ αἰσθάνει πλεῖστα διʼ ἡμᾶς ἀγάθʼ αὐτίχʼ ἕξων μόνας θεῶν; ὡς ἕτοιμος ὅδʼ ἐστὶν ἅπαντα δρᾶν ὅσʼ ἂν κελεύῃς. σὺ δʼ ἀνδρὸς ἐκπεπληγμένου καὶ φανερῶς ἐπηρμένου γνοὺς ἀπολάψεις ὅ τι πλεῖστον δύνασαι, ταχέως· φιλεῖ γάρ πως τὰ τοιαῦθʼ ἑτέρᾳ τρέπεσθαι.
By Mist, you certainly shall not stay here any longer! But go and gnaw the columns of Megacles. My good sir, what is the matter with you, O father? You are not in your senses, by Olympian Jupiter! See, see, Olympian Jupiter! What folly! To think of your believing in Jupiter, as old as you are! Why, pray, did you laugh at this? Reflecting that you are a child, and have antiquated notions. Yet, however, approach, that you may know more; and I will tell you a thing, by learning which you will be a man. But see that you do not teach this to any one. Well, what is it? You swore now by Jupiter. I did. Seest thou, then, how good a thing is learning? There is no Jupiter, O Phidippides! Who then? Vortex reigns, having expelled Jupiter. Bah! Why do you talk foolishly? Be assured that it is so. Who says this? Socrates the Melian, and Chaerephon, who knows the footmarks of fleas. Have you arrived at such a pitch of frenzy that you believe madmen? Speak words of good omen, and say nothing bad of clever men and wise; of whom, through frugality, none ever shaved or anointed himself, or went to a bath to wash himself; while you squander my property in bathing, as if I were already dead. But go as quickly as possible and learn instead of me. What good could any one learn from them? What, really? Whatever wisdom there is among men. And you will know yourself, how ignorant and stupid you are. But wait for me here a short time. Ah me! What shall I do, my father being crazed? Shall I bring him into court and convict him of lunacy, or shall I give information of his madness to the coffin-makers? Come, let me see; what do you consider this to be? Tell me. Alectryon. Right. And what this? Alectryon. Both the same? You are very ridiculous. Do not do so, then, for the future; but call this alektryaina, and this one alektor. Alektryaina! Did you learn these clever things by going in just now to the Titans?	οὔτοι μὰ τὴν Ὁμίχλην ἔτʼ ἐνταυθοῖ μενεῖς· ἀλλʼ ἔσθιʼ ἐλθὼν τοὺς Μεγακλέους κίονας. ὦ δαιμόνιε, τί χρῆμα πάσχεις ὦ πάτερ; οὐκ εὖ φρονεῖς μὰ τὸν Δία τὸν Ὀλύμπιον. ἰδού γʼ ἰδού, Δίʼ Ὀλύμπιον· τῆς μωρίας, τὸν Δία νομίζειν ὄντα τηλικουτονί. τί δὲ τοῦτʼ ἐγέλασας ἐτεόν; ἐνθυμούμενος ὅτι παιδάριον εἶ καὶ φρονεῖς ἀρχαιϊκά. ὅμως γε μὴν πρόσελθʼ, ἵνʼ εἰδῇς πλείονα, καί σοι φράσω τι πρᾶγμʼ ὃ μαθὼν ἀνὴρ ἔσει. ὅπως δὲ τοῦτο μὴ διδάξεις μηδένα. ἰδού· τί ἔστιν; ὤμοσας νυνὶ Δία. ἔγωγʼ. ὁρᾷς οὖν ὡς ἀγαθὸν τὸ μανθάνειν; οὐκ ἔστιν ὦ Φειδιππίδη Ζεύς. ἀλλὰ τίς; Δῖνος βασιλεύει τὸν Δίʼ ἐξεληλακώς. αἰβοῖ τί ληρεῖς; ἴσθι τοῦθʼ οὕτως ἔχον. τίς φησι ταῦτα; Σωκράτης ὁ Μήλιος καὶ Χαιρεφῶν, ὃς οἶδε τὰ ψυλλῶν ἴχνη. σὺ δʼ ἐς τοσοῦτον τῶν μανιῶν ἐλήλυθας ὥστʼ ἀνδράσιν πείθει χολῶσιν; εὐστόμει καὶ μηδὲν εἴπῃς φλαῦρον ἄνδρας δεξιοὺς καὶ νοῦν ἔχοντας· ὧν ὑπὸ τῆς φειδωλίας ἀπεκείρατʼ οὐδεὶς πώποτʼ οὐδʼ ἠλείψατο, οὐδʼ ἐς βαλανεῖον ἦλθε λουσόμενος· σὺ δὲ ὥσπερ τεθνεῶτος καταλόει μου τὸν βίον. ἀλλʼ ὡς τάχιστʼ ἐλθὼν ὑπὲρ ἐμοῦ μάνθανε. τί δʼ ἂν παρʼ ἐκείνων καὶ μάθοι χρηστόν τις ἄν; ἄληθες; ὅσαπερ ἔστʼ ἐν ἀνθρώποις σοφά· γνώσει δὲ σαυτὸν ὡς ἀμαθὴς εἶ καὶ παχύς. ἀλλʼ ἐπανάμεινόν μʼ ὀλίγον ἐνταυθοῖ χρόνον. οἴμοι τί δράσω παραφρονοῦντος τοῦ πατρός; πότερον παρανοίας αὐτὸν εἰσαγαγὼν ἕλω, ἢ τοῖς σοροπηγοῖς τὴν μανίαν αὐτοῦ φράσω; φέρʼ ἴδω, σὺ τοῦτον τί ὀνομάζεις; εἰπέ μοι. ἀλεκτρυόνα. καλῶς γε. ταυτηνὶ δὲ τί; ἀλεκτρυόνʼ. ἄμφω ταὐτό; καταγέλαστος εἶ. μή νυν τὸ λοιπόν, ἀλλὰ τήνδε μὲν καλεῖν ἀλεκτρύαιναν τουτονὶ δʼ ἀλέκτορα. ἀλεκτρύαιναν; ταῦτʼ ἔμαθες τὰ δεξιὰ εἴσω παρελθὼν ἄρτι παρὰ τοὺς γηγενεῖς;
And many others too; but whatever I learned on each occasion I used to forget immediately, through length of years. Is it for this reason, pray, that you have also lost your cloak? I have not lost it; but have studied it away. What have you made of your slippers, you foolish man? I have expended them, like Pericles, for needful purposes. Come, move, let us go. And then if you obey your father, go wrong if you like. I also know that I formerly obeyed you, a lisping child of six years old, and bought you a go-cart at the Diasia, with the first obolus I received from the Heliaea. You will assuredly some time at length be grieved at this. It is well done of you that you obeyed. Come hither, come hither O Socrates! Come forth, for I bring to you this son of mine, having persuaded him against his will. For he is still childish, and not used to the baskets here. You would yourself be used to them if you were hanged. A mischief take you! Do you abuse your teacher? Were hanged quoth 'a! How sillily he pronounced it, and with lips wide apart! How can this youth ever learn an acquittal from a trial or a legal summons, or persuasive refutation? And yet Hyperbolus learned this at the cost of a talent. Never mind; teach him. He is clever by nature. Indeed, from his earliest years, when he was a little fellow only so big, he was wont to form houses and carve ships within-doors, and make little wagons of leather, and make frogs out of pomegranate-rinds, you can't think how cleverly. But see that he learns those two causes; the better, whatever it may be; and the worse, which, by maintaining what is unjust, overturns the better. If not both, at any rate the unjust one by all means. He shall learn it himself from the two causes in person. I will take my departure. Remember this now, that he is to be able to reply to all just arguments.	χἄτερά γε πόλλʼ· ἀλλʼ ὅ τι μάθοιμʼ ἑκάστοτε, ἐπελανθανόμην ἂν εὐθὺς ὑπὸ πλήθους ἐτῶν. διὰ ταῦτα δὴ καὶ θοἰμάτιον ἀπώλεσας; ἀλλʼ οὐκ ἀπολώλεκʼ, ἀλλὰ καταπεφρόντικα. τὰς δʼ ἐμβάδας ποῖ τέτροφας ὦνόητε σύ; ὥσπερ Περικλέης ἐς τὸ δέον ἀπώλεσα. ἀλλʼ ἴθι βάδιζʼ, ἴωμεν· εἶτα τῷ πατρὶ πιθόμενος ἐξάμαρτε· κἀγώ τοί ποτε, οἶδʼ, ἑξέτει σοι τραυλίσαντι πιθόμενος, ὃν πρῶτον ὀβολὸν ἔλαβον ἡλιαστικόν, τούτου ʼπριάμην σοι Διασίοις ἁμαξίδα. ἦ μὴν σὺ τούτοις τῷ χρόνῳ ποτʼ ἀχθέσει. εὖ γʼ ὅτι ἐπείσθης. δεῦρο δεῦρʼ ὦ Σώκρατες, ἔξελθʼ· ἄγω γάρ σοι τὸν υἱὸν τουτονὶ ἄκοντʼ ἀναπείσας. νηπύτιος γάρ ἐστʼ ἔτι, καὶ τῶν κρεμαθρῶν οὔπω τρίβων τῶν ἐνθάδε. αὐτὸς τρίβων εἴης ἄν, εἰ κρέμαιό γε. οὐκ ἐς κόρακας; καταρᾷ σὺ τῷ διδασκάλῳ; ἰδοὺ κρέμαιʼ, ὡς ἠλίθιον ἐφθέγξατο καὶ τοῖσι χείλεσιν διερρυηκόσιν. πῶς ἂν μάθοι ποθʼ οὗτος ἀπόφυξιν δίκης ἢ κλῆσιν ἢ χαύνωσιν ἀναπειστηρίαν; καίτοι γε ταλάντου τοῦτʼ ἔμαθεν Ὑπέρβολος. ἀμέλει δίδασκε· θυμόσοφός ἐστιν φύσει· εὐθύς γέ τοι παιδάριον ὄν τυννουτονὶ ἔπλαττεν ἔνδον οἰκίας ναῦς τʼ ἔγλυφεν, ἁμαξίδας τε σκυτίνας ἠργάζετο, κἀκ τῶν σιδίων βατράχους ἐποίει πῶς δοκεῖς. ὅπως δʼ ἐκείνω τὼ λόγω μαθήσεται, τὸν κρείττονʼ ὅστις ἐστὶ καὶ τὸν ἥττονα, ὃς τἄδικα λέγων ἀνατρέπει τὸν κρείττονα· ἐὰν δὲ μή, τὸν γοῦν ἄδικον πάσῃ τέχνῃ. αὐτὸς μαθήσεται παρʼ αὐτοῖν τοῖν λόγοιν. ἐγὼ δʼ ἀπέσομαι. τοῦτό νυν μέμνησʼ, ὅπως πρὸς πάντα τὰ δίκαιʼ ἀντιλέγειν δυνήσεται.
Come hither! Show yourself to the spectators, although being audacious. Go whither you please; for I shall far rather do for you, if I speak before a crowd. You destroy me? Who are you? A cause. Ay, the worse. But I conquer you, who say that you are better than I. By doing what clever trick? By discovering new contrivances. For these innovations flourish by the favour of these silly persons. No; but wise persons. I will destroy you miserably. Tell me, by doing what? By speaking what is just. But I will overturn them by contradicting them; for I deny that justice even exists at all. Do you deny that it exists? For come, where is it? With the gods. How, then, if justice exists, has Jupiter not perished, who bound his own father? Bah! This profanity now is spreading! Give me a basin. You are a dotard and absurd. You are debauched and shameless. You have spoken roses of me. And a dirty lickspittle. You crown me with lilies. And a parricide. You don't know that you are sprinkling me with gold. Certainly not so formerly, but with lead. But now this is an ornament to me. You are very impudent. And you are antiquated. And through you, no one of our youths is willing to go to school; and you will be found out some time or other by the Athenians, what sort of doctrines you teach the simple-minded.	χώρει δευρί, δεῖξον σαυτὸν τοῖσι θεαταῖς, καίπερ θρασὺς ὤν. ἴθʼ ὅποι χρῄζεις. πολὺ γὰρ μᾶλλόν ʼς ἐν τοῖς πολλοῖσι λέγων ἀπολῶ. ἀπολεῖς σύ; τίς ὤν; λόγος. ἥττων γʼ ὤν. ἀλλά σε νικῶ τὸν ἐμοῦ κρείττω φάσκοντʼ εἶναι. τί σοφὸν ποιῶν; γνώμας καινὰς ἐξευρίσκων. ταῦτα γὰρ ἀνθεῖ διὰ τουτουσὶ τοὺς ἀνοήτους. οὔκ, ἀλλὰ σοφούς. ἀπολῶ σε κακῶς. εἰπὲ τί ποιῶν; τὰ δίκαια λέγων. ἀλλʼ ἀνατρέψω γʼ αὔτʼ ἀντιλέγων· οὐδὲ γὰρ εἶναι πάνυ φημὶ δίκην. οὐκ εἶναι φῄς; φέρε γὰρ ποῦ ʼστιν; παρὰ τοῖσι θεοῖς. πῶς δῆτα δίκης οὔσης ὁ Ζεὺς οὐκ ἀπόλωλεν τὸν πατέρʼ αὑτοῦ δήσας; αἰβοῖ τουτὶ καὶ δὴ χωρεῖ τὸ κακόν· δότε μοι λεκάνην. τυφογέρων εἶ κἀνάρμοστος. καταπύγων εἶ κἀναίσχυντος. ῥόδα μʼ εἴρηκας. καὶ βωμολόχος. κρίνεσι στεφανοῖς. καὶ πατραλοίας. χρυσῷ πάττων μʼ οὐ γιγνώσκεις. οὐ δῆτα πρὸ τοῦ γʼ, ἀλλὰ μολύβδῳ. νῦν δέ γε κόσμος τοῦτʼ ἐστὶν ἐμοί. θρασὺς εἶ πολλοῦ. σὺ δέ γʼ ἀρχαῖος. διὰ σὲ δὲ φοιτᾶν οὐδεὶς ἐθέλει τῶν μειρακίων· καὶ γνωσθήσει ποτʼ Ἀθηναίοις οἶα διδάσκεις τοὺς ἀνοήτους.
You are shamefully squalid. And you are prosperous. And yet formerly you were a beggar saying that you were the Mysian Telephus, and gnawing the maxims of Pandeletus out of your little wallet. Oh, the wisdom-- Oh, the madness-- Which you have mentioned. And of your city, which supports you who ruin her youths. You shan't teach this youth, you old dotard. Yes, if he is to be saved, and not merely to practise loquacity. Come hither, and leave him to rave. You shall howl, if you lay your hand on him. Cease from contention and railing. But show to us, you, what you used to teach the men of former times, and you, the new system of education; in order that, having heard you disputing, he may decide and go to the school of one or the other. I am willing to do so. I also am willing. Come now, which of the two shall speak first? I will give him the precedence; and then, from these things which he adduces, I will shoot him dead with new words and thoughts. And at last, if he mutter, he shall be destroyed, being stung in his whole face and his two eyes by my maxims, as if by bees.	αὐχμεῖς αἰσχρῶς. σὺ δέ γʼ εὖ πράττεις. καίτοι πρότερόν γʼ ἐπτώχευες, Τήλεφος εἶναι Μυσὸς φάσκων, ἐκ πηριδίου γνώμας τρώγων Πανδελετείους. ὤμοι σοφίας — ὤμοι μανίας — ἧς ἐμνήσθης — τῆς σῆς, πόλεώς θʼ ἥτις σε τρέφει λυμαινόμενον τοῖς μειρακίοις. οὐχὶ διδάξεις τοῦτον Κρόνος ὤν. εἴπερ γʼ αὐτὸν σωθῆναι χρὴ καὶ μὴ λαλιὰν μόνον ἀσκῆσαι. δεῦρʼ ἴθι, τοῦτον δʼ ἔα μαίνεσθαι. κλαύσει, τὴν χεῖρʼ ἢν ἐπιβάλλῃς. παύσασθε μάχης καὶ λοιδορίας. ἀλλʼ ἐπίδειξαι σύ τε τοὺς προτέρους ἅττʼ ἐδίδασκες, σύ τε τὴν καινὴν παίδευσιν, ὅπως ἂν ἀκούσας σφῷν ἀντιλεγόντοιν κρίνας φοιτᾷ. δρᾶν ταῦτʼ ἐθέλω. κἄγωγʼ ἐθέλω. φέρε δὴ πότερος λέξει πρότερος; τούτῳ δώσω· κᾆτʼ ἐκ τούτων ὧν ἂν λέξῃ ῥηματίοισιν καινοῖς αὐτὸν καὶ διανοίαις κατατοξεύσω. τὸ τελευταῖον δʼ, ἢν ἀναγρύζῃ, τὸ πρόσωπον ἅπαν καὶ τὠφθαλμὼ κεντούμενος ὥσπερ ὑπʼ ἀνθρηνῶν ὑπὸ τῶν γνωμῶν ἀπολεῖται.
Now the two, relying on very dexterous arguments and thoughts, and sententious maxims, will show which of them shall appear superior in argument. For now the whole crisis of wisdom is here laid before them; about which my friends have a very great contest.	νῦν δείξετον τὼ πισύνω τοῖς περιδεξίοισι λόγοισι καὶ φροντίσι καὶ γνωμοτύποις μερίμναις, ὁπότερος αὐτοῖν λέγων ἀμείνων φανήσεται. νῦν γὰρ ἅπας ἐνθάδε κίνδυνος ἀνεῖται σοφίας, ἧς πέρι τοῖς ἐμοῖς φίλοις ἐστὶν ἀγὼν μέγιστος.
But do you, who adorned our elders with many virtuous manners, utter the voice in which you rejoice, and declare your nature.	ἀλλʼ ὦ πολλοῖς τοὺς πρεσβυτέρους ἤθεσι χρηστοῖς στεφανώσας, ῥῆξον φωνὴν ᾗτινι χαίρεις, καὶ τὴν σαυτοῦ φύσιν εἰπέ.
I will, therefore, describe the ancient system of education, how it was ordered, when I flourished in the advocacy of justice, and temperance was the fashion. In the first place it was incumbent that no one should hear the voice of a boy uttering a syllable; and next, that those from the same quarter of the town should march in good order through the streets to the school of the harp-master, naked, and in a body, even if it were to snow as thick as meal. Then again, their master would teach them, not sitting cross-legged, to learn by rote a song, either pallada persepolin deinan or teleporon ti boama raising to a higher pitch the harmony which our fathers transmitted to us. But if any of them were to play the buffoon, or to turn any quavers, like these difficult turns the present artists make after the manner of Phrynis, he used to be thrashed, being beaten with many blows, as banishing the Muses. And it behooved the boys, while sitting in the school of the Gymnastic-master, to cover the thigh, so that they might exhibit nothing indecent to those outside; then again, after rising from the ground, to sweep the sand together, and to take care not to leave an impression of the person for their lovers. And no boy used in those days to anoint himself below the navel; so that their bodies wore the appearance of blooming health. Nor used he to go to his lover, having made up his voice in an effeminate tone, prostituting himself with his eyes. Nor used it to be allowed when one was dining to take the head of the radish, or to snatch from their seniors dill or parsley, or to eat fish, or to giggle, or to keep the legs crossed.	λέξω τοίνυν τὴν ἀρχαίαν παιδείαν ὡς διέκειτο, ὅτʼ ἐγὼ τὰ δίκαια λέγων ἤνθουν καὶ σωφροσύνη ʼνενόμιστο. πρῶτον μὲν ἔδει παιδὸς φωνὴν γρύξαντος μηδὲν ἀκοῦσαι· εἶτα βαδίζειν ἐν ταῖσιν ὁδοῖς εὐτάκτως ἐς κιθαριστοῦ τοὺς κωμήτας γυμνοὺς ἁθρόους, κεἰ κριμνώδη κατανείφοι. εἶτʼ αὖ προμαθεῖν ᾆσμʼ ἐδίδασκεν τὼ μηρὼ μὴ ξυνέχοντας, ἢ Παλλάδα περσέπολιν δεινὰν ἢ τηλέπορόν τι βόαμα, ἐντειναμένους τὴν ἁρμονίαν, ἣν οἱ πατέρες παρέδωκαν. εἰ δέ τις αὐτῶν βωμολοχεύσαιτʼ ἢ κάμψειέν τινα καμπήν, οἵας οἱ νῦν τὰς κατὰ Φρῦνιν ταύτας τὰς δυσκολοκάμπτους, ἐπετρίβετο τυπτόμενος πολλὰς ὡς τὰς Μούσας ἀφανίζων. ἐν παιδοτρίβου δὲ καθίζοντας τὸν μηρὸν ἔδει προβαλέσθαι τοὺς παῖδας, ὅπως τοῖς ἔξωθεν μηδὲν δείξειαν ἀπηνές· εἶτʼ αὖ πάλιν αὖθις ἀνιστάμενον συμψῆσαι, καὶ προνοεῖσθαι εἴδωλον τοῖσιν ἐρασταῖσιν τῆς ἥβης μὴ καταλείπειν. ἠλείψατο δʼ ἂν τοὐμφαλοῦ οὐδεὶς παῖς ὑπένερθεν τότʼ ἄν, ὥστε τοῖς αἰδοίοισι δρόσος καὶ χνοῦς ὥσπερ μήλοισιν ἐπήνθει· οὐδʼ ἂν μαλακὴν φυρασάμενος τὴν φωνὴν πρὸς τὸν ἐραστὴν αὐτὸς ἑαυτὸν προαγωγεύων τοῖς ὀφθαλμοῖς ἐβάδιζεν, οὐδʼ ἀνελέσθαι δειπνοῦντʼ ἐξῆν καὶ κεφάλαιον ῥαφανῖδος, οὐδʼ ἄννηθον τῶν πρεσβυτέρων ἁρπάζειν οὐδὲ σέλινον, οὐδʼ ὀψοφαγεῖν οὐδὲ κιχλίζειν οὐδʼ ἴσχειν τὼ πόδʼ ἐναλλάξ. ἀρχαῖά γε καὶ Διιπολιώδη καὶ τεττίγων ἀνάμεστα καὶ Κηκείδου καὶ Βουφονίων. ἀλλʼ οὖν ταῦτʼ ἐστὶν ἐκεῖνα,
Aye, antiquated and dipolia-like and full of grasshoppers, and of Cecydes, and of the Buphonian festival! Yet certainly these are those principles by which my system of education nurtured the men who fought at Marathon. But you teach the men of the present day, so that I am choked, when at the Panathenaia a fellow, holding his shield before his person, neglects Tritogenia, when they ought to dance. Wherefore, O youth, choose with confidence, me, the better cause, and you will learn to hate the Agora, and to refrain from baths, and to be ashamed of what is disgraceful, and to be enraged if any one jeer you, and to rise up from seats before your seniors when they approach, and not to behave ill toward your parents, and to do nothing else that is base, because you are to form in your mind an image of Modesty: and not to dart into the house of a dancing-woman, lest, while gaping after these things, being struck with an apple by a wanton, you should be damaged in your reputation: and not to contradict your father in anything; nor by calling him Iapetus, to reproach him with the ills of age, by which you were reared in your infancy.	ἐξ ὧν ἄνδρας Μαραθωνομάχας ἡμὴ παίδευσις ἔθρεψεν. σὺ δὲ τοὺς νῦν εὐθὺς ἐν ἱματίοισι διδάσκεις ἐντετυλίχθαι· ὥστε μʼ ἀπάγχεσθʼ, ὅταν ὀρχεῖσθαι Παναθηναίοις δέον αὐτοὺς τὴν ἀσπίδα τῆς κωλῆς προέχων ἀμελῇ τῆς Τριτογενείας. πρὸς ταῦτʼ ὦ μειράκιον θαρρῶν ἐμὲ τὸν κρείττω λόγον αἱροῦ· κἀπιστήσει μισεῖν ἀγορὰν καὶ βαλανείων ἀπέχεσθαι, καὶ τοῖς αἰσχροῖς αἰσχύνεσθαι, κἂν σκώπτῃ τίς σε φλέγεσθαι· καὶ τῶν θάκων τοῖς πρεσβυτέροις ὑπανίστασθαι προσιοῦσιν, καὶ μὴ περὶ τοὺς σαυτοῦ γονέας σκαιουργεῖν, ἄλλο τε μηδὲν αἰσχρὸν ποιεῖν, ὅτι τῆς αἰδοῦς μέλλεις τἄγαλμʼ ἀναπλάττειν· μηδʼ εἰς ὀρχηστρίδος εἰσᾴττειν, ἵνα μὴ πρὸς ταῦτα κεχηνὼς μήλῳ βληθεὶς ὑπὸ πορνιδίου τῆς εὐκλείας ἀποθραυσθῇς· μηδʼ ἀντειπεῖν τῷ πατρὶ μηδέν, μηδʼ Ἰαπετὸν καλέσαντα μνησικακῆσαι τὴν ἡλικίαν ἐξ ἧς ἐνεοττοτροφήθης.
If you shall believe him in this, O youth, by Bacchus, you will be like the sons of Hippocrates, and they will call you a booby. Yet certainly shall you spend your time in the gymnastic schools, sleek and blooming; not chattering in the market-place rude jests, like the youths of the present day; nor dragged into court for a petty suit, greedy, pettifogging, knavish; but you shall descend to the Academy and run races beneath the sacred olives along with some modest compeer, crowned with white reeds, redolent of yew, and careless ease, of leaf-shedding white poplar, rejoicing in the season of spring, when the plane-tree whispers to the elm.	εἰ ταῦτʼ ὦ μειράκιον πείσει τούτῳ, νὴ τὸν Διόνυσον τοῖς Ἱπποκράτους υἱέσιν εἴξεις καὶ σε καλοῦσι βλιτομάμμαν. ἀλλʼ οὖν λιπαρός γε καὶ εὐανθὴς ἐν γυμνασίοις διατρίψεις, οὐ στωμύλλων κατὰ τὴν ἀγορὰν τριβολεκτράπελʼ οἷάπερ οἱ νῦν, οὐδʼ ἑλκόμενος περὶ πραγματίου γλισχραντιλογεξεπιτρίπτου· ἀλλʼ εἰς Ἀκαδήμειαν κατιὼν ὑπὸ ταῖς μορίαις ἀποθρέξει στεφανωσάμενος καλάμῳ λευκῷ μετὰ σώφρονος ἡλικιώτου, μίλακος ὄζων καὶ ἀπραγμοσύνης καὶ λεύκης φυλλοβολούσης, ἦρος ἐν ὥρᾳ χαίρων, ὁπόταν πλάτανος πτελέᾳ ψιθυρίζῃ.
If you do these things which I say, and apply your mind to these, you will ever have a stout chest, a clear complexion, broad shoulders, a little tongue, large hips, little lewdness. But if you practise what the youths of the present day do, you will have in the first place, a pallid complexion, small shoulders, a narrow chest, a large tongue, little hips, great lewdness, a long psephism; and this deceiver will persuade you to consider everything that is base to be honourable, and what is honourable to be base; and in addition to this, he will fill you with the lewdness of Antimachus.	ἢν ταῦτα ποιῇς ἁγὼ φράζω, καὶ πρὸς τούτοις προσέχῃς τὸν νοῦν, ἕξεις ἀεὶ στῆθος λιπαρόν, χροιὰν λαμπράν, ὤμους μεγάλους, γλῶτταν βαιάν, πυγὴν μεγάλην, πόσθην μικράν. ἢν δʼ ἅπερ οἱ νῦν ἐπιτηδεύῃς, πρῶτα μὲν ἕξεις χροιὰν ὠχράν, ὤμους μικρούς, στῆθος λεπτόν, γλῶτταν μεγάλην, πυγὴν μικράν, κωλῆν μεγάλην, ψήφισμα μακρόν, καὶ σʼ ἀναπείσει τὸ μὲν αἰσχρὸν ἅπαν καλὸν ἡγεῖσθαι, τὸ καλὸν δʼ αἰσχρόν· καὶ πρὸς τούτοις τῆς Ἀντιμάχου καταπυγοσύνης ἀναπλήσει.
O thou that practisest most renowned high-towering wisdom! How sweetly does a modest grace attend your words! Happy, therefore, were they who lived in those days, in the times of former men! In reply, then, to these, O thou that hast a dainty-seeming Muse, it behooveth thee to say something new; since the man has gained renown.	ὦ καλλίπυργον σοφίαν κλεινοτάτην ἐπασκῶν, ὡς ἡδύ σου τοῖσι λόγοις σῶφρον ἔπεστιν ἄνθος. †εὐδαίμονες δʼ ἦσαν ἄρʼ οἱ ζῶντες τότʼ ἐπὶ τῶν προτέρων†· πρὸς τάδε σʼ ὦ κομψοπρεπῆ μοῦσαν ἔχων, δεῖ σε λέγειν τι καινόν, ὡς ηὐδοκίμηκεν ἁνήρ.
And it appears you have need of powerful arguments against him, if you are to conquer the man and not incur laughter.	δεινῶν δέ σοι βουλευμάτων ἔοικε δεῖν πρὸς αὐτόν, εἴπερ τὸν ἄνδρʼ ὑπερβαλεῖ καὶ μὴ γέλωτʼ ὀφλήσεις.
And yet I was choking in my heart, and was longing to confound all these with contrary maxims. For I have been called among the deep thinkers the worse cause on this very account, that I first contrived how to speak against both law and justice; and this art is worth more than ten thousand staters, that one should choose the worse cause, and nevertheless be victorious. But mark how I will confute the system of education on which he relies, who says, in the first place, that he will not permit you to be washed with warm water. And yet, on what principle do you blame the warm baths? Because it is most vile, and makes a man cowardly. Stop! For immediately I seize and hold you by the waist without escape. Come, tell me, which of the sons of Jupiter do you deem to have been the bravest in soul, and to have undergone most labours? I consider no man superior to Hercules. Where, pray, did you ever see cold Herculean baths? And yet, who was more valiant than he? These are the very things which make the bath full of youths always chattering all day long, but the palaestras empty. You next find fault with their living in the market-place; but I commend it. For if it had been bad, Homer would never have been for representing Nestor as an orator; nor all the other wise men. I will return, then, from thence to the tongue, which this fellow says our youths ought not to exercise, while I maintain they should. And again, he says they ought to be modest: two very great evils. For tell me to whom you have ever seen any good accrue through modesty and confute me by your words. To many. Peleus, at any rate, received his sword on account of it. A sword? Marry, he got a pretty piece of luck, the poor wretch! While Hyperbolus, he of the lamps, got more than many talents by his villainy, but by Jupiter, no sword!	καὶ μὴν πάλαι γʼ ἐπνιγόμην τὰ σπλάγχνα κἀπεθύμουν ἅπαντα ταῦτʼ ἐναντίαις γνώμαισι συνταράξαι. ἐγὼ γὰρ ἥττων μὲν λόγος διʼ αὐτὸ τοῦτʼ ἐκλήθην ἐν τοῖσι φροντισταῖσιν, ὅτι πρώτιστος ἐπενόησα τοῖσιν νόμοις καὶ ταῖς δίκαις τἀναντίʼ ἀντιλέξαι. καὶ τοῦτο πλεῖν ἢ μυρίων ἔστʼ ἄξιον στατήρων, αἱρούμενον τοὺς ἥττονας λόγους ἔπειτα νικᾶν. σκέψαι δὲ τὴν παίδευσιν ᾗ πέποιθεν ὡς ἐλέγξω, ὅστις σε θερμῷ φησι λοῦσθαι πρῶτον οὐκ ἐάσειν. καίτοι τίνα γνώμην ἔχων ψέγεις τὰ θερμὰ λουτρά; ὁτιὴ κάκιστόν ἐστι καὶ δειλὸν ποιεῖ τὸν ἄνδρα. ἐπίσχες· εὐθὺς γάρ σʼ ἔχω μέσον λαβὼν ἄφυκτον. καί μοι φράσον, τῶν τοῦ Διὸς παίδων τίνʼ ἄνδρʼ ἄριστον ψυχὴν νομίζεις, εἰπέ, καὶ πλείστους πόνους πονῆσαι. ἐγὼ μὲν οὐδένʼ Ἡρακλέους βελτίονʼ ἄνδρα κρίνω. ποῦ ψυχρὰ δῆτα πώποτʼ εἶδες Ἡράκλεια λουτρά; καίτοι τίς ἀνδρειότερος ἦν; ταῦτʼ ἐστὶ ταῦτʼ ἐκεῖνα, ἃ τῶν νεανίσκων ἀεὶ διʼ ἡμέρας λαλούντων πλῆρες τὸ βαλανεῖον ποιεῖ, κενὰς δὲ τὰς παλαίστρας. εἶτʼ ἐν ἀγορᾷ τὴν διατριβὴν ψέγεις· ἐγὼ δʼ ἐπαινῶ. εἰ γὰρ πονηρὸν ἦν, Ὅμηρος οὐδέποτʼ ἂν ἐποίει τὸν Νέστορʼ ἀγορητὴν ἂν οὐδὲ τοὺς σοφοὺς ἅπαντας. ἄνειμι δῆτʼ ἐντεῦθεν ἐς τὴν γλῶτταν, ἣν ὁδὶ μὲν οὔ φησι χρῆναι τοὺς νέους ἀσκεῖν, ἐγὼ δέ φημι. καὶ σωφρονεῖν αὖ φησι χρῆναι· δύο κακὼ μεγίστω. ἐπεὶ σὺ διὰ τὸ σωφρονεῖν τῷ πώποτʼ εἶδες ἤδη ἀγαθάν τι γενόμενον, φράσον, καί μʼ ἐξέλεγξον εἰπών. πολλοῖς. ὁ γοῦν Πηλεὺς ἔλαβε διὰ τοῦτο τὴν μάχαιραν. μάχαιραν; ἀστεῖόν γε κέρδος ἔλαβεν ὁ κακοδαίμων. Ὑπέρβολος δʼ οὑκ τῶν λύχνων πλεῖν ἢ τάλαντα πολλὰ εἴληφε διὰ πονηρίαν, ἀλλʼ οὐ μὰ Δίʼ οὐ μάχαιραν.
And Peleus married Thetis, too, through his modesty. And then she went off and left him; for he was not lustful, nor an agreeable bedfellow to spend the night with. Now a woman delights in being wantonly treated. But you are an old dotard. For consider, O youth, all that attaches to modesty, and of how many pleasures you are about to be deprived--of women, of games at cottabus, of dainties, of drinking-bouts, of giggling. And yet, what is life worth to you if you be deprived of these enjoyments? Well, I will pass from thence to the necessities of our nature. You have gone astray, you have fallen in love, you have been guilty of some adultery, and then have been caught. You are undone, for you are unable to speak. But if you associate with me, indulge your inclination, dance, laugh, and think nothing disgraceful. For if you should happen to be detected as an adulterer, you will make this reply to him, that you have done him no injury : and then refer him to Jupiter, how even he is overcome by love and women . And yet, how could you, who are a mortal, have greater power than a god? But what if he should suffer the radish through obeying you, and be depillated with hot ashes? What argument will he be able to state, to prove that he is not a blackguard? And if he be a blackguard, what harm will he suffer?	καὶ τὴν Θέτιν γʼ ἔγημε διὰ τὸ σωφρονεῖν ὁ Πηλεύς. κᾆτʼ ἀπολιποῦσά γʼ αὐτὸν ᾤχετʼ· οὐ γὰρ ἦν ὑβριστὴς οὐδʼ ἡδὺς ἐν τοῖς στρώμασιν τὴν νύκτα παννυχίζειν· γυνὴ δὲ σιναμωρουμένη χαίρει· σὺ δʼ εἶ Κρόνιππος. σκέψαι γὰρ ὦ μειράκιον ἐν τῷ σωφρονεῖν ἅπαντα ἅνεστιν, ἡδονῶν θʼ ὅσων μέλλεις ἀποστερεῖσθαι, παίδων γυναικῶν κοττάβων ὄψων πότων κιχλισμῶν. καίτοι τί σοι ζῆν ἄξιον, τούτων ἐὰν στερηθῇς; εἶεν. πάρειμʼ ἐντεῦθεν ἐς τὰς τῆς φύσεως ἀνάγκας. ἥμαρτες, ἠράσθης, ἐμοίχευσάς τι, κᾆτʼ ἐλήφθης· ἀπόλωλας· ἀδύνατος γὰρ εἶ λέγειν. ἐμοὶ δʼ ὁμιλῶν χρῶ τῇ φύσει, σκίρτα, γέλα, νόμιζε μηδὲν αἰσχρόν. μοιχὸς γὰρ ἢν τύχῃς ἁλούς, τάδʼ ἀντερεῖς πρὸς αὐτόν, ὡς οὐδὲν ἠδίκηκας· εἶτʼ ἐς τὸν Δίʼ ἐπανενεγκεῖν, κἀκεῖνος ὡς ἥττων ἔρωτός ἐστι καὶ γυναικῶν· καίτοι σὺ θνητὸς ὢν θεοῦ πῶς μεῖζον ἂν δύναιο; τί δʼ ἢν ῥαφανιδωθῇ πιθόμενός σοι τέφρᾳ τε τιλθῇ, ἕξει τινὰ γνώμην λέγειν τὸ μὴ εὐρύπρωκτος εἶναι; ἢν δʼ εὐρύπρωκτος ᾖ, τί πείσεται κακόν;
Nay, what could he ever suffer still greater than this? What then will you say if you be conquered by me in this? I will be silent: what else can I do? Come, now, tell me; from what class do the advocates come? From the blackguards. I believe you. What then? From what class do tragedians come? From the blackguards. You say well. But from what class do the public orators come? From the blackguards. Then have you perceived that you say nothing to the purpose? And look which class among the audience is the more numerous. Well now, I'm looking. What, then, do you see? By the gods, the blackguards to be far more numerous. This fellow, at any rate, I know; and him yonder; and this fellow with the long hair. What, then, will you say? We are conquered. Ye blackguards, by the gods, receive my cloak, for I desert to you.	τί μὲν οὖν ἂν ἔτι μεῖζον πάθοι τούτου ποτέ; τί δῆτʼ ἐρεῖς, ἢν τοῦτο νικηθῇς ἐμοῦ; σιγήσομαι. τί δʼ ἄλλο; φέρε δή μοι φράσον· συνηγοροῦσιν ἐκ τίνων; ἐξ εὐρυπρώκτων. πείθομαι. τί δαί; τραγῳδοῦσʼ ἐκ τίνων; ἐξ εὐρυπρώκτων. εὖ λέγεις. δημηγοροῦσι δʼ ἐκ τίνων; ἐξ εὐρυπρώκτων. ἆρα δῆτʼ ἔγνωκας ὡς οὐδὲν λέγεις; καὶ τῶν θεατῶν ὁπότεροι πλείους σκόπει. καὶ δὴ σκοπῶ. τί δῆθʼ ὁρᾷς; πολὺ πλείονας νὴ τοὺς θεοὺς τοὺς εὐρυπρώκτους· τουτονὶ γοῦν οἶδʼ ἐγὼ κἀκεινονὶ καὶ τὸν κομήτην τουτονί. τί δῆτʼ ἐρεῖς; ἡττήμεθʼ· ὦ κινούμενοι πρὸς τῶν θεῶν δέξασθέ μου θοἰμάτιον, ὡς ἐξαυτομολῶ πρὸς ὑμᾶς.
What then? whether do you wish to take and lead away this your son, or shall I teach him to speak? Teach him, and chastise him: and remember that you train him properly; on the one side able for petty suits; but train his other jaw able for the more important causes. Make yourself easy; you shall receive him back a clever sophist. Nay, rather, pale and wretched.	τί δῆτα; πότερα τοῦτον ἀπάγεσθαι λαβὼν βούλει τὸν υἱόν, ἢ διδάσκω σοι λέγειν; δίδασκε καὶ κόλαζε καὶ μέμνησʼ ὅπως εὖ μοι στομώσεις αὐτόν, ἐπὶ μὲν θάτερα οἷον δικιδίοις, τὴν δʼ ἑτέραν αὐτοῦ γνάθον στόμωσον οἵαν ἐς τὰ μείζω πράγματα. ἀμέλει κομιεῖ τοῦτον σοφιστὴν δεξιόν. ὠχρὸν μὲν οὖν οἶμαί γε καὶ κακοδαίμονα.
Go ye, then: but I think that you will repent of these proceedings.	χωρεῖτέ νυν. οἶμαι δέ σοι ταῦτα μεταμελήσειν.
We wish to speak about the judges, what they will gain, if at all they justly assist this Chorus. For in the first place, if you wish to plough up your fields in spring, we will rain for you first; but for the others afterward. And then we will protect the fruits, and the vines, so that neither drought afflict them, nor excessive wet weather. But if any mortal dishonour us who are goddesses, let him consider what evils he will suffer at our hands, obtaining neither wine nor anything else from his farm. For when his olives and vines sprout, they shall be cut down; with such slings will we smite them. And if we see him making brick, we will rain; and we will smash the tiles of his roof with round hailstones. And if he himself, or any one of his kindred or friends, at any time marry, we will rain the whole night; so he will probably wish rather to have been even in Egypt than to have judged badly.	τοὺς κριτὰς ἃ κερδανοῦσιν, ἤν τι τόνδε τὸν χορὸν ὠφελῶσʼ ἐκ τῶν δικαίων, βουλόμεσθʼ ἡμεῖς φράσαι. πρῶτα μὲν γάρ, ἢν νεᾶν βούλησθʼ ἐν ὥρᾳ τοὺς ἀγρούς, ὕσομεν πρώτοισιν ὑμῖν, τοῖσι δʼ ἄλλοις ὕστερον. εἶτα τὸν καρπὸν τεκούσας ἀμπέλους φυλάξομεν, ὥστε μήτʼ αὐχμὸν πιέζειν μήτʼ ἄγαν ἐπομβρίαν. ἢν δʼ ἀτιμάσῃ τις ἡμᾶς θνητὸς ὢν οὔσας θεάς, προσεχέτω τὸν νοῦν, πρὸς ἡμῶν οἷα πείσεται κακά, λαμβάνων οὔτʼ οἶνον οὔτʼ ἄλλʼ οὐδὲν ἐκ τοῦ χωρίου. ἡνίκʼ ἂν γὰρ αἵ τʼ ἐλαῖαι βλαστάνωσʼ αἵ τʼ ἄμπελοι, ἀποκεκόψονται· τοιαύταις σφενδόναις παιήσομεν. ἢν δὲ πλινθεύοντʼ ἴδωμεν, ὕσομεν καὶ τοῦ τέγους τὸν κέραμον αὐτοῦ χαλάζαις στρογγύλαις συντρίψομεν. κἂν γαμῇ ποτʼ αὐτὸς ἢ τῶν ξυγγενῶν ἢ τῶν φίλων, ὕσομεν τὴν νύκτα πᾶσαν· ὥστʼ ἴσως βουλήσεται κἂν ἐν Αἰγύπτῳ τυχεῖν ὢν μᾶλλον ἢ κρῖναι κακῶς.
The fifth, the fourth, the third, after this the second; and then, of all the days I most fear, and dread, and abominate, immediately after this there is the Old and New. For every one to whom I happen to be indebted, swears, and says he will ruin and destroy me, having made his deposits against me; though I only ask what is moderate and just- My good sir, one part don't take just now; the other part put off I pray; and the other part remit ; they say that thus they will never get back their money, but abuse me, as I am unjust, and say they will go to law with me. Now therefore let them go to law, for it little concerns me, if Phidippides has learned to speak well. I shall soon know by knocking at the thinking-shop. Boy, I say! Boy, boy! Good morning, Strepsiades. The same to you. But first accept this present; for one ought to compliment the teacher with a fee. And tell me about my son, if he has learned that cause, which you just now brought forward. He has learned it. Well done, O Fraud, all-powerful queen! So that you can get clear off from whatever suit you please. Even if witnesses were present when I borrowed the money? Yea, much more! Even if a thousand be present.	πέμπτη, τετράς, τρίτη, μετὰ ταύτην δευτέρα, εἶθʼ ἣν ἐγὼ μάλιστα πασῶν ἡμερῶν δέδοικα καὶ πέφρικα καὶ βδελύττομαι, εὐθὺς μετὰ ταύτην ἔσθʼ ἕνη τε καὶ νέα. πᾶς γάρ τις ὀμνὺς οἷς ὀφείλων τυγχάνω, θείς μοι πρυτανεῖʼ ἀπολεῖν μέ φησι κἀξολεῖν, κἀμοῦ μέτριά τε καὶ δίκαιʼ αἰτουμένου, ὦ δαιμόνιε τὸ μέν τι νυνὶ μὴ λάβῃς, τὸ δʼ ἀναβαλοῦ μοι, τὸ δʼ ἄφες , οὔ φασίν ποτε οὕτως ἀπολήψεσθʼ, ἀλλὰ λοιδοροῦσί με ὡς ἄδικός εἰμι, καὶ δικάσεσθαί φασί μοι. νῦν οὖν δικαζέσθων· ὀλίγον γάρ μοι μέλει, εἴπερ μεμάθηκεν εὖ λέγειν Φειδιππίδης. τάχα δʼ εἴσομαι κόψας τὸ φροντιστήριον. παῖ, ἠμί, παῖ παῖ.

Then I will shout with a very loud shout: Ho! Weep, you petty-usurers, both you and your principals, and your compound interests! For you can no longer do me any harm, because such a son is being reared for me in this house, shining with a double-edged tongue, for my guardian, the preserver of my house, a mischief to my enemies, ending the sadness of the great woes of his father. Him do thou run and summon from within to me. O child! O son! Come forth from the house! Hear your father! Lo, here is the man! O my dear, my dear! Take your son and depart.	βοάσομαί τἄρα τὰν ὑπέρτονον βοάν. ἰὼ κλάετʼ ὦ ʼβολοστάται αὐτοί τε καὶ τἀρχαῖα καὶ τόκοι τόκων· οὐδὲν γὰρ ἄν με φλαῦρον ἐργάσαισθʼ ἔτι, οἷος ἐμοὶ τρέφεται τοῖσδʼ ἐνὶ δώμασι παῖς, ἀμφήκει γλώττῃ λάμπων, πρόβολος ἐμός, σωτὴρ δόμοις, ἐχθροῖς βλάβη, λυσανίας πατρῴων μεγάλων κακῶν· ὃν κάλεσον τρέχων ἔνδοθεν ὡς ἐμέ. ὦ τέκνον ὦ παῖ ἔξελθʼ οἴκων, ἄιε σοῦ πατρός. ὅδʼ ἐκεῖνος ἀνήρ. ὦ φίλος ὦ φίλος. ἄπιθι συλλαβών.
Oh, oh, my child! Huzza! Huzza! How I am delighted at the first sight of your complexion! Now, indeed, you are, in the first place, negative and disputatious to look at, and this fashion native to the place plainly appears, the what do you say? and the seeming to be injured when, I well know, you are injuring and inflicting a wrong; and in your countenance there is the Attic look. Now, therefore, see that you save me, since you have also ruined me. What, pray, do you fear? The Old and New. Why, is any day old and new? Yes; on which they say that they will make their deposits against me. Then those that have made them will lose them; for it is not possible that two days can be one day. Can not it? Certainly not; unless the same woman can be both old and young at the same time. And yet it is the law. For they do not, I think, rightly understand what the law means. And what does it mean? The ancient Solon was by nature the commons' friend. This surely is nothing whatever to the Old and New. He therefore made the summons for two days, for the Old and New, that the deposits might be made on the first of the month. Why, pray, did he add the old day? In order, my good sir, that the defendants, being present a day before, might compromise the matter of their own accord; but if not, that they might be worried on the morning of the new moon. Why, then, do the magistrates not receive the deposits on the new moon, but on the Old and New? They seem to me to do what the forestallers do: in order that they may appreciate the deposits as soon as possible, on this account they have the first pick by one day. Bravo! Ye wretches, why do you sit senseless, the gain of us wise men, being blocks, ciphers, mere sheep, jars heaped together, wherefore I must sing an encomium upon myself and this my son, on account of our good fortune.	ἰὼ ἰὼ τέκνον, ἰὼ ἰοῦ ἰοῦ. ὡς ἥδομαί σου πρῶτα τὴν χρόαν ἰδών. νῦν μέν γʼ ἰδεῖν εἶ πρῶτον ἐξαρνητικὸς κἀντιλογικός, καὶ τοῦτο τοὐπιχώριον ἀτεχνῶς ἐπανθεῖ, τὸ τί λέγεις σύ; καὶ δοκεῖν ἀδικοῦντʼ ἀδικεῖσθαι καὶ κακουργοῦντʼ οἶδʼ ὅτι· ἐπὶ τοῦ προσώπου τʼ ἐστὶν Ἀττικὸν βλέπος. νῦν οὖν ὅπως σώσεις μʼ, ἐπεὶ κἀπώλεσας. φοβεῖ δὲ δὴ τί; τὴν ἕνην τε καὶ νέαν. ἕνη γάρ ἐστι καὶ νέα τις ἡμέρα; εἰς ἥν γε θήσειν τὰ πρυτανεῖά φασί μοι. ἀπολοῦσʼ ἄρʼ αὔθʼ οἱ θέντες· οὐ γὰρ ἔσθʼ ὅπως μίʼ ἡμέρα γένοιτʼ ἂν ἡμέρα δύο. οὐκ ἂν γένοιτο; πῶς γάρ; εἰ μή πέρ γʼ ἅμα αὑτὴ γένοιτʼ ἂν γραῦς τε καὶ νέα γυνή. καὶ μὴν νενόμισταί γʼ. οὐ γάρ, οἶμαι, τὸν νόμον ἴσασιν ὀρθῶς ὅ τι νοεῖ. νοεῖ δὲ τί; ὁ Σόλων ὁ παλαιὸς ἦν φιλόδημος τὴν φύσιν. τουτὶ μὲν οὐδέν πω πρὸς ἕνην τε καὶ νέαν. ἐκεῖνος οὖν τὴν κλῆσιν ἐς δύʼ ἡμέρας ἔθηκεν, ἔς γε τὴν ἕνην τε καὶ νέαν, ἵνʼ αἱ θέσεις γίγνοιντο τῇ νουμηνίᾳ. ἵνα δὴ τί τὴν ἕνην προσέθηχʼ; ἵνʼ ὦ μέλε παρόντες οἱ φεύγοντες ἡμέρᾳ μιᾷ πρότερον ἀπαλλάττοινθʼ ἑκόντες, εἰ δὲ μή, ἕωθεν ὑπανιῷντο τῇ νουμηνία. πῶς οὐ δέχονται δῆτα τῇ νουμηνίᾳ ἁρχαὶ τὰ πρυτανεῖʼ, ἀλλʼ ἕνῃ τε καὶ νέᾳ; ὅπερ οἱ προτένθαι γὰρ δοκοῦσί μοι ποιεῖν· ὅπως τάχιστα τὰ πρυτανεῖʼ ὑφελοίατο, διὰ τοῦτο προὐτένθευσαν ἡμέρᾳ μιᾷ. εὖ γʼ· ὦ κακοδαίμονες, τί κάθησθʼ ἀβέλτεροι, ἡμέτερα κέρδη τῶν σοφῶν ὄντες, λίθοι, ἀριθμός, πρόβατʼ ἄλλως, ἀμφορῆς νενησμένοι; ὥστʼ εἰς ἐμαυτὸν καὶ τὸν υἱὸν τουτονὶ ἐπʼ εὐτυχίαισιν ᾀστέον μοὐγκώμιον.
"O happy Strepsiades! How wise you are yourself, and how excellent is the son whom you are rearing!"" My friends and fellow-tribesmen will say of me, envying me, when you prove victorious in arguing causes. But first I wish to lead you in and entertain you."	μάκαρ ὦ Στρεψίαδες, αὐτός τʼ ἔφυς ὡς σοφὸς χοἶον τὸν υἱὸν τρέφεις , φήσουσι δή μʼ οἱ φίλοι χοἰ δημόται ζηλοῦντες ἡνίκʼ ἂν σὺ νικᾷς λέγων τὰς δίκας.
Then, ought a man to throw away any part of his own property? Never! But it were better then at once to put away blushes, rather than now to have trouble; since I am now dragging you to be a witness, for the sake of my own money; and further, in addition to this, I shall become an enemy to my fellow-tribesman. But never, while I live, will I disgrace my country, but will summon Strepsiades. Who's there? For the Old and New. I call you to witness, that he has named it for two days. For what matter do you summon me? For the twelve minae, which you received when you were buying the dapple-gray horse. A horse? Do you not hear? I, whom you all know to hate horsemanship! And, by Jupiter! You swore by the gods too, that you would repay it. Ay, by Jove! For then my Phidippides did not yet know the irrefragable argument. And do you now intend, on this account, to deny the debt? Why, what good should I get else from his instruction? And will you be willing to deny these upon oath of the gods? What gods? Jupiter, Mercury, and Neptune. Yes, by Jupiter! And would pay down, too, a three-obol piece besides to swear. Then may you perish some day for your impudence! This man would be the better for it if he were cleansed by rubbing with salt. Ah me, how you deride me! He will contain six choae. By great Jupiter and the gods, you certainly shall not do this to me with impunity! I like your gods amazingly; and Jupiter, sworn by, is ridiculous to the knowing ones. You will assuredly suffer punishment, some time or other, for this. But answer and dismiss me, whether you are going to repay me my money or not. Keep quiet now, for I will presently answer you distinctly. (to his summons-witness). What do you think he will do? I think he will pay you. Where is this man who asks me for his money? Tell me what is this? What is this? A kardopos. And do you then ask me for your money, being such an ignorant person? I would not pay, not even an obolus, to any one who called the kardope kardopos. Then won't you pay me? Not, as far as I know. Will you not then pack off as fast as possible from my door? I will depart; and be assured of this, that I will make deposit against you, or may I live no longer! Then you will lose it besides, in addition to your twelve minae. And yet I do not wish you to suffer this, because you named the kardopos floolishly.	ἀλλʼ εἰσάγων σε βούλομαι πρῶτον ἑστιᾶσαι. εἶτʼ ἄνδρα τῶν αὑτοῦ τι χρὴ προϊέναι; οὐδέποτέ γʼ, ἀλλὰ κρεῖττον εὐθὺς ἦν τότε ἀπερυθριᾶσαι μᾶλλον ἢ σχεῖν πράγματα, ὅτε τῶν ἐμαυτοῦ γʼ ἕνεκα νυνὶ χρημάτων ἕλκω σε κλητεύσοντα, καὶ γενήσομαι ἐχθρὸς ἔτι πρὸς τούτοισιν ἀνδρὶ δημότῃ. ἀτὰρ οὐδέποτέ γε τὴν πατρίδα καταισχυνῶ ζῶν, ἀλλὰ καλοῦμαι Στρεψιάδην — τίς οὑτοσί; ἐς τὴν ἕνην τε καὶ νέαν. μαρτύρομαι, ὅτι ἐς δύʼ εἶπεν ἡμέρας. τοῦ χρήματος; τῶν δώδεκα μνῶν, ἃς ἔλαβες ὠνούμενος τὸν ψαρὸν ἵππον. ἵππον; οὐκ ἀκούετε; ὃν πάντες ὑμεῖς ἴστε μισοῦνθʼ ἱππικήν. καὶ νὴ Δίʼ ἀποδώσειν γʼ ἐπώμνυς τοὺς θεούς. μὰ τὸν Δίʼ οὐ γάρ πω τότʼ ἐξηπίστατο Φειδιππίδης μοι τὸν ἀκατάβλητον λόγον. νῦν δὲ διὰ τοῦτʼ ἔξαρνος εἶναι διανοεῖ; τί γὰρ ἄλλʼ ἂν ἀπολαύσαιμι τοῦ μαθήματος; καὶ ταῦτʼ ἐθελήσεις ἀπομόσαι μοι τοὺς θεοὺς ἵνʼ ἂν κελεύσω ʼγώ σε; τοὺς ποίους θεούς; τὸν Δία, τὸν Ἑρμῆν, τὸν Ποσειδῶ. νὴ Δία κἂν προσκαταθείην γʼ ὥστʼ ὀμόσαι τριώβολον. ἀπόλοιο τοίνυν ἕνεκʼ ἀναιδείας ἔτι. ἁλσὶν διασμηχθεὶς ὄναιτʼ ἂν οὑτοσί. οἴμʼ ὡς καταγελᾷς. ἓξ χοᾶς χωρήσεται. οὔ τοι μὰ τὸν Δία τὸν μέγαν καὶ τοὺς θεοὺς ἐμοῦ καταπροίξει. θαυμασίως ἥσθην θεοῖς, καὶ Ζεὺς γέλοιος ὀμνύμενος τοῖς εἰδόσιν. ἦ μὴν σὺ τούτων τῷ χρόνῳ δώσεις δίκην. ἀλλʼ εἴτʼ ἀποδώσεις μοι τὰ χρήματʼ εἴτε μή, ἀπόπεμψον ἀποκρινάμενος. ἔχε νυν ἥσυχος. ἐγὼ γὰρ αὐτίκʼ ἀποκρινοῦμαί σοι σαφῶς. τί σοι δοκεῖ δράσειν; ἀποδώσειν μοι δοκεῖ. ποῦ ʼσθʼ οὗτος ἁπαιτῶν με τἀργύριον; λέγε τουτὶ τί ἔστι; τοῦθʼ ὅ τι ἐστί; κάρδοπος. ἔπειτʼ ἀπαιτεῖς τἀργύριον τοιοῦτος ὤν; οὐκ ἂν ἀποδοίην οὐδʼ ἂν ὀβολὸν οὐδενί, ὅστις καλέσειε κάρδοπον τὴν καρδόπην. οὐκ ἄρʼ ἀποδώσεις; οὐχ ὅσον γέ μʼ εἰδέναι. οὔκουν ἀνύσας τι θᾶττον ἀπολιταργιεῖς ἀπὸ τῆς θύρας; ἄπειμι, καὶ τοῦτʼ ἴσθʼ ὅτι θήσω πρυτανεῖʼ ἢ μηκέτι ζῴην ἐγώ. καὶ προσαπολεῖς ἄρʼ αὐτὰ πρὸς ταῖς δώδεκα. καίτοι σε τοῦτό γʼ οὐχὶ βούλομαι παθεῖν, ὁτιὴ ʼκάλεσας εὐηθικῶς τὴν κάρδοπον.
Ah me! Ah me! Ha! Whoever is this, who is lamenting? Surely it was not one of Carcinus' deities that spoke. But why do you wish to know this, who I am?-A miserable man. Then follow your own path. O harsh fortune! O Fates, breaking the wheels of my horses! O Pallas, how you have destroyed me! What evil, pray, has Tlepolemus ever done you? Do not jeer me, my friend; but order your son to pay me the money which he received; especially as I have been unfortunate. What money is this? That which he borrowed. Then you were really unlucky, as I think. By the gods, I fell while driving my horses. Why, pray, do you talk nonsense, as if you had fallen from an ass? Do I talk nonsense if I wish to recover my money? You can't be in your senses yourself. Why, pray? You appear to me to have had your brains shaken as it were. And you appear to me, by Hermes, to be going to be summoned, if you will not pay me the money? Tell me now, whether you think that Jupiter always rains fresh rain on each occasion, or that the sun draws from below the same water back again? I know not which; nor do I care. How then is it just that you should recover your money, if you know nothing of meteorological matters? Well, if you are in want, pay me the interest of my money. What sort of animal is this interest? Most assuredly the money is always becoming more and more every month and every day as the time slips away. You say well. What then? Is it possible that you consider the sea to be greater now than formerly? No, by Jupiter, but equal; for it is not fitting that it should be greater. And how then, you wretch does this become no way greater, though the rivers flow into it, while you seek to increase your money? Will you not take yourself off from my house? Bring me the goad. I call you to witness these things. Go! Why do you delay? Won't you march, Mr. Blood-horse? Is not this an insult, pray? Will you move quickly? I'll lay on you, goading you behind, you outrigger? Do you fly? I thought I should stir you, together with your wheels and your two-horse chariots.	ἰώ μοί μοι. ἔα. τίς οὑτοσί ποτʼ ἔσθʼ ὁ θρηνῶν; οὔτι που τῶν Καρκίνου τις δαιμόνων ἐφθέγξατο; τί δʼ ὅστις εἰμὶ τοῦτο βούλεσθʼ εἰδέναι; ἀνὴρ κακοδαίμων. κατὰ σεαυτόν νυν τρέπου. ὦ σκληρὲ δαῖμον, ὦ τύχαι θραυσάντυγες ἵππων ἐμῶν, ὦ Παλλὰς ὥς μʼ ἀπώλεσας. τί δαί σε Τληπόλεμός ποτʼ εἴργασται κακόν; μὴ σκῶπτέ μʼ ὦ τᾶν, ἀλλά μοι τὰ χρήματα τὸν υἱὸν ἀποδοῦναι κέλευσον ἅλαβεν, ἄλλως τε μέντοι καὶ κακῶς πεπραγότι. τὰ ποῖα ταῦτα χρήμαθʼ; ἁδανείσατο. κακῶς ἄρʼ ὄντως εἶχες, ὥς γʼ ἐμοὶ δοκεῖς. ἵππους ἐλαύνων ἐξέπεσον νὴ τοὺς θεούς. τί δῆτα ληρεῖς ὥσπερ ἀπʼ ὄνου καταπεσών; ληρῶ, τὰ χρήματʼ ἀπολαβεῖν εἰ βούλομαι; οὐκ ἔσθʼ ὅπως σύ γʼ αὐτὸς ὑγιαίνεις. τί δαί; τὸν ἐγκέφαλον ὥσπερ σεσεῖσθαί μοι δοκεῖς. σὺ δὲ νὴ τὸν Ἑρμῆν προσκεκλήσεσθαί γέ μοι, εἰ μὴ ʼποδώσεις τἀργύριον. κάτειπέ νυν, πότερα νομίζεις καινὸν ἀεὶ τὸν Δία ὕειν ὕδωρ ἑκάστοτʼ, ἢ τὸν ἥλιον ἕλκειν κάτωθεν ταὐτὸ τοῦθʼ ὕδωρ πάλιν; οὐκ οἶδʼ ἔγωγʼ ὁπότερον, οὐδέ μοι μέλει. πῶς οὖν ἀπολαβεῖν τἀργύριον δίκαιος εἶ, εἰ μηδὲν οἶσθα τῶν μετεώρων πραγμάτων; ἀλλʼ εἰ σπανίζεις, τἀργυρίου μοι τὸν τόκον ἀπόδοτε· τοῦτο δʼ ἔσθʼ ὁ τόκος τί θηρίον; τί δʼ ἄλλο γʼ ἢ κατὰ μῆνα καὶ καθʼ ἡμέραν πλέον πλέον τἀργύριον ἀεὶ γίγνεται ὑπορρέοντος τοῦ χρόνου; καλῶς λέγεις. τί δῆτα; τὴν θάλατταν ἔσθʼ ὅτι πλείονα νυνὶ νομίζεις ἢ πρὸ τοῦ; μὰ Δίʼ ἀλλʼ ἴσην. οὐ γὰρ δίκαιον πλείονʼ εἶναι. κᾆτα πῶς αὕτη μὲν ὦ κακόδαιμον οὐδὲν γίγνεται ἐπιρρεόντων τῶν ποταμῶν πλείων, σὺ δὲ ζητεῖς ποιῆσαι τἀργύριον πλεῖον τὸ σόν; οὐκ ἀποδιώξει σαυτὸν ἀπὸ τῆς οἰκίας; φέρε μοι τὸ κέντρον. ταῦτʼ ἐγὼ μαρτύρομαι. ὕπαγε. τί μέλλεις; οὐκ ἐλᾷς ὦ σαμφόρα; ταῦτʼ οὐχ ὕβρις δῆτʼ ἐστίν; ᾄξεις; ἐπιαλῶ κεντῶν ὑπὸ τὸν πρωκτόν σε τὸν σειραφόρον. φεύγεις; ἔμελλόν σʼ ἆρα κινήσειν ἐγὼ αὐτοῖς τροχοῖς τοῖς σοῖσι καὶ ξυνωρίσιν.
What a thing it is to love evil courses! For this old man, having loved them, wishes to withhold the money that he borrowed. And he will certainly meet with something today, which will perhaps cause this sophist to suddenly receive some misfortune, in return for the knaveries he has begun.	οἷον τὸ πραγμάτων ἐρᾶν φλαύρων· ὁ γὰρ γέρων ὅδʼ ἐρασθεὶς ἀποστερῆσαι βούλεται τὰ χρήμαθʼ ἁδανείσατο· κοὐκ ἔσθʼ ὅπως οὐ τήμερον λήψεταί τι πρᾶγμʼ, ὃ τοῦτον ποιήσει τὸν σοφιστὴν ἀνθʼ ὧν πανουργεῖν ἤρξατʼ, ἐξαίφνης λαβεῖν κακόν τι.
For I think that he will presently find what has been long boiling up, that his son is skilful to speak opinions opposed to justice, so as to overcome all with whomsoever he holds converse, even if he advance most villainous doctrines; and perhaps, perhaps his father will wish that he were even speechless.	οἶμαι γὰρ αὐτὸν αὐτίχʼ εὑρήσειν ὅπερ πάλαι ποτʼ †ἐπεζήτει† εἶναι τὸν υἱὸν δεινόν οἱ γνώμας ἐναντίας λέγειν τοῖσιν δικαίοις, ὥστε νικᾶν ἅπαντας οἷσπερ ἂν ξυγγένηται, κἂν λέγῃ παμπόνηρʼ. ἴσως δʼ ἴσως βουλήσεται κἄφωνον αὐτὸν εἶναι.
(running out of the house pursued by his son) Hollo! Hollo! O neighbours, and kinsfolk, and fellow-tribesmen, defend me, by all means, who am being beaten! Ah me, unhappy man, for my head and jaw! Wretch! Do you beat your father? Yes, father. You see him owning that he beats me. Certainly. O wretch, and parricide, and house-breaker! Say the same things of me again, and more. Do you know that I take pleasure in being much abused? You blackguard! Sprinkle me with roses in abundance. Do you beat your father? And will prove too, by Jupiter! that I beat you with justice. O thou most rascally! Why, how can it be just to beat a father? I will demonstrate it, and will overcome you in argument. Will you overcome me in this? Yea, by much and easily. But choose which of the two Causes you wish to speak. Of what two Causes? The better, or the worse? Marry, I did get you taught to speak against justice, by Jupiter, my friend, if you are going to persuade me of this, that it is just and honourable for a father to be beaten by his sons! I think I shall certainly persuade you; so that, when you have heard, not even you yourself will say anything against it. Well, now, I am willing to hear what you have to say.	ἰοὺ ἰού. ὦ γείτονες καὶ ξυγγενεῖς καὶ δημόται, ἀμυνάθετέ μοι τυπτομένῳ πάσῃ τέχνῃ. οἴμοι κακοδαίμων τῆς κεφαλῆς καὶ τῆς γνάθου. ὦ μιαρὲ τύπτεις τὸν πατέρα; φήμʼ ὦ πάτερ. ὁρᾶθʼ ὁμολογοῦνθʼ ὅτι με τύπτει. καὶ μάλα. ὦ μιαρὲ καὶ πατραλοῖα καὶ τοιχωρύχε. αὖθίς με ταὐτὰ ταῦτα καὶ πλείω λέγε. ἆρʼ οἶσθʼ ὅτι χαίρω πόλλʼ ἀκούων καὶ κακά; ὦ λακκόπρωκτε. πάττε πολλοῖς τοῖς ῥόδοις. τὸν πατέρα τύπτεις; κἀποφανῶ γε νὴ Δία ὡς ἐν δίκῃ σʼ ἔτυπτον. ὦ μιαρώτατε, καὶ πῶς γένοιτʼ ἂν πατέρα τύπτειν ἐν δίκῃ; ἔγωγʼ ἀποδείξω καί σε νικήσω λέγων. τουτὶ σὺ νικήσεις; πολύ γε καὶ ῥᾳδίως. ἑλοῦ δʼ ὁπότερον τοῖν λόγοιν βούλει λέγειν. ποίοιν λόγοιν; τὸν κρείττονʼ ἢ τὸν ἥττονα. ἐδιδαξάμην μέντοι σε νὴ Δίʼ ὦ μέλε τοῖσιν δικαίοις ἀντιλέγειν, εἰ ταῦτά γε μέλλεις ἀναπείσειν, ὡς δίκαιον καὶ καλὸν τὸν πατέρα τύπτεσθʼ ἐστὶν ὑπὸ τῶν υἱέων. ἀλλʼ οἴομαι μέντοι σʼ ἀναπείσειν, ὥστε γε οὐδʼ αὐτὸς ἀκροασάμενος οὐδὲν ἀντερεῖς. καὶ μὴν ὅ τι καὶ λέξεις ἀκοῦσαι βούλομαι.
It is your business, old man, to consider in what way you shall conquer the man; for if he were not relying upon something, he would not be so licentious. But he is emboldened by something; the boldness of the man is evident.	σὸν ἔργον ὦ πρεσβῦτα φροντίζειν ὅπῃ τὸν ἄνδρα κρατήσεις, ὡς οὗτος, εἰ μή τῳ ʼπεποίθειν, οὐκ ἂν ἦν οὕτως ἀκόλαστος. ἀλλʼ ἔσθʼ ὅτῳ θρασύνεται· δῆλόν γε τἀνθρώπου ʼσʼτὶ τὸ λῆμα.
Now you ought to tell to the Chorus from what the contention first arose. And this you must do by all means.	ἀλλʼ ἐξ ὅτου τὸ πρῶτον ἤρξαθʼ ἡ μάχη γενέσθαι, ἤδη λέγειν χρὴ πρὸς χορόν· πάντως δὲ τοῦτο δράσεις.
Well, now, I will tell you from what we first began to rail at one another. After we had feasted, as you know, I first bade him take a lyre, and sing a song of Simonides, The Shearing of the Ram. But he immediately said it was old-fashioned to play on the lyre and sing while drinking, like a woman grinding parched barley. For ought you not then immediately to be beaten and trampled on, bidding me sing, just as if you were entertaining cicadae? He expressed, however, such opinions then too within, as he does now; and he asserted that Simonides was a bad poet. I bore it at first, with difficulty indeed, yet nevertheless I bore it. And then I bade him at least take a myrtle-wreath and recite to me some portion of Aeschylus; and then he immediately said, Shall I consider Aeschylus the first among the poets, full of empty sound, unpolished, bombastic, using rugged words? And hereupon you can't think how my heart panted. But, nevertheless, I restrained my passion, and said, At least recite some passage of the more modern poets, of whatever kind these clever things be. And he immediately sang a passage of Euripides, how a brother, O averter of ill! Debauched his uterine sister. And I bore it no longer, but immediately assailed him with many abusive reproaches. And then, after that, as was natural, we hurled word upon word. Then he springs upon me; and then he was wounding me, and beating me, and throttling me. Were you not therefore justly beaten, who do not praise Euripides, the wisest of poets? He the wisest! Oh, what shall I call you? But I shall be beaten again. Yes, by Jupiter, with justice. Why, how with justice? Who, O shameless fellow, reared you, understanding all your wishes, when you lisped what you meant? If you said bryn, I, understanding it, used to give you to drink. And when you asked for mamman, I used to come to you with bread. And you used no sooner to say caccan, than I used to take and carry you out of doors, and hold you before me.	καὶ μὴν ὅθεν γε πρῶτον ἠρξάμεσθα λοιδορεῖσθαι ἐγὼ φράσω· ʼπειδὴ γὰρ εἱστιώμεθʼ, ὥσπερ ἴστε, πρῶτον μὲν αὐτὸν τὴν λύραν λαβόντʼ ἐγὼ ʼκέλευσα ᾆσαι Σιμωνίδου μέλος, τὸν Κριὸν ὡς ἐπέχθη. ὁ δʼ εὐθέως ἀρχαῖον εἶνʼ ἔφασκε τὸ κιθαρίζειν ᾄδειν τε πίνονθʼ ὡσπερεὶ κάχρυς γυναῖκʼ ἀλοῦσαν. οὐ γὰρ τότʼ εὐθὺς χρῆν σʼ ἄρα τύπτεσθαί τε καὶ πατεῖσθαι, ᾄδειν κελεύονθʼ ὡσπερεὶ τέττιγας ἑστιῶντα; τοιαῦτα μέντοι καὶ τότʼ ἔλεγεν ἔνδον οἷάπερ νῦν, καὶ τὸν Σιμωνίδην ἔφασκʼ εἶναι κακὸν ποιητήν. κἀγὼ μόλις μὲν ἀλλʼ ὅμως ἠνεσχόμην τὸ πρῶτον· ἔπειτα δʼ ἐκέλευσʼ αὐτὸν ἀλλὰ μυρρίνην λαβόντα τῶν Αἰσχύλου λέξαι τί μοι· κᾆθʼ οὗτος εὐθὺς εἶπεν· ἐγὼ γὰρ Αἰσχύλον νομίζω πρῶτον ἐν ποιηταῖς, ψόφου πλέων ἀξύστατον στόμφακα κρημνοποιόν; κἀνταῦθα πῶς οἴεσθέ μου τὴν καρδίαν ὀρεχθεῖν; ὅμως δὲ τὸν θυμὸν δακὼν ἔφην, σὺ δʼ ἀλλὰ τούτων λέξον τι τῶν νεωτέρων, ἅττʼ ἐστὶ τὰ σοφὰ ταῦτα. ὁ δʼ εὐθὺς ᾖσʼ Εὐριπίδου ῥῆσίν τινʼ, ὡς ἐκίνει ἀδελφὸς ὦλεξίκακε τὴν ὁμομητρίαν ἀδελφήν. κἀγὼ οὐκέτʼ ἐξηνεσχόμην, ἀλλʼ εὐθέως ἀράττω πολλοῖς κακοῖς καἰσχροῖσι· κᾆτʼ ἐντεῦθεν, οἷον εἰκός, ἔπος πρὸς ἔπος ἠρειδόμεσθʼ· εἶθʼ οὗτος ἐπαναπηδᾶ, κἄπειτʼ ἔφλα με κἀσπόδει κἄπνιγε κἀπέθλιβεν. οὔκουν δικαίως, ὅστις οὐκ Εὐριπίδην ἐπαινεῖς σοφώτατον; σοφώτατόν γʼ ἐκεῖνον·ὦ — τί σʼ εἴπω; ἀλλʼ αὖθις αὖ τυπτήσομαι. νὴ τὸν Δίʼ ἐν δίκῃ γʼ ἄν. καὶ πῶς δικαίως; ὅστις ὦ ʼναίσχυντέ σʼ ἐξέθρεψα, αἰσθανόμενός σου πάντα τραυλίζοντος, ὅ τι νοοίης. εἰ μέν γε βρῦν εἴποις, ἐγὼ γνοὺς ἂν πιεῖν ἐπέσχον· μαμμᾶν δʼ ἂν αἰτήσαντος ἧκόν σοι φέρων ἂν ἄρτον· κακκᾶν δʼ ἂν οὐκ ἔφθης φράσας, κἀγὼ λαβὼν θύραζε ἐξέφερον ἂν καὶ προὐσχόμην σε· σὺ δʼ ἐμὲ νῦν ἀπάγχων
But you now, throttling me who was bawling and crying out because I wanted to ease myself, had not the heart to carry me forth out of doors, you wretch; but I did it there while I was being throttled.	βοῶντα καὶ κεκραγόθʼ ὅτι χεζητιῴην, οὐκ ἔτλης ἔξω ʼξενεγκεῖν ὦ μιαρὲ θύραζέ μʼ, ἀλλὰ πνιγόμενος αὐτοῦ ʼποίησα κακκᾶν.
I fancy the hearts of the youths are panting to hear what he will say. For if, after having done such things, he shall persuade him by speaking, I would not take the hide of the old folks, even at the price of a chick-pea.	οἶμαί γε τῶν νεωτέρων τὰς καρδίας πηδᾶν ὅ τι λέξει. εἰ γὰρ τοιαῦτά γʼ οὗτος ἐξειργασμένος λαλῶν ἀναπείσει, τὸ δέρμα τῶν γεραιτέρων λάβοιμεν ἂν ἀλλʼ οὐδʼ ἐρεβίνθου.
It is thy business, thou author and upheaver of new words, to seek some means of persuasion, so that you shall seem to speak justly.	σὸν ἔργον ὦ καινῶν ἐπῶν κινητὰ καὶ μοχλευτὰ πειθώ τινα ζητεῖν, ὅπως δόξεις λέγειν δίκαια.
How pleasant it is to be acquainted with new and clever things, and to be able to despise the established laws! For I, when I applied my mind to horsemanship alone, used not to be able to utter three words before I made a mistake; but now, since he himself has made me cease from these pursuits, and I am acquainted with subtle thoughts, and arguments, and speculations, I think I shall demonstrate that it is just to chastise one's father. Ride, then, by Jupiter! Since it is better for me to keep a team of four horses than to be killed with a beating. I will pass over to that part of my discourse where you interrupted me; and first I will ask you this: Did you beat me when I was a boy? I did, through good-will and concern for you. Pray tell me, is it not just that I also should be well inclined toward you in the same way, and beat you, since this is to be well inclined-to give a beating? For why ought your body to be exempt from blows and mine not? And yet I too was born free. The boys weep, and do you not think it is right that a father should weep? You will say that it is ordained by law that this should be the lot of boys. But I would reply, that old men are boys twice over, and that it is the more reasonable that the old should weep than the young, inasmuch as it is less just that they should err. It is nowhere ordained by law that a father should suffer this. Was it not then a man like you and me, who first proposed this law, and by speaking persuaded the ancients? Why then is it less lawful for me also in turn to propose henceforth a new law for the sons, that they should beat their fathers in turn? But as many blows as we received before the law was made, we remit: and we concede to them our having been thrashed without return. Observe the cocks and these other animals, how they punish their fathers; and yet, in what do they differ from us, except that they do not write decrees? Why then, since you imitate the cocks in all things, do you not both eat dung and sleep on a perch? It is not the same thing, my friend; nor would it appear so to Socrates. Therefore do not beat me; otherwise you will one day blame yourself. Why, how? Since I am justly entitled to chastise you; and you to chastise your son, if you should have one. But if I should not have one, I shall have wept for nothing, and you will die laughing at me.	ὡς ἡδὺ καινοῖς πράγμασιν καὶ δεξιοῖς ὁμιλεῖν, καὶ τῶν καθεστώτων νόμων ὑπερφρονεῖν δύνασθαι. ἐγὼ γὰρ ὅτε μὲν ἱππικῇ τὸν νοῦν μόνῃ προσεῖχον, οὐδʼ ἂν τρίʼ εἰπεῖν ῥήμαθʼ οἷός τʼ ἦν πρὶν ἐξαμαρτεῖν· νυνὶ δʼ ἐπειδή μʼ οὑτοσὶ τούτων ἔπαυσεν αὐτός, γνώμαις δὲ λεπταῖς καὶ λόγοις ξύνειμι καὶ μερίμναις, οἶμαι διδάξειν ὡς δίκαιον τὸν πατέρα κολάζειν. ἵππευε τοίνυν νὴ Δίʼ, ὡς ἔμοιγε κρεῖττόν ἐστιν ἵππων τρέφειν τέθριππον ἢ τυπτόμενον ἐπιτριβῆναι. ἐκεῖσε δʼ ὅθεν ἀπέσχισάς με τοῦ λόγου μέτειμι, καὶ πρῶτʼ ἐρήσομαί σε τουτί· παῖδά μʼ ὄντʼ ἔτυπτες; ἔγωγέ σʼ εὐνοῶν τε καὶ κηδόμενος. εἰπὲ δή μοι, οὐ κἀμέ σοι δίκαιόν ἐστιν εὐνοεῖν ὁμοίως τύπτειν τʼ, ἐπειδήπερ γε τοῦτʼ ἐστʼ εὐνοεῖν τὸ τύπτειν; πῶς γὰρ τὸ μὲν σὸν σῶμα χρὴ πληγῶν ἀθῷον εἶναι, τοὐμὸν δὲ μή; καὶ μὴν ἔφυν ἐλεύθερός γε κἀγώ. κλάουσι παῖδες, πατέρα δʼ οὐ κλάειν δοκεῖς; φήσεις νομίζεσθαι σὺ παιδὸς τοῦτο τοὔργον εἶναι· ἐγὼ δέ γʼ ἀντείποιμʼ ἂν ὡς δὶς παῖδες οἱ γέροντες· εἰκὸς δὲ μᾶλλον τοὺς γέροντας ἢ νέους τι κλάειν, ὅσῳπερ ἐξαμαρτάνειν ἧττον δίκαιον αὐτούς. ἀλλʼ οὐδαμοῦ νομίζεται τὸν πατέρα τοῦτο πάσχειν. οὔκουν ἀνὴρ ὁ τὸν νόμον θεὶς τοῦτον ἦν τὸ πρῶτον ὥσπερ σὺ κἀγώ, καὶ λέγων ἔπειθε τοὺς παλαιούς; ἧττόν τι δῆτʼ ἔξεστι κἀμοὶ καινὸν αὖ τὸ λοιπὸν θεῖναι νόμον τοῖς υἱέσιν, τοὺς πατέρας ἀντιτύπτειν; ὅσας δὲ πληγὰς εἴχομεν πρὶν τὸν νόμον τεθῆναι, ἀφίεμεν, καὶ δίδομεν αὐτοῖς προῖκα συγκεκόφθαι. σκέψαι δὲ τοὺς ἀλεκτρυόνας καὶ τἄλλα τὰ βοτὰ ταυτί, ὡς τοὺς πατέρας ἀμύνεται· καίτοι τί διαφέρουσιν ἡμῶν ἐκεῖνοι, πλήν γʼ ὅτι ψηφίσματʼ οὐ γράφουσιν; τί δῆτʼ, ἐπειδὴ τοὺς ἀλεκτρυόνας ἅπαντα μιμεῖ, οὐκ ἐσθίεις καὶ τὴν κόπρον κἀπὶ ξύλου καθεύδεις; οὐ ταὐτὸν ὦ τᾶν ἐστίν, οὐδʼ ἂν Σωκράτει δοκοίη. πρὸς ταῦτα μὴ τύπτʼ· εἰ δὲ μή, σαυτόν ποτʼ αἰτιάσει. καὶ πῶς; ἐπεὶ σὲ μὲν δίκαιός εἰμʼ ἐγὼ κολάζειν, σὺ δʼ, ἢν γένηταί σοι, τὸν υἱόν. ἢν δὲ μὴ γένηται, μάτην ἐμοὶ κεκλαύσεται, σὺ δʼ ἐγχανὼν τεθνήξεις.
To me, indeed, O comrades, he seems to speak justly; and I think we ought to concede to them what is fitting. For it is proper that we should weep, if we do not act justly. Consider still another maxim. No; for I shall perish if I do. And yet perhaps you will not be vexed at suffering what you now suffer. How, pray? For inform me what good you will do me by this. I will beat my mother, just as I have you. What do you say? What do you say? This other, again, is a greater wickedness.	ἐμοὶ μὲν ὦνδρες ἥλικες δοκεῖ λέγειν δίκαια· κἄμοιγε συγχωρεῖν δοκεῖ τούτοισι τἀπιεικῆ. κλάειν γὰρ ἡμᾶς εἰκός ἐστʼ, ἢν μὴ δίκαια δρῶμεν. σκέψαι δὲ χἀτέραν ἔτι γνώμην. ἀπὸ γὰρ καὶ μὴν ἴσως γʼ οὐκ ἀχθέσει παθὼν ἃ νῦν πέπονθας. πῶς δή; δίδαξον γὰρ τί μʼ ἐκ τούτων ἐπωφελήσεις. τὴν μητέρʼ ὥσπερ καὶ σὲ τυπτήσω. τί φῄς, τί φῂς σύ; τοῦθʼ ἕτερον αὖ μεῖζον κακόν. τί δʼ ἢν ἔχων τὸν ἥττω
But what if, having the worst Cause, I shall conquer you in arguing, proving that it is right to beat one's mother? Most assuredly, if you do this, nothing will hinder you from casting yourself and your Worse Cause into the pit along with Socrates. These evils have I suffered through you, O Clouds! Having intrusted all my affairs to you.	λόγον σε νικήσω λέγων τὴν μητέρʼ ὡς τύπτειν χρεών; τί δʼ ἄλλο γʼ ἢν ταυτὶ ποιῇς, οὐδέν σε κωλύσει σεαυτὸν ἐμβαλεῖν ἐς τὸ βάραθρον μετὰ Σωκράτους καὶ τὸν λόγον τὸν ἥττω.
Nay, rather, you are yourself the cause of these things, having turned yourself to wicked courses. Why, pray, did you not tell me this, then, but excited with hopes a rustic and aged man? We always do this to him whom we perceive to be a lover of wicked courses, until we precipitate him into misfortune, so that he may learn to fear the gods. Ah me ! it is severe, O Clouds! But it is just; for I ought not to have withheld the money which I borrowed. Now, therefore, come with me, my dearest son, that you may destroy the blackguard Chaerephon and Socrates, who deceived you and me. I will not injure my teachers. Yes, yes, reverence Paternal Jove. Paternal Jove quoth'a! How antiquated you are! Why, is there any Jove? There is. There is not, no; for Vortex reigns having expelled Jupiter. He has not expelled him; but I fancied this, on account of this Vortex here. Ah me, unhappy man! When I even took you who are of earthenware for a god. Here rave and babble to yourself.	ταυτὶ διʼ ὑμᾶς ὦ Νεθέλαι πέπονθʼ ἐγώ, ὑμῖν ἀναθεὶς ἅπαντα τἀμὰ πράγματα. αὐτὸς μὲν οὖν σαυτῷ σὺ τούτων αἴτιος, στρέψας σεαυτὸν ἐς πονηρὰ πράγματα. τί δῆτα ταῦτʼ οὔ μοι τότʼ ἠγορεύετε, ἀλλʼ ἄνδρʼ ἄγροικον καὶ γέροντʼ ἐπῄρετε; ἡμεῖς ποιοῦμεν ταῦθʼ ἑκάστοθʼ ὅταν τινὰ γνῶμεν πονηρῶν ὄντʼ ἐραστὴν πραγμάτων, ἕως ἂν αὐτὸν ἐμβάλωμεν ἐς κακόν, ὅπως ἂν εἰδῇ τοὺς θεοὺς δεδοικέναι. ὤμοι πονηρά γʼ ὦ Νεφέλαι, δίκαια δέ. οὐ γάρ μʼ ἐχρῆν τὰ χρήμαθʼ ἁδανεισάμην ἀποστερεῖν. νῦν οὖν ὅπως ὦ φίλτατε τὸν Χαιρεφῶντα τὸν μιαρὸν καὶ Σωκράτη ἀπολεῖς μετʼ ἐμοῦ ʼλθών, οἳ σὲ κἄμʼ ἐξηπάτων. ἀλλʼ οὐκ ἂν ἀδικήσαιμι τοὺς διδασκάλους. ναὶ ναὶ καταιδέσθητι πατρῷον Δία. ἰδού γε Δία πατρῷον· ὡς ἀρχαῖος εἶ. Ζεὺς γάρ τις ἔστιν; ἔστιν. οὐκ ἔστʼ, οὔκ, ἐπεὶ Δῖνος βασιλεύει τὸν Δίʼ ἐξεληλακώς. οὐκ ἐξελήλακʼ, ἀλλʼ ἐγὼ τοῦτʼ ᾠόμην διὰ τουτονὶ τὸν δῖνον. οἴμοι δείλαιος ὅτε καὶ σὲ χυτρεοῦν ὄντα θεὸν ἡγησάμην. ἐνταῦθα σαυτῷ παραφρόνει καὶ φληνάφα.
Ah me, what madness! How mad, then, I was when I ejected the gods on account of Socrates! But O dear Hermes, by no means be wroth with me, nor destroy me; but pardon me, since I have gone crazy through prating. And become my adviser, whether I shall bring an action and prosecute them, or whatever you think. You advise me rightly, not permitting me to get up a lawsuit, but as soon as possible to set fire to the house of the prating fellows. Come hither, come hither, Xanthias! Come forth with a ladder and with a mattock and then mount upon the thinking-shop and dig down the roof, if you love your master, until you tumble the house upon them. But let some one bring me a lighted torch and I'll make some of them this day suffer punishment, even if they be ever so much impostors. (from within) Hollo! Hollo! It is your business, O torch, to send forth abundant flame. What are you doing, fellow? What am I doing? Why, what else, than chopping logic with the beams of your house? (from within) You will destroy us! You will destroy us! For I also wish this very thing; unless my mattock deceive my hopes, or I should somehow fall first and break my neck. (from within). Hollo you! What are you doing, pray, you fellow on the roof? I am walking on air, and speculating about the sun. Ah me, unhappy! I shall be suffocated, wretched man! And I, miserable man, shall be burnt to death! For what has come into your heads that you acted insolently toward the gods, and pried into the seat of the moon? Chase, pelt, smite them, for many reasons, but especially because you know that they offended against the gods! Lead the way out; for we have sufficiently acted as chorus for today.	οἴμοι παρανοίας· ὡς ἐμαινόμην ἄρα, ὅτʼ ἐξέβαλλον τοὺς θεοὺς διὰ Σωκράτη. ἀλλʼ ὦ φίλʼ Ἑρμῆ μηδαμῶς θύμαινέ μοι μηδέ μʼ ἐπιτρίψῃς, ἀλλὰ συγγνώμην ἔχε ἐμοῦ παρανοήσαντος ἀδολεσχίᾳ· καί μοι γενοῦ ξύμβουλος, εἴτʼ αὐτοὺς γραφὴν διωκάθω γραψάμενος εἴθʼ ὅ τι σοι δοκεῖ. ὀρθῶς παραινεῖς οὐκ ἐῶν δικορραφεῖν, ἀλλʼ ὡς τάχιστʼ ἐμπιμπράναι τὴν οἰκίαν τῶν ἀδολεσχῶν. δεῦρο δεῦρʼ ὦ Ξανθία, κλίμακα λαβὼν ἔξελθε καὶ σμινύην φέρων, κἄπειτʼ ἐπαναβὰς ἐπὶ τὸ φροντιστήριον τὸ τέγος κατάσκαπτʼ, εἰ φιλεῖς τὸν δεσπότην, ἕως ἂν αὐτοῖς ἐμβάλῃς τὴν οἰκίαν· ἐμοὶ δὲ δᾷδʼ ἐνεγκάτω τις ἡμμένην, κἀγώ τινʼ αὐτῶν τήμερον δοῦναι δίκην ἐμοὶ ποιήσω, κεἰ σφόδρʼ εἴσʼ ἀλαζόνες. ἰοὺ ἰού. σὸν ἔργον ὦ δᾲς ἱέναι πολλὴν φλόγα. ἄνθρωπε, τί ποιεῖς; ὅ τι ποιῶ; τί δʼ ἄλλο γʼ ἢ διαλεπτολογοῦμαι ταῖς δοκοῖς τῆς οἰκίας; οἴμοι τίς ἡμῶν πυρπολεῖ τὴν οἰκίαν; ἐκεῖνος οὗπερ θοἰμάτιον εἰλήφατε. ἀπολεῖς ἀπολεῖς. τοῦτʼ αὐτὸ γὰρ καὶ βούλομαι, ἢν ἡ σμινύη μοι μὴ προδῷ τὰς ἐλπίδας, ἢ ʼγὼ πρότερόν πως ἐκτραχηλισθῶ πεσών. οὗτος τί ποιεῖς ἐτεὸν οὑπὶ τοῦ τέγους; ἀεροβατῶ καὶ περιφρονῶ τὸν ἥλιον. οἴμοι τάλας δείλαιος ἀποπνιγήσομαι. ἐγὼ δὲ κακοδαίμων γε κατακαυθήσομαι. τί γὰρ μαθόντες τοὺς θεοὺς ὑβρίζετε, καὶ τῆς σελήνης ἐσκοπεῖσθε τὴν ἕδραν; δίωκε βάλλε παῖε, πολλῶν οὕνεκα, μάλιστα δʼ εἰδὼς τοὺς θεοὺς ὡς ἠδίκουν. ἡγεῖσθʼ ἔξω· κεχόρευται γὰρ μετρίως τό γε τήμερον ἡμῖν.
To earth’s remotest limit we come, to the Scythian land, an untrodden solitude. And now, Hephaestus, yours is the charge to observe the mandates laid upon you by the Father—to clamp this miscreant	Χθονὸς μὲν ἐς τηλουρὸν ἥκομεν πέδον, Σκύθην ἐς οἷμον, ἄβατον εἰς ἐρημίαν. Ἥφαιστε, σοὶ δὲ χρὴ μέλειν ἐπιστολὰς ἅς σοι πατὴρ ἐφεῖτο, τόνδε πρὸς πέτραις
upon the high craggy rocks in shackles of binding adamant that cannot be broken. For your own flower, flashing fire, source of all arts, he has purloined and bestowed upon mortal creatures. Such is his offence; for this he is bound to make requital to the gods,	ὑψηλοκρήμνοις τὸν λεωργὸν ὀχμάσαι ἀδαμαντίνων δεσμῶν ἐν ἀρρήκτοις πέδαις. τὸ σὸν γὰρ ἄνθος, παντέχνου πυρὸς σέλας, θνητοῖσι κλέψας ὤπασεν. τοιᾶσδέ τοι ἁμαρτίας σφε δεῖ θεοῖς δοῦναι δίκην,
so that he may learn to bear with the sovereignty of Zeus and cease his man-loving ways.	ὡς ἂν διδαχθῇ τὴν Διὸς τυραννίδα στέργειν, φιλανθρώπου δὲ παύεσθαι τρόπου.
Power and Force, for you indeed the behest of Zeus is now fulfilled, and nothing remains to stop you. But for me—I do not have the nerve myself	Κράτος Βία τε, σφῷν μὲν ἐντολὴ Διὸς ἔχει τέλος δὴ κοὐδὲν ἐμποδὼν ἔτι· ἐγὼ δʼ ἄτολμός εἰμι συγγενῆ θεὸν
to bind with force a kindred god upon this rocky cleft assailed by cruel winter. Yet, come what may, I am constrained to summon courage to this deed; for it is perilous to disregard the commandments of the Father. Lofty-minded son of Themis who counsels straight, against my will, no less than yours, I must rivet you with brazen bonds	δῆσαι βίᾳ φάραγγι πρὸς δυσχειμέρῳ. πάντως δʼ ἀνάγκη τῶνδέ μοι τόλμαν σχεθεῖν· ἐξωριάζειν γὰρ πατρὸς λόγους βαρύ. τῆς ὀρθοβούλου Θέμιδος αἰπυμῆτα παῖ, ἄκοντά σʼ ἄκων δυσλύτοις χαλκεύμασι
no hand can loose to this desolate crag, where neither voice nor form of mortal man shall you perceive; but, scorched by the sun’s bright beams, you shall lose the fair bloom of your flesh. And glad you shall be when spangled-robed night shall veil his brightness and	προσπασσαλεύσω τῷδʼ ἀπανθρώπῳ πάγῳ ἵνʼ οὔτε φωνὴν οὔτε του μορφὴν βροτῶν ὄψει, σταθευτὸς δʼ ἡλίου φοίβῃ φλογὶ χροιᾶς ἀμείψεις ἄνθος. ἀσμένῳ δέ σοι ἡ ποικιλείμων νὺξ ἀποκρύψει φάος,
when the sun shall scatter again the frost of morning. Evermore the burden of your present ill shall wear you out; for your deliverer is not yet born. Such is the prize you have gained for your championship of man. For, god though you are, you did not fear the wrath of the gods, but	πάχνην θʼ ἑῴαν ἥλιος σκεδᾷ πάλιν· ἀεὶ δὲ τοῦ παρόντος ἀχθηδὼν κακοῦ τρύσει σʼ· ὁ λωφήσων γὰρ οὐ πέφυκέ πω. τοιαῦτʼ ἐπηύρω τοῦ φιλανθρώπου τρόπου. θεὸς θεῶν γὰρ οὐχ ὑποπτήσσων χόλον
you bestowed honors upon mortal creatures beyond their due. Therefore on this joyless rock you must stand sentinel, erect, sleepless, your knee unbent. And many a groan and unavailing lament you shall utter; for the heart of Zeus is hard,	βροτοῖσι τιμὰς ὤπασας πέρα δίκης. ἀνθʼ ὧν ἀτερπῆ τήνδε φρουρήσεις πέτραν ὀρθοστάδην, ἄυπνος, οὐ κάμπτων γόνυ· πολλοὺς δʼ ὀδυρμοὺς καὶ γόους ἀνωφελεῖς φθέγξῃ· Διὸς γὰρ δυσπαραίτητοι φρένες.
and everyone is harsh whose power is new.	ἅπας δὲ τραχὺς ὅστις ἂν νέον κρατῇ.
Well, why delay and excite pity in vain? Why do you not detest a god most hateful to the gods, since he has betrayed your prerogative to mortals?	εἶεν, τί μέλλεις καὶ κατοικτίζῃ μάτην; τί τὸν θεοῖς ἔχθιστον οὐ στυγεῖς θεόν, ὅστις τὸ σὸν θνητοῖσι προὔδωκεν γέρας;
A strangely potent tie is kinship, and companionship as well.	τὸ συγγενές τοι δεινὸν ἥ θʼ ὁμιλία.
I agree; yet to refuse to obey the commands of the Father; is this possible? Do you not fear that more?	σύμφημʼ· ἀνηκουστεῖν δὲ τῶν πατρὸς λόγων οἷόν τε πῶς; οὐ τοῦτο δειμαίνεις πλέον;
Yes, you are ever pitiless and steeped in insolence.	αἰεί γε δὴ νηλὴς σὺ καὶ θράσους πλέως.
Yes, for it does not good to bemoan this fellow. Stop wasting your labor at an unprofitable task.	ἄκος γὰρ οὐδὲν τόνδε θρηνεῖσθαι. σὺ δὲ τὰ μηδὲν ὠφελοῦντα μὴ πόνει μάτην.
Oh handicraft that I hate so much!	ὦ πολλὰ μισηθεῖσα χειρωναξία.
Why hate it? Since in truth your craft is in no way to blame for these present troubles.	τί νιν στυγεῖς; πόνων γὰρ ὡς ἁπλῷ λόγῳ τῶν νῦν παρόντων οὐδὲν αἰτία τέχνη.
Nevertheless, i wish it had fallen to another’s lot!	ἔμπας τις αὐτὴν ἄλλος ὤφελεν λαχεῖν.
Every job is troublesome except to be the commander of gods;	ἅπαντʼ ἐπαχθῆ πλὴν θεοῖσι κοιρανεῖν·
no one is free except Zeus.	ἐλεύθερος γὰρ οὔτις ἐστὶ πλὴν Διός.
I know it by this task; I cannot deny it.	ἔγνωκα τοῖσδε κοὐδὲν ἀντειπεῖν ἔχω.
Hurry then to cast the fetters about him, so that the Father does not see you loitering.	οὔκουν ἐπείξῃ τῷδε δεσμὰ περιβαλεῖν, ὡς μή σʼ ἐλινύοντα προσδερχθῇ πατήρ;
Well, there then! The bands are ready, as you may see.	καὶ δὴ πρόχειρα ψάλια δέρκεσθαι πάρα.
Cast them about his wrists and with might strike with your hammer; rivet him to the rocks.	βαλών νιν ἀμφὶ χερσὶν ἐγκρατεῖ σθένει ῥαιστῆρι θεῖνε, πασσάλευε πρὸς πέτραις.
There! The work is getting done and not improperly.	περαίνεται δὴ κοὐ ματᾷ τοὔργον τόδε.
Strike harder, clamp him tight, leave nothing loose; for he is wondrously clever at finding a way even out of desperate straits.	ἄρασσε μᾶλλον, σφίγγε, μηδαμῇ χάλα. δεινὸς γὰρ εὑρεῖν κἀξ ἀμηχάνων πόρον.
This arm, at least, is fixed permanently.	ἄραρεν ἥδε γʼ ὠλένη δυσεκλύτως.
Now rivet this one too and securely, so that he may learn, for all his cleverness, that he is a fool compared to Zeus.	καὶ τήνδε νῦν πόρπασον ἀσφαλῶς, ἵνα μάθῃ σοφιστὴς ὢν Διὸς νωθέστερος.
None but he could justly blame my work.	πλὴν τοῦδʼ ἂν οὐδεὶς ἐνδίκως μέμψαιτό μοι.
Now drive the adamantine wedge’s stubborn edge straight	ἀδαμαντίνου νῦν σφηνὸς αὐθάδη γνάθον
through his chest with your full force.	στέρνων διαμπὰξ πασσάλευʼ ἐρρωμένως.
Alas, Prometheus, I groan for your sufferings.	αἰαῖ, Προμηθεῦ, σῶν ὑπερστένω πόνων.
What! Shrinking again and groaning over the enemies of Zeus? Take care, so that the day does not come when you shall grieve for yourself.	σὺ δʼ αὖ κατοκνεῖς τῶν Διός τʼ ἐχθρῶν ὕπερ στένεις; ὅπως μὴ σαυτὸν οἰκτιεῖς ποτε.
You see a spectacle grievous for eyes to behold.	ὁρᾷς θέαμα δυσθέατον ὄμμασιν.
I see this man getting his deserts. Come, cast the girths about his sides.	ὁρῶ κυροῦντα τόνδε τῶν ἐπαξίων. ἀλλʼ ἀμφὶ πλευραῖς μασχαλιστῆρας βάλε.
I must do this; spare me your needless ordering.	δρᾶν ταῦτʼ ἀνάγκη, μηδὲν ἐγκέλευʼ ἄγαν.
Indeed, I’ll order you, yes and more—I’ll hound you on. Get down below, and ring his legs by force.	ἦ μὴν κελεύσω κἀπιθωύξω γε πρός. χώρει κάτω, σκέλη δὲ κίρκωσον βίᾳ.
There now! The work’s done and without much labor.	καὶ δὴ πέπρακται τοὔργον οὐ μακρῷ πόνῳ.
Now hammer the piercing fetters with your full force; for the appraiser of our work is severe.	ἐρρωμένως νῦν θεῖνε διατόρους πέδας· ὡς οὑπιτιμητής γε τῶν ἔργων βαρύς.
The utterance of your tongue matches your looks.	ὅμοια μορφῇ γλῶσσά σου γηρύεται.
Be softhearted then,	σὺ μαλθακίζου, τὴν δʼ ἐμὴν αὐθαδίαν
but do not attack my stubborn will and my harsh mood.	ὀργῆς τε τραχύτητα μὴ ʼπίπλησσέ μοι.
Let us be gone, since he has got the fetters on his limbs.	στείχωμεν, ὡς κώλοισιν ἀμφίβληστρʼ ἔχει.
There now, indulge your insolence, keep on wresting from the gods their honors to give them to creatures of a day. Are mortals able to lighten your load of sorrow?	ἐνταῦθα νῦν ὕβριζε καὶ θεῶν γέρα συλῶν ἐφημέροισι προστίθει. τί σοι οἷοί τε θνητοὶ τῶνδʼ ἀπαντλῆσαι πόνων;
Falsely the gods call you Prometheus, for you yourself need forethought to free yourself from this handiwork.	ψευδωνύμως σε δαίμονες Προμηθέα καλοῦσιν· αὐτὸν γάρ σε δεῖ προμηθέως, ὅτῳ τρόπῳ τῆσδʼ ἐκκυλισθήσῃ τέχνης.
O you bright sky of heaven, you swift-winged breezes, you river-waters, and	ὦ δῖος αἰθὴρ καὶ ταχύπτεροι πνοαί, ποταμῶν τε πηγαί, ποντίων τε κυμάτων
infinite laughter of the waves of ocean, O universal mother Earth , and you, all-seeing orb of the sun, to you I call! See what I, a god, endure from the gods.	ἀνήριθμον γέλασμα, παμμῆτόρ τε γῆ, καὶ τὸν πανόπτην κύκλον ἡλίου καλῶ. ἴδεσθέ μʼ οἷα πρὸς θεῶν πάσχω θεός.
Look, with what shameful torture I am racked and must wrestle	δέρχθηθʼ οἵαις αἰκείαισιν διακναιόμενος τὸν μυριετῆ
throughout the countless years of time apportioned me. Such is the ignominious bondage the new commander of the blessed has devised against me. Woe! Woe! For present misery and misery to come I groan, not knowing where	χρόνον ἀθλεύσω. τοιόνδʼ ὁ νέος ταγὸς μακάρων ἐξηῦρʼ ἐπʼ ἐμοὶ δεσμὸν ἀεικῆ. φεῦ φεῦ, τὸ παρὸν τό τʼ ἐπερχόμενον πῆμα στενάχω, πῇ ποτε μόχθων
it is fated that deliverance from these sorrows shall arise.	χρὴ τέρματα τῶνδʼ ἐπιτεῖλαι.
And yet, what am I saying? All that is to be I know full well and in advance, nor shall any affliction come upon me unforeseen. I must bear my allotted doom as lightly as I can, knowing that	καίτοι τί φημι; πάντα προυξεπίσταμαι σκεθρῶς τὰ μέλλοντʼ, οὐδέ μοι ποταίνιον πῆμʼ οὐδὲν ἥξει. τὴν πεπρωμένην δὲ χρὴ αἶσαν φέρειν ὡς ῥᾷστα, γιγνώσκονθʼ ὅτι
the might of Necessity permits no resistance.Yet I am not able to speak nor be silent about my fate. For it is because I bestowed good gifts on mortals that this miserable yoke of constraint has been bound upon me. I hunted out and stored in fennel stalk the stolen	τὸ τῆς ἀνάγκης ἔστʼ ἀδήριτον σθένος. ἀλλʼ οὔτε σιγᾶν οὔτε μὴ σιγᾶν τύχας οἷόν τέ μοι τάσδʼ ἐστί. θνητοῖς γὰρ γέρα πορὼν ἀνάγκαις ταῖσδʼ ἐνέζευγμαι τάλας. ναρθηκοπλήρωτον δὲ θηρῶμαι πυρὸς
source of fire that has proved a teacher to mortals in every art and a means to mighty ends. Such is the offence for which I pay the penalty, riveted in fetters beneath the open sky.	πηγὴν κλοπαίαν, ἣ διδάσκαλος τέχνης πάσης βροτοῖς πέφηνε καὶ μέγας πόρος. τοιῶνδε ποινὰς ἀμπλακημάτων τίνω ὑπαιθρίοις δεσμοῖς πεπασσαλευμένος.
Ha! Behold!	ἆ ἆ ἔα ἔα.
What murmur, what scent wings to me, its source invisible, heavenly or human, or both? Has someone come to this crag at the edge of the world to stare at my sufferings—or with what motive? Behold me, an ill-fated god, chained,	τίς ἀχώ, τίς ὀδμὰ προσέπτα μʼ ἀφεγγής, θεόσυτος, ἢ βρότειος, ἢ κεκραμένη; ἵκετο τερμόνιον ἐπὶ πάγον πόνων ἐμῶν θεωρός, ἢ τί δὴ θέλων; ὁρᾶτε δεσμώτην με δύσποτμον θεόν
the foe of Zeus,	τὸν Διὸς ἐχθρόν, τὸν πᾶσι θεοῖς
hated of all who enter the court of Zeus, because of my very great love for mankind. Ha! What’s this? What may be this rustling stir of birds I hear	διʼ ἀπεχθείας ἐλθόνθʼ ὁπόσοι τὴν Διὸς αὐλὴν εἰσοιχνεῦσιν, διὰ τὴν λίαν φιλότητα βροτῶν. φεῦ φεῦ, τί ποτʼ αὖ κινάθισμα κλύω
again nearby? The air whirs with the light rush of wings. Whatever approaches causes me alarm.	πέλας οἰωνῶν; αἰθὴρ δʼ ἐλαφραῖς πτερύγων ῥιπαῖς ὑποσυρίζει. πᾶν μοι φοβερὸν τὸ προσέρπον.
Do not fear! For our group has come in swift rivalry of wings to this crag	μηδὲν φοβηθῇς· φιλία γὰρ ἅδε τάξις πτερύγων θοαῖς ἁμίλλαις προσέβα
as friend to you, having won our father’s consent as best we might. The swift-coursing breezes bore me on; for the reverberation of the clang of iron pierced the depths of our caves and drove my grave modesty away in fright;	τόνδε πάγον, πατρῴας μόγις παρειποῦσα φρένας. κραιπνοφόροι δέ μʼ ἔπεμψαν αὖραι· κτύπου γὰρ ἀχὼ χάλυβος διῇξεν ἄντρων μυχόν, ἐκ δʼ ἔπληξέ μου τὰν θεμερῶπιν αἰδῶ·
unsandalled I have hastened in a winged car.	σύθην δʼ ἀπέδιλος ὄχῳ πτερωτῷ.
Alas! Alas! Offspring of fruitful Tethys and of him who with his sleepless current encircles the whole earth, children of your	αἰαῖ αἰαῖ, τῆς πολυτέκνου Τηθύος ἔκγονα, τοῦ περὶ πᾶσάν θʼ εἱλισσομένου χθόνʼ ἀκοιμήτῳ ῥεύματι παῖδες
father Oceanus, behold, see with what fetters, upon the summit crag of this ravine, I am to hold my unenviable watch.	πατρὸς, Ὠκεανοῦ, δέρχθητʼ, ἐσίδεσθʼ οἵῳ δεσμῷ, προσπορπατὸς τῆσδε φάραγγος σκοπέλοις ἐν ἄκροις φρουρὰν ἄζηλον ὀχήσω.
I see, Prometheus;	λεύσσω, Προμηθεῦ· φοβερὰ
and over my eyes a mist of tears and fear spread as I saw your body withering ignominiously upon this rock in these bonds of adamant. For there are new rulers in heaven, and Zeus governs with	δʼ ἐμοῖσιν ὄσσοις ὀμίχλα προσῇξε πλήρης δακρύων σὸν δέμας εἰσιδούσᾳ πέτραις προσαυαινόμενον ταῖσδʼ ἀδαμαντοδέτοισι λύμαις.
lawless customs; that which was mighty before he now brings to nothing.	νέοι γὰρ οἰακονόμοι κρατοῦσʼ, Ὀλύμπου· νεοχμοῖς δὲ δὴ νόμοις Ζεὺς ἀθέτως κρατύνει. τὰ πρὶν δὲ πελώρια νῦν ἀιστοῖ.
Oh if only he had hurled me below the earth, yes beneath Hades, the entertainer of the dead, into impassable Tartarus,	εἰ γάρ μʼ ὑπὸ γῆν νέρθεν θʼ Ἅιδου τοῦ νεκροδέγμονος εἰς ἀπέρατον Τάρταρον ἧκεν,
and had ruthlessly fastened me in fetters no hand can loose, so that neither god nor any other might have gloated over this agony I feel! But, now, a miserable plaything of the winds, I suffer pains to delight my enemies.	δεσμοῖς ἀλύτοις ἀγρίως πελάσας, ὡς μήτε θεὸς μήτε τις ἄλλος τοῖσδʼ ἐπεγήθει. νῦν δʼ αἰθέριον κίνυγμʼ ὁ τάλας ἐχθροῖς ἐπίχαρτα πέπονθα.
Who of the gods is so hard of heart as to exult in this? Who does not sympathize with your woes—save only Zeus? But he in malice, has set his soul inflexibly	τίς ὧδε τλησικάρδιος θεῶν, ὅτῳ τάδʼ ἐπιχαρῆ; τίς οὐ ξυνασχαλᾷ κακοῖς τεοῖσι, δίχα γε Διός; ὁ δʼ ἐπικότως ἀεὶ θέμενος ἄγναμπτον νόον
and keeps in subjection the race sprung from Uranus; nor will he stop, until he has satiated his soul or another seizes his impregnable empire by some device of guile.	δάμναται Οὐρανίαν γένναν, οὐδὲ λήξει, πρὶν ἂν ἢ κορέσῃ κέαρ ἢ παλάμᾳ τινὶ τὰν δυσάλωτον ἕλῃ τις ἀρχάν.
Truly the day shall come when, although I am tortured in stubborn fetters,	ἦ μὴν ἔτʼ ἐμοῦ, καίπερ κρατεραῖς ἐν γυιοπέδαις αἰκιζομένου,
the prince of the blessed will need me to reveal the new design whereby he shall be stripped of his sceptre and his dignities. Not by persuasion’s honeyed enchantments will he charm me;	χρείαν ἕξει μακάρων πρύτανις, δεῖξαι τὸ νέον βούλευμʼ ὑφʼ ὅτου σκῆπτρον τιμάς τʼ ἀποσυλᾶται. καί μʼ οὔτι μελιγλώσσοις πειθοῦς ἐπαοιδαῖσιν θέλξει, στερεάς τʼ
and I will never, cowering before his dire threats, divulge this secret, until he releases me from my cruel bonds and provides compensation for this outrage.	οὔποτʼ ἀπειλὰς πτήξας τόδʼ ἐγὼ καταμηνύσω, πρὶν ἂν ἐξ ἀγρίων δεσμῶν χαλάσῃ ποινάς τε τίνειν τῆσδʼ αἰκείας ἐθελήσῃ.
You are bold, and do not yield to your bitter pangs; you give too much license to your tongue. But my soul is agitated by piercing fear, and I am in dread about your fate,	σὺ μὲν θρασύς τε καὶ πικραῖς δύαισιν οὐδὲν ἐπιχαλᾷς, ἄγαν δʼ ἐλευθεροστομεῖς. ἐμὰς δὲ φρένας ἐρέθισε διάτορος φόβος· δέδια δʼ ἀμφὶ σαῖς τύχαις,
wondering to what haven you must steer your ship to see an end of your voyage of sorrow. For the heart of Cronus’ son is hardened against entreaty and his ways are inexorable.	πᾷ ποτε τῶνδε πόνων χρή σε τέρμα κέλ- σαντʼ ἐσιδεῖν· ἀκίχητα γὰρ ἤθεα καὶ κέαρ ἀπαράμυθον ἔχει Κρόνου παῖς.
I know that Zeus is harsh and	οἶδʼ ὅτι τραχὺς καὶ παρʼ ἑαυτῷ
keeps justice in his own hands; but nevertheless one day his judgement will soften, when he has been crushed in the way that I know. Then, calming down his stubborn wrath, he shall at last bond with me in union and friendship,	τὸ δίκαιον ἔχων Ζεύς. ἀλλʼ ἔμπας μαλακογνώμων ἔσται ποθʼ, ὅταν ταύτῃ ῥαισθῇ· τὴν δʼ ἀτέραμνον στορέσας ὀργὴν εἰς ἀρθμὸν ἐμοὶ καὶ φιλότητα
as eager as I am to welcome him.	σπεύδων σπεύδοντί ποθʼ ἥξει.
Unfold the whole story and tell us upon what charge Zeus has caught you and painfully punishes you with such dishonor. Instruct us, unless, indeed, there is some harm in telling. It is painful to me to tell the tale,	πάντʼ ἐκκάλυψον καὶ γέγωνʼ ἡμῖν λόγον, ποίῳ λαβών σε Ζεὺς ἐπʼ αἰτιάματι, οὕτως ἀτίμως καὶ πικρῶς αἰκίζεται· δίδαξον ἡμᾶς, εἴ τι μὴ βλάπτει λόγῳ.
painful to keep it silent. My case is unfortunate every way. When first the heavenly powers were moved to wrath, and mutual dissension was stirred up among them—some bent on casting Cronus from his seat so Zeus, in truth, might reign; others, eager for	ἀλγεινὰ μέν μοι καὶ λέγειν ἐστὶν τάδε, ἄλγος δὲ σιγᾶν, πανταχῇ δὲ δύσποτμα. ἐπεὶ τάχιστʼ ἤρξαντο δαίμονες χόλου στάσις τʼ ἐν ἀλλήλοισιν ὠροθύνετο, οἱ μὲν θέλοντες ἐκβαλεῖν ἕδρας Κρόνον, ὡς Ζεὺς ἀνάσσοι δῆθεν, οἱ δὲ τοὔμπαλιν
the contrary end, that Zeus might never win mastery over the gods—it was then that I, although advising them for the best, was unable to persuade the Titans, children of Heaven and Earth; but they, disdaining counsels of craft, in the pride of their strength	σπεύδοντες, ὡς Ζεὺς μήποτʼ ἄρξειεν θεῶν, ἐνταῦθʼ ἐγὼ τὰ λῷστα βουλεύων πιθεῖν Τιτᾶνας, Οὐρανοῦ τε καὶ Χθονὸς τέκνα, οὐκ ἠδυνήθην. αἱμύλας δὲ μηχανὰς ἀτιμάσαντες καρτεροῖς φρονήμασιν
thought to gain the mastery without a struggle and by force. Often my mother Themis, or Earth (though one form, she had many names), had foretold to me the way in which the future was fated to come to pass. That it was not by brute strength nor through violence,	ᾤοντʼ ἀμοχθεὶ πρὸς βίαν τε δεσπόσειν· ἐμοὶ δὲ μήτηρ οὐχ ἅπαξ μόνον Θέμις, καὶ Γαῖα, πολλῶν ὀνομάτων μορφὴ μία, τὸ μέλλον ᾗ κραίνοιτο προυτεθεσπίκει, ὡς οὐ κατʼ ἰσχὺν οὐδὲ πρὸς τὸ καρτερόν
but by guile that those who should gain the upper hand were destined to prevail. And though I argued all this to them, they did not pay any attention to my words. With all that before me, it seemed best that, joining with my mother, I should place myself,	χρείη, δόλῳ δὲ τοὺς ὑπερσχόντας κρατεῖν. τοιαῦτʼ ἐμοῦ λόγοισιν ἐξηγουμένου οὐκ ἠξίωσαν οὐδὲ προσβλέψαι τὸ πᾶν. κράτιστα δή μοι τῶν παρεστώτων τότε ἐφαίνετʼ εἶναι προσλαβόντα μητέρα
a welcome volunteer, on the side of Zeus; and it is by reason of my counsel that the cavernous gloom of Tartarus now hides ancient Cronus and his allies within it. Thus I helped the tyrant of the gods	ἑκόνθʼ ἑκόντι Ζηνὶ συμπαραστατεῖν. ἐμαῖς δὲ βουλαῖς Ταρτάρου μελαμβαθὴς κευθμὼν καλύπτει τὸν παλαιγενῆ Κρόνον αὐτοῖσι συμμάχοισι. τοιάδʼ ἐξ ἐμοῦ ὁ τῶν θεῶν τύραννος ὠφελημένος
and with this foul payment he has responded; for it is a disease that is somehow inherent in tyranny to have no faith in friends. However, you ask why he torments me, and this I will now make clear.	κακαῖσι ποιναῖς ταῖσδὲ μʼ ἐξημείψατο. ἔνεστι γάρ πως τοῦτο τῇ τυραννίδι νόσημα, τοῖς φίλοισι μὴ πεποιθέναι. ὃ δʼ οὖν ἐρωτᾶτʼ, αἰτίαν καθʼ ἥντινα αἰκίζεταί με, τοῦτο δὴ σαφηνιῶ.
As soon as he had seated himself upon his father’s throne, he immediately assigned to the deities their several privileges and apportioned to them their proper powers. But of wretched mortals he took no notice, desiring to bring	ὅπως τάχιστα τὸν πατρῷον ἐς θρόνον καθέζετʼ, εὐθὺς δαίμοσιν νέμει γέρα ἄλλοισιν ἄλλα καὶ διεστοιχίζετο ἀρχήν· βροτῶν δὲ τῶν ταλαιπώρων λόγον οὐκ ἔσχεν οὐδένʼ, ἀλλʼ ἀιστώσας γένος
the whole race to an end and create a new one in its place. Against this purpose none dared make stand except me— I only had the courage; I saved mortals so that they did not descend, blasted utterly, to the house of Hades. This is why I am bent by such grievous tortures,	τὸ πᾶν ἔχρῃζεν ἄλλο φιτῦσαι νέον. καὶ τοῖσιν οὐδεὶς ἀντέβαινε πλὴν ἐμοῦ. ἐγὼ δʼ ἐτόλμησʼ· ἐξελυσάμην βροτοὺς τὸ μὴ διαρραισθέντας εἰς Ἅιδου μολεῖν. τῷ τοι τοιαῖσδε πημοναῖσι κάμπτομαι,
painful to suffer, piteous to behold. I who gave mortals first place in my pity, I am deemed unworthy to win this pity for myself, but am in this way mercilessly disciplined, a spectacle that shames the glory of Zeus.	πάσχειν μὲν ἀλγειναῖσιν, οἰκτραῖσιν δʼ ἰδεῖν· θνητοὺς δʼ ἐν οἴκτῳ προθέμενος, τούτου τυχεῖν οὐκ ἠξιώθην αὐτός, ἀλλὰ νηλεῶς ὧδʼ ἐρρύθμισμαι, Ζηνὶ δυσκλεὴς θέα.
Iron-hearted and made of stone, Prometheus,	σιδηρόφρων τε κἀκ πέτρας εἰργασμένος
is he who feels no compassion at your miseries. For myself, I would not have desired to see them; and now that I see them, I am pained in my heart.	ὅστις, Προμηθεῦ, σοῖσιν οὐ συνασχαλᾷ μόχθοις· ἐγὼ γὰρ οὔτʼ ἂν εἰσιδεῖν τάδε ἔχρῃζον εἰσιδοῦσά τʼ ἠλγύνθην κέαρ.
Yes, to my friends indeed I am a spectacle of pity.	καὶ μὴν φίλοις γʼ ἐλεινὸς εἰσορᾶν ἐγώ.
Did you perhaps transgress even somewhat beyond this offence?	μή πού τι προύβης τῶνδε καὶ περαιτέρω;
Yes, I caused mortals to cease foreseeing their doom.	θνητούς γʼ ἔπαυσα μὴ προδέρκεσθαι μόρον.
Of what sort was the cure that you found for this affliction?	τὸ ποῖον εὑρὼν τῆσδε φάρμακον νόσου;
I caused blind hopes to dwell within their breasts.	τυφλὰς ἐν αὐτοῖς ἐλπίδας κατῴκισα.
A great benefit was this you gave to mortals.	μέγʼ ὠφέλημα τοῦτʼ ἐδωρήσω βροτοῖς.
In addition, I gave them fire.	πρὸς τοῖσδε μέντοι πῦρ ἐγώ σφιν ὤπασα.
What! Do creatures of a day now have flame-eyed fire?	καὶ νῦν φλογωπὸν πῦρ ἔχουσʼ ἐφήμεροι;
Yes, and from it they shall learn many arts.	ἀφʼ οὗ γε πολλὰς ἐκμαθήσονται τέχνας.
Then it was on a charge like this that Zeus—	τοιοῖσδε δή σε Ζεὺς ἐπʼ αἰτιάμασιν—
Torments me and in no way gives me respite from pain.	αἰκίζεταί τε κοὐδαμῇ χαλᾷ κακῶν.
And is there no end assigned to your ordeal?	οὐδʼ ἔστιν ἄθλου τέρμα σοι προκείμενον;
No, none except when it seems good to him.	οὐκ ἄλλο γʼ οὐδέν, πλὴν ὅταν κείνῳ δοκῇ.
But how will it seem good to him? What hope is there? Do you not see that you have wronged? And yet it is not pleasant for me to talk about how you have wronged, and for you it is pain. So, let us quit this theme; and may you seek some release from your ordeal.	δόξει δὲ πῶς; τίς ἐλπίς; οὐχ ὁρᾷς ὅτι ἥμαρτες; ὡς δʼ ἥμαρτες οὔτʼ ἐμοὶ λέγειν καθʼ ἡδονὴν σοί τʼ ἄλγος. ἀλλὰ ταῦτα μὲν μεθῶμεν, ἄθλου δʼ ἔκλυσιν ζήτει τινά.
It is easy for him who keeps his foot free from harm to counsel and admonish him who is in misery. I have known this all the while. Of my own will, yes, of my own will I erred—I will not deny it. By helping mortals I found suffering for myself;	ἐλαφρὸν ὅστις πημάτων ἔξω πόδα ἔχει παραινεῖν νουθετεῖν τε τὸν κακῶς πράσσοντʼ· ἐγὼ δὲ ταῦθʼ ἅπαντʼ ἠπιστάμην. ἑκὼν ἑκὼν ἥμαρτον, οὐκ ἀρνήσομαι· θνητοῖς ἀρήγων αὐτὸς ηὑρόμην πόνους.
nevertheless I did not think I would be punished in this way—wasting away upon cliffs in mid-air, my portion this desolate and dreary crag. And now, bewail no more my present woes; alight on the ground and listen to my	οὐ μήν τι ποιναῖς γʼ ᾠόμην τοίαισί με κατισχνανεῖσθαι πρὸς πέτραις πεδαρσίοις, τυχόντʼ ἐρήμου τοῦδʼ ἀγείτονος πάγου. καί μοι τὰ μὲν παρόντα μὴ δύρεσθʼ ἄχη, πέδοι δὲ βᾶσαι τὰς προσερπούσας τύχας
oncoming fortunes so that you may be told them from end to end. Consent, I beg you, oh consent. Take part in the trouble of him who is now in sore distress. In truth, affliction wanders impartially abroad and alights upon all in turn.	ἀκούσαθʼ, ὡς μάθητε διὰ τέλους τὸ πᾶν. πίθεσθέ μοι πίθεσθε, συμπονήσατε τῷ νῦν μογοῦντι. ταὐτά τοι πλανωμένη πρὸς ἄλλοτʼ ἄλλον πημονὴ προσιζάνει.
Not to unwilling ears have you made this appeal,	οὐκ ἀκούσαις ἐπεθώυξας
Prometheus. And so now with light foot I will quit my swift-speeding seat and the pure air, the pathway of birds and draw near to this rugged ground; for I want to hear	τοῦτο, Προμηθεῦ. καὶ νῦν ἐλαφρῷ ποδὶ κραιπνόσυτον θᾶκον προλιποῦσʼ, αἰθέρα θʼ ἁγνὸν πόρον οἰωνῶν, ὀκριοέσσῃ χθονὶ τῇδε πελῶ, τοὺς σοὺς δὲ πόνους
the whole story of your sorrows.	χρῄζω διὰ παντὸς ἀκοῦσαι.
I have come to the end of a long journey in my passage to you, Prometheus, guiding by my own will, without a bridle, this swift-winged bird.	ἥκω δολιχῆς τέρμα κελεύθου διαμειψάμενος πρὸς σέ, Προμηθεῦ, τὸν πτερυγωκῆ τόνδʼ οἰωνὸν γνώμῃ στομίων ἄτερ εὐθύνων·
For your fate, you may be sure, I feel compassion. Kinship, I think, constrains me to this; and, apart from blood ties, there is none to whom I should pay greater respect than to you.	ταῖς σαῖς δὲ τύχαις, ἴσθι, συναλγῶ. τὸ τε γάρ με, δοκῶ, συγγενὲς οὕτως ἐσαναγκάζει, χωρίς τε γένους οὐκ ἔστιν ὅτῳ μείζονα μοῖραν νείμαιμʼ ἢ σοί.
You shall know this for simple truth and that it is not in me to utter vain and empty words; come, tell me; what aid can I render you? For you shall never say that you have a friend more loyal than Oceanus.	γνώσῃ δὲ τάδʼ ὡς ἔτυμʼ, οὐδὲ μάτην χαριτογλωσσεῖν ἔνι μοι· φέρε γὰρ σήμαινʼ ὅ τι χρή σοι συμπράσσειν· οὐ γάρ ποτʼ ἐρεῖς ὡς Ὠκεανοῦ φίλος ἐστὶ βεβαιότερός σοι.
Ha! What have we here? So then you too have come to stare upon my sufferings? How did you summon courage to quit the stream that bears your name and the rock-roofed caves you yourself have made and come to this land, the mother of iron? Is it that you have come	ἔα· τί χρῆμα λεύσσω; καὶ σὺ δὴ πόνων ἐμῶν ἥκεις ἐπόπτης; πῶς ἐτόλμησας, λιπὼν ἐπώνυμόν τε ῥεῦμα καὶ πετρηρεφῆ αὐτόκτιτʼ ἄντρα, τὴν σιδηρομήτορα ἐλθεῖν ἐς αἶαν; ἦ θεωρήσων τύχας
to gaze upon my state and join your grief to my distress? Look upon me here—a spectacle, the friend of Zeus, who helped him to establish his sovereign power, by what anguish I am bent by him!	ἐμὰς ἀφῖξαι καὶ συνασχαλῶν κακοῖς; δέρκου θέαμα, τόνδε τὸν Διὸς φίλον, τὸν συγκαταστήσαντα τὴν τυραννίδα, οἵαις ὑπʼ αὐτοῦ πημοναῖσι κάμπτομαι.
I see, Prometheus; and I want to give you	ὁρῶ, Προμηθεῦ, καὶ παραινέσαι γέ σοι
the best advice, although you yourself are wily. Learn to know yourself and adapt yourself to new ways; for new also is the ruler among the gods. If you hurl forth words so harsh and of such whetted edge, perhaps Zeus may hear you,	θέλω τὰ λῷστα, καίπερ ὄντι ποικίλῳ. γίγνωσκε σαυτὸν καὶ μεθάρμοσαι τρόπους νέους· νέος γὰρ καὶ τύραννος ἐν θεοῖς. εἰ δʼ ὧδε τραχεῖς καὶ τεθηγμένους λόγους ῥίψεις, τάχʼ ἄν σου καὶ μακρὰν ἀνωτέρω
though throned far off, high in the heavens, and then your present multitude of sorrows shall seem but childish sport. Oh wretched sufferer! Put away your wrathful mood and try to find release from these miseries. Perhaps this advice may seem to you old and dull;	θακῶν κλύοι Ζεύς, ὥστε σοι τὸν νῦν ὄχλον παρόντα μόχθων παιδιὰν εἶναι δοκεῖν. ἀλλʼ, ὦ ταλαίπωρʼ, ἃς ἔχεις ὀργὰς ἄφες, ζήτει δὲ τῶνδε πημάτων ἀπαλλαγάς. ἀρχαῖʼ ἴσως σοι φαίνομαι λέγειν τάδε·
but your plight, Prometheus, is only the wages of too boastful speech. You still have not learned humility, nor do you bend before misfortune, but would rather add even more miseries to those you have. Therefore take me as your teacher	τοιαῦτα μέντοι τῆς ἄγαν ὑψηγόρου γλώσσης, Προμηθεῦ, τἀπίχειρα γίγνεται. σὺ δʼ οὐδέπω ταπεινὸς οὐδʼ εἴκεις κακοῖς, πρὸς τοῖς παροῦσι δʼ ἄλλα προσλαβεῖν θέλεις. οὔκουν ἔμοιγε χρώμενος διδασκάλῳ
and do not add insult to injury, seeing that a harsh monarch now rules who is accountable to no one. So now I will depart and see whether I can release you from these sufferings. And may you hold your peace and be not too blustering of speech.	πρὸς κέντρα κῶλον ἐκτενεῖς, ὁρῶν ὅτι τραχὺς μόναρχος οὐδʼ ὑπεύθυνος κρατεῖ. καὶ νῦν ἐγὼ μὲν εἶμι καὶ πειράσομαι ἐὰν δύνωμαι τῶνδέ σʼ ἐκλῦσαι πόνων. σὺ δʼ ἡσύχαζε μηδʼ ἄγαν λαβροστόμει.
Or, can it be that for all your exceeding wisdom, you do not know that chastisement is inflicted on a wagging tongue?	ἢ οὐκ οἶσθʼ ἀκριβῶς ὢν περισσόφρων ὅτι γλώσσῃ ματαίᾳ ζημία προστρίβεται;
I envy you because you have escaped blame for having dared to share with me in my troubles. So now leave me alone and let it not concern you.	ζηλῶ σʼ ὁθούνεκʼ ἐκτὸς αἰτίας κυρεῖς τούτων μετασχεῖν καὶ τετολμηκὼς ἐμοί. καὶ νῦν ἔασον μηδέ σοι μελησάτω.
Do what you want, you cannot persuade him; for he is not easy to persuade. Beware that you do not do yourself harm by the mission you take.	πάντως γὰρ οὐ πείσεις νιν· οὐ γὰρ εὐπιθής. πάπταινε δʼ αὐτὸς μή τι πημανθῇς ὁδῷ.
In truth, you are far better able to admonish others than yourself. It is by fact, not by hearsay, that I judge.	πολλῷ γʼ ἀμείνων τοὺς πέλας φρενοῦν ἔφυς ἢ σαυτόν· ἔργῳ κοὐ λόγῳ τεκμαίρομαι.
So do not hold back one who is eager to go. For I am confident, yes, confident, that Zeus will grant me this favor, to free you from your sufferings.	ὁρμώμενον δὲ μηδαμῶς ἀντισπάσῃς. αὐχῶ γὰρ αὐχῶ τήνδε δωρεὰν ἐμοὶ δώσειν Δίʼ, ὥστε τῶνδέ σʼ ἐκλῦσαι πόνων.
I thank you for all this and shall never cease to thank you; in zeal you lack nothing, but do not trouble yourself; for your trouble will be vain and	τὰ μὲν σʼ ἐπαινῶ κοὐδαμῇ λήξω ποτέ· προθυμίας γὰρ οὐδὲν ἐλλείπεις. ἀτὰρ μηδὲν πόνει. μάτην γὰρ οὐδὲν ὠφελῶν
not helpful to me—if indeed you want to take the pain. No, keep quiet and keep yourself clear of harm. For even if I am in sore plight, I would not wish affliction on everyone else. No, certainly, no! since, besides, I am distressed by the fate	ἐμοὶ πονήσεις, εἴ τι καὶ πονεῖν θέλεις. ἀλλʼ ἡσύχαζε σαυτὸν ἐκποδὼν ἔχων· ἐγὼ γὰρ οὐκ, εἰ δυστυχῶ, τοῦδʼ εἵνεκα θέλοιμʼ ἂν ὡς πλείστοισι πημονὰς τυχεῖν. οὐ δῆτʼ ἐπεί με καὶ κασιγνήτου τύχαι
of my brother Atlas, who, towards the west, stands bearing on his shoulders the pillar of heaven and earth, a burden not easy for his arms to grasp. Pity moved me, too, at the sight of the earth-born dweller of the Cilician caves curbed by violence, that destructive monster	τείρουσʼ Ἄτλαντος, ὃς πρὸς ἑσπέρους τόπους ἕστηκε κίονʼ οὐρανοῦ τε καὶ χθονὸς ὤμοις ἐρείδων, ἄχθος οὐκ εὐάγκαλον. τὸν γηγενῆ τε Κιλικίων οἰκήτορα ἄντρων ἰδὼν ᾤκτιρα, δάιον τέρας
of a hundred heads, impetuous Typhon. He withstood all the gods, hissing out terror with horrid jaws, while from his eyes lightened a hideous glare, as though he would storm by force the sovereignty of Zeus.	ἑκατογκάρανον πρὸς βίαν χειρούμενον Τυφῶνα θοῦρον· πᾶσιν ἀντέστη θεοῖς, σμερδναῖσι γαμφηλαῖσι συρίζων φόβον· ἐξ ὀμμάτων δʼ ἤστραπτε γοργωπὸν σέλας, ὡς τὴν Διὸς τυραννίδʼ ἐκπέρσων βίᾳ·
But the unsleeping bolt of Zeus came upon him, the swooping lightning brand with breath of flame, which struck him, frightened, from his loud-mouthed boasts; then, stricken to the very heart, he was burnt to ashes and his strength blasted from him by the lightning bolt.	ἀλλʼ ἦλθεν αὐτῷ Ζηνὸς ἄγρυπνον βέλος, καταιβάτης κεραυνὸς ἐκπνέων φλόγα, ὃς αὐτὸν ἐξέπληξε τῶν ὑψηγόρων κομπασμάτων. φρένας γὰρ εἰς αὐτὰς τυπεὶς ἐφεψαλώθη κἀξεβροντήθη σθένος.
And now, a helpless and a sprawling bulk, he lies hard by the narrows of the sea, pressed down beneath the roots of Aetna ; while on the topmost summit Hephaestus sits and hammers the molten ore. There, one day, shall burst forth	καὶ νῦν ἀχρεῖον καὶ παράορον δέμας κεῖται στενωποῦ πλησίον θαλασσίου ἰπούμενος ῥίζαισιν Αἰτναίαις ὕπο· κορυφαῖς δʼ ἐν ἄκραις ἥμενος μυδροκτυπεῖ Ἥφαιστος· ἔνθεν ἐκραγήσονταί ποτε
rivers of fire, with savage jaws devouring the level fields of Sicily , land of fair fruit—such boiling rage shall Typho, although charred by the blazing lightning of Zeus, send spouting forth with hot jets of appalling, fire-breathing surge.	ποταμοὶ πυρὸς δάπτοντες ἀγρίαις γνάθοις τῆς καλλικάρπου Σικελίας λευροὺς γύας· τοιόνδε Τυφὼς ἐξαναζέσει χόλον θερμοῖς ἀπλάτου βέλεσι πυρπνόου ζάλης, καίπερ κεραυνῷ Ζηνὸς ἠνθρακωμένος.
But you are not inexperienced, and do not need me to teach you. Save yourself, as you know best; while I exhaust my present lot until the time comes when the mind of Zeus shall abandon its wrath.	σὺ δʼ οὐκ ἄπειρος, οὐδʼ ἐμοῦ διδασκάλου χρῄζεις· σεαυτὸν σῷζʼ ὅπως ἐπίστασαι· ἐγὼ δὲ τὴν παροῦσαν ἀντλήσω τύχην, ἔστʼ ἂν Διὸς φρόνημα λωφήσῃ χόλου.
Do you not know then, Prometheus, that	οὔκουν, Προμηθεῦ, τοῦτο γιγνώσκεις, ὅτι
words are the physicians of a disordered temper?	ὀργῆς νοσούσης εἰσὶν ἰατροὶ λόγοι;
If one softens the soul in season, and does not hasten to reduce its swelling rage by violence.	ἐάν τις ἐν καιρῷ γε μαλθάσσῃ κέαρ καὶ μὴ σφριγῶντα θυμὸν ἰσχναίνῃ βίᾳ.
What lurking mischief do you see when daring joins to zeal? Teach me this.	ἐν τῷ προθυμεῖσθαι δὲ καὶ τολμᾶν τίνα ὁρᾷς ἐνοῦσαν ζημίαν; δίδασκέ με.
Lost labor and thoughtless simplicity.	μόχθον περισσὸν κουφόνουν τʼ εὐηθίαν.
Leave me to be affected by this, since it is most advantageous, when truly wise, to be deemed a fool.	ἔα με τῇδε τῇ νόσῳ νοσεῖν, ἐπεὶ κέρδιστον εὖ φρονοῦντα μὴ φρονεῖν δοκεῖν.
This fault will be seen to be my own.	ἐμὸν δοκήσει τἀμπλάκημʼ εἶναι τόδε.
Clearly the manner of your speech orders me back home.	σαφῶς μʼ ἐς οἶκον σὸς λόγος στέλλει πάλιν.
So that you won’t win enmity for yourself by lamenting for me.	μὴ γάρ σε θρῆνος οὑμὸς εἰς ἔχθραν βάλῃ.
In the eyes of the one who is newly seated on his omnipotent throne?	ἦ τῷ νέον θακοῦντι παγκρατεῖς ἕδρας;
Beware lest the time come when his heart is angered with you.	τούτου φυλάσσου μή ποτʼ ἀχθεσθῇ κέαρ.
Your plight, Prometheus, is my instructor.	ἡ σή, Προμηθεῦ, συμφορὰ διδάσκαλος.
Go away, depart, keep your present purpose.	στέλλου, κομίζου, σῷζε τὸν παρόντα νοῦν.
Your urging meets my eagerness; for my four-footed winged beast fans with his wings the smooth pathway of the air; and truly he will be glad to rest his knees in his stall at home.	ὁρμωμένῳ μοι τόνδʼ ἐθώυξας λόγον. λευρὸν γὰρ οἷμον αἰθέρος ψαίρει πτεροῖς τετρασκελὴς οἰωνός· ἄσμενος δέ τἂν σταθμοῖς ἐν οἰκείοισι κάμψειεν γόνυ.
I mourn your unfortunate fate, Prometheus.	στένω σε τᾶς οὐλομένας τύχας, Προμηθεῦ·
Shedding from my eyes a coursing flood of tears I wet my tender cheeks with their moist streams. For Zeus, holding this unenviable power by self-appointed laws,	δακρυσίστακτα δʼ ἀπʼ ὄσσων ῥαδινὰν λειβομένα ῥέος παρειὰν νοτίοις ἔτεγξα παγαῖς· ἀμέγαρτα γὰρ τάδε Ζεὺς ἰδίοις νόμοις κρατύνων
displays towards the gods of old an overweening spirit.	ὑπερήφανον θεοῖς τοῖς πάρος ἐνδείκνυσιν αἰχμάν.
Now the whole earth cries aloud in lamentation; . . . lament the greatness of the glory of your time-hallowed honor,	πρόπασα δʼ ἤδη στονόεν λέλακε χώρα, μεγαλοσχήμονά ἀρχαι- οπρεπῆ στένουσι τὰν σὰν
the honor that was yours and your brother’s; and all mortals who make their dwelling place in holy Asia share the anguish of your most lamentable suffering;	ξυνομαιμόνων τε τιμάν, ὁπόσοι τʼ ἔποικον ἁγνᾶς Ἀσίας ἕδος νέμονται, μεγαλοστόνοισι σοῖς πή- μασι συγκάμνουσι θνατοί.
And those who dwell in the land of Colchis , the maidens fearless in fight; and the Scythian multitude that inhabits the most remote region of the earth bordering the Maeotic lake;	Κολχίδος τε γᾶς ἔνοικοι παρθένοι, μάχας ἄτρεστοι, καὶ Σκύθης ὅμιλος, οἳ γᾶς ἔσχατον τόπον ἀμφὶ Μαι- ῶτιν ἔχουσι λίμναν,
And the warlike flower of Arabia , which hold the high-cragged citadel near the Caucasus , a hostile host that roars among the sharp-pointed spears.	Ἀραβίας τʼ ἄρειον ἄνθος, ὑψίκρημνον οἳ πόλισμα Καυκάσου πέλας νέμονται, δάιος στρατός, ὀξυπρῴ- ροισι βρέμων ἐν αἰχμαῖς.
One other Titan god before this I have seen in distress, enthralled in torment by adamantine bonds—Atlas, pre-eminent in mighty strength, who moans as he supports	μόνον δὴ πρόσθεν ἄλλον ἐν πόνοις δαμέντʼ ἀδαμαντοδέτοις Τιτᾶνα λύμαις εἰσιδόμαν, θεόν, Ἄτλαντος ; ὑπέροχον σθένος κραταιόν, ὃς οὐράνιόν πόλον
the vault of heaven on his back.	νώτοις στέγων ὑποστενάζει.
The waves of the sea utter a cry as they fall, the deep laments, the black abyss of Hades rumbles in response, and the streams of pure-flowing rivers	βοᾷ δὲ πόντιος κλύδων ξυμπίτνων, στένει βυθός, κελαινὸς δʼ Ἄιδος ὑποβρέμει μυχὸς γᾶς, παγαί θʼ ἁγνορύτων ποταμῶν
lament your piteous pain.	στένουσιν ἄλγος οἰκτρόν.
No, do not think it is from pride or even from wilfulness that I am silent. Painful thoughts devour my heart as I behold myself maltreated in this way. And yet who else but I definitely assigned	μή τοι χλιδῇ δοκεῖτε μηδʼ αὐθαδίᾳ σιγᾶν με· συννοίᾳ δὲ δάπτομαι κέαρ, ὁρῶν ἐμαυτὸν ὧδε προυσελούμενον. καίτοι θεοῖσι τοῖς νέοις τούτοις γέρα
their prerogatives to these upstart gods? But I do not speak of this; for my tale would tell you nothing except what you know. Still, listen to the miseries that beset mankind—how they were witless before and I made them have sense and endowed them with reason.	τίς ἄλλος ἢ ʼγὼ παντελῶς διώρισεν; ἀλλʼ αὐτὰ σιγῶ· καὶ γὰρ εἰδυίαισιν ἂν ὑμῖν λέγοιμι· τἀν βροτοῖς δὲ πήματα ἀκούσαθʼ, ὥς σφας νηπίους ὄντας τὸ πρὶν ἔννους ἔθηκα καὶ φρενῶν ἐπηβόλους.
I will not speak to upbraid mankind but to set forth the friendly purpose that inspired my blessing. First of all, though they had eyes to see, they saw to no avail; they had ears, but they did not understand ; but, just as shapes in dreams, throughout their length of days,	λέξω δέ, μέμψιν οὔτινʼ ἀνθρώποις ἔχων, ἀλλʼ ὧν δέδωκʼ εὔνοιαν ἐξηγούμενος· οἳ πρῶτα μὲν βλέποντες ἔβλεπον μάτην, κλύοντες οὐκ ἤκουον, ἀλλʼ ὀνειράτων ἀλίγκιοι μορφαῖσι τὸν μακρὸν βίον
without purpose they wrought all things in confusion. They had neither knowledge of houses built of bricks and turned to face the sun nor yet of work in wood; but dwelt beneath the ground like swarming ants, in sunless caves. They had no sign either of winter	ἔφυρον εἰκῇ πάντα, κοὔτε πλινθυφεῖς δόμους προσείλους, ᾖσαν, οὐ ξυλουργίαν· κατώρυχες δʼ ἔναιον ὥστʼ ἀήσυροι μύρμηκες ἄντρων ἐν μυχοῖς ἀνηλίοις. ἦν δʼ οὐδὲν αὐτοῖς οὔτε χείματος τέκμαρ
or of flowery spring or of fruitful summer, on which they could depend but managed everything without judgment, until I taught them to discern the risings of the stars and their settings, which are difficult to distinguish. Yes, and numbers, too, chiefest of sciences,	οὔτʼ ἀνθεμώδους ἦρος οὔτε καρπίμου θέρους βέβαιον, ἀλλʼ ἄτερ γνώμης τὸ πᾶν ἔπρασσον, ἔστε δή σφιν ἀντολὰς ἐγὼ ἄστρων ἔδειξα τάς τε δυσκρίτους δύσεις. καὶ μὴν ἀριθμόν, ἔξοχον σοφισμάτων,
I invented for them, and the combining of letters, creative mother of the Muses’ arts, with which to hold all things in memory. I, too, first brought brute beasts beneath the yoke to be subject to the collar and the pack-saddle, so that they might bear in men’s stead their	ἐξηῦρον αὐτοῖς, γραμμάτων τε συνθέσεις, μνήμην ἁπάντων, μουσομήτορʼ ἐργάνην. κἄζευξα πρῶτος ἐν ζυγοῖσι κνώδαλα ζεύγλαισι δουλεύοντα σάγμασὶν θʼ, ὅπως θνητοῖς μεγίστων διάδοχοι μοχθημάτων
heaviest burdens; and to the chariot I harnessed horses and made them obedient to the rein, to be an image of wealth and luxury. It was I and no one else who invented the mariner’s flaxen-winged car that roams the sea. Wretched that I am—such are the arts I devised	γένοινθʼ , ὑφʼ ἅρμα τʼ ἤγαγον φιληνίους ἵππους, ἄγαλμα τῆς ὑπερπλούτου χλιδῆς. θαλασσόπλαγκτα δʼ οὔτις ἄλλος ἀντʼ ἐμοῦ λινόπτερʼ ηὗρε ναυτίλων ὀχήματα. τοιαῦτα μηχανήματʼ ἐξευρὼν τάλας
for mankind, yet have myself no cunning means to rid me of my present suffering.	βροτοῖσιν, αὐτὸς οὐκ ἔχω σόφισμʼ ὅτῳ τῆς νῦν παρούσης πημονῆς ἀπαλλαγῶ.
You have suffered sorrow and humiliation. You have lost your wits and have gone astray; and, like an unskilled doctor, fallen ill, you lose heart and cannot	πέπονθας αἰκὲς πῆμʼ· ἀποσφαλεὶς φρενῶν πλανᾷ, κακὸς δʼ ἰατρὸς ὥς τις ἐς νόσον πεσὼν ἀθυμεῖς καὶ σεαυτὸν οὐκ ἔχεις
discover by which remedies to cure your own disease.	εὑρεῖν ὁποίοις φαρμάκοις ἰάσιμος.
Hear the rest and you shall wonder the more at the arts and resources I devised. This first and foremost: if ever man fell ill, there was no defence—no healing food,	τὰ λοιπά μου κλύουσα θαυμάσῃ πλέον, οἵας τέχνας τε καὶ πόρους ἐμησάμην. τὸ μὲν μέγιστον, εἴ τις ἐς νόσον πέσοι, οὐκ ἦν ἀλέξημʼ οὐδέν, οὔτε βρώσιμον,
no ointment, nor any drink—but for lack of medicine they wasted away, until I showed them how to mix soothing remedies with which they now ward off all their disorders. And I marked out many ways by which they might read the future,	οὐ χριστόν, οὐδὲ πιστόν, ἀλλὰ φαρμάκων χρείᾳ κατεσκέλλοντο, πρίν γʼ ἐγώ σφισιν ἔδειξα κράσεις ἠπίων ἀκεσμάτων, αἷς τὰς ἁπάσας ἐξαμύνονται νόσους. τρόπους τε πολλοὺς μαντικῆς ἐστοίχισα,
and among dreams I first discerned which are destined to come true; and voices baffling interpretation I explained to them, and signs from chance meetings. The flight of crook-taloned birds I distinguished clearly— which by nature are auspicious,	κἄκρινα πρῶτος ἐξ ὀνειράτων ἃ χρὴ ὕπαρ γενέσθαι, κληδόνας τε δυσκρίτους ἐγνώρισʼ αὐτοῖς ἐνοδίους τε συμβόλους· γαμψωνύχων τε πτῆσιν οἰωνῶν σκεθρῶς διώρισʼ, οἵτινές τε δεξιοὶ φύσιν
which sinister—their various modes of life, their mutual feuds and loves, and their consortings; and the smoothness of their entrails, and what color the gall must have to please	εὐωνύμους τε, καὶ δίαιταν ἥντινα ἔχουσʼ ἕκαστοι, καὶ πρὸς ἀλλήλους τίνες ἔχθραι τε καὶ στέργηθρα καὶ συνεδρίαι· σπλάγχνων τε λειότητα, καὶ χροιὰν τίνα ἔχουσʼ ἂν εἴη δαίμοσιν πρὸς ἡδονὴν
the gods, also the speckled symmetry of the liver-lobe; and the thigh-bones, wrapped in fat, and the long chine I burned and initiated mankind into an occult art. Also I cleared their vision to discern signs from flames,which were obscure before this.	χολή, λοβοῦ τε ποικίλην εὐμορφίαν. κνίσῃ τε κῶλα συγκαλυπτὰ καὶ μακρὰν ὀσφῦν πυρώσας δυστέκμαρτον ἐς τέχνην ὥδωσα θνητούς, καὶ φλογωπὰ σήματα ἐξωμμάτωσα, πρόσθεν ὄντʼ ἐπάργεμα.
Enough about these arts. Now as to the benefits to men that lay concealed beneath the earth—bronze, iron, silver, and gold—who would claim to have discovered them before me? No one, I know full well, unless he likes to babble idly.	τοιαῦτα μὲν δὴ ταῦτʼ· ἔνερθε δὲ χθονὸς κεκρυμμένʼ, ἀνθρώποισιν ὠφελήματα, χαλκόν, σίδηρον, ἄργυρον, χρυσόν τε τίς φήσειεν ἂν πάροιθεν ἐξευρεῖν ἐμοῦ; οὐδείς, σάφʼ οἶδα, μὴ μάτην φλύσαι θέλων.
Hear the sum of the whole matter in the compass of one brief word—every art possessed by man comes from Prometheus.	βραχεῖ δὲ μύθῳ πάντα συλλήβδην μάθε, πᾶσαι τέχναι βροτοῖσιν ἐκ Προμηθέως.
Do not benefit mortals beyond reason and disregard your own distress; although, I am confident that you will be freed	μή νυν βροτοὺς μὲν ὠφέλει καιροῦ πέρα, σαυτοῦ δʼ ἀκήδει δυστυχοῦντος. ὡς ἐγὼ εὔελπίς εἰμι τῶνδέ σʼ ἐκ δεσμῶν ἔτι
from these bonds and will have power in no way inferior to Zeus.	λυθέντα μηδὲν μεῖον ἰσχύσειν Διός.
Not in this way is Fate, who brings all to fulfillment, destined to complete this course. Only when I have been bent by pangs and tortures infinite am I to escape my bondage. Skill is weaker by far than Necessity.	οὐ ταῦτα ταύτῃ Μοῖρά πω τελεσφόρος κρᾶναι πέπρωται, μυρίαις δὲ πημοναῖς δύαις τε καμφθεὶς ὧδε δεσμὰ φυγγάνω· τέχνη δʼ ἀνάγκης ἀσθενεστέρα μακρῷ.
Who then is the helmsman of Necessity?	τίς οὖν ἀνάγκης ἐστὶν οἰακοστρόφος;
The three-shaped Fates and mindful Furies.	Μοῖραι τρίμορφοι μνήμονές τʼ Ἐρινύες
Can it be that Zeus has less power than they do?	τούτων ἄρα Ζεύς ἐστιν ἀσθενέστερος;
Yes, in that even he cannot escape what is foretold.	οὔκουν ἂν ἐκφύγοι γε τὴν πεπρωμένην.
Why, what is fated for Zeus except to hold eternal sway?	τί γὰρ πέπρωται Ζηνὶ πλὴν ἀεὶ κρατεῖν;
This you must not learn yet; do not be over-eager.	τοῦτʼ οὐκέτʼ ἂν πύθοιο μηδὲ λιπάρει.
It is some solemn secret, surely, that you enshroud in mystery.	ἦ πού τι σεμνόν ἐστιν ὃ ξυναμπέχεις.
Think of some other subject, for it is not the proper time to speak of this. No matter what, this must be kept concealed; for it is by safeguarding it that	ἄλλου λόγου μέμνησθε, τόνδε δʼ οὐδαμῶς καιρὸς γεγωνεῖν, ἀλλὰ συγκαλυπτέος ὅσον μάλιστα· τόνδε γὰρ σῴζων ἐγὼ
I am to escape my dishonorable bonds and outrage.	δεσμοὺς ἀεικεῖς καὶ δύας ἐκφυγγάνω.
May Zeus, who apportions everything, never set his power in conflict with my will,	μηδάμʼ ὁ πάντα νέμων θεῖτʼ ἐμᾷ γνώμᾳ κράτος ἀντίπαλον Ζεύς,
nor may I be slow to approach the gods, with holy sacrifices of oxen slain, by the side of the ceaseless stream of Oceanus, my father;	μηδʼ ἐλινύσαιμι θεοὺς ὁσίαις θοίναις ποτινισομένα βουφόνοις παρʼ Ὠκεανοῦ πατρὸς ἄσβεστον πόρον,
and may I not offend in speech; but may this rule abide in my heart and never fade away.	μηδʼ ἀλίτοιμι λόγοις· ἀλλά μοι τόδʼ ἐμμένοι καὶ μήποτʼ ἐκτακείη·
Sweet it is to pass all the length of life amid confident hopes, feeding the heart in glad festivities. But I shudder	ἁδύ τι θαρσαλέαις τὸν μακρὸν τείνειν βίον ἐλπίσι, φαναῖς θυμὸν ἀλδαίνουσαν ἐν εὐφροσύναις. φρίσ-
as I look on you, racked by infinite tortures. You have no fear of Zeus, Prometheus, but in self-will you reverence mortals too much.	σω δέ σε δερκομένα μυρίοις μόχθοις διακναιόμενον . Ζῆνα γὰρ οὐ τρομέων ἰδίᾳ γνώμᾳ σέβῃ θνατοὺς ἄγαν, Προμηθεῦ.
Come, my friend, how mutual was your reciprocity? Tell me, what kind of help is there in creatures of a day? What aid? Did you not see the helpless infirmity, no better than a dream, in which the blind	φέρʼ, ὅπως ἄχαρις χάρις, ὦ φίλος· εἰπὲ ποῦ τίς ἀλκά; τίς ἐφαμερίων ἄρηξις; οὐδʼ ἐδέρχθης ὀλιγοδρανίαν ἄκικυν, ἰσόνειρον, ᾇ τὸ φωτῶν
generation of men is shackled? Never shall the counsels of mortal men transgress the ordering of Zeus.	ἀλαὸν γένος ἐμπεποδισμένον; οὔποτε τὰν Διὸς ἁρμονίαν θνατῶν παρεξίασι βουλαί.
I have learned this lesson from observing the luck, Prometheus, that has brought about your ruin. And the difference in the song stole into my thought	ἔμαθον τάδε σὰς προσιδοῦσʼ ὀλο- ὰς τύχας, Προμηθεῦ. τὸ διαμφίδιον δέ μοι μέλος προσέπτα
—this song and that, which, about your bridal bed and bath, I raised to grace your marriage, when you wooed with gifts	τόδʼ ἐκεῖνό θʼ, ὅ τʼ ἀμφὶ λουτρὰ καὶ λέχος σὸν ὑμεναίουν ἰότατι γάμων, ὅτε τὰν ὁμοπάτριον ἕδνοις
and won my sister Hesione to be your wedded wife.	ἄγαγες Ἡσιόναν πείθὼν δάμαρτα κοινόλεκτρον.
What land is this? What people? By what name am I to call the one I see exposed to the tempest in bonds of rock? What offence have you committed that as punishment you are doomed to destruction?	τίς γῆ; τί γένος; τίνα φῶ λεύσσειν τόνδε χαλινοῖς ἐν πετρίνοισιν χειμαζόμενον; τίνος ἀμπλακίας ποινὰς ὀλέκῃ;
Tell me to what region of the earth I have wandered in my wretchedness?	σήμηνον ὅποι γῆς ἡ μογερὰ πεπλάνημαι.
Oh, oh! Aah! Aah! A gad-fly, phantom of earth-born Argus is stinging me again! Keep him away, O Earth! I am fearful when I behold that myriad-eyed herdsman. He travels onward with his crafty gaze upon me;	ἆ ἆ, ἒ ἔ, χρίει τις αὖ με τὰν τάλαιναν οἶστρος, εἴδωλον Ἄργου γηγενοῦς, ἄλευʼ ἆ δᾶ· φοβοῦμαι τὸν μυριωπὸν εἰσορῶσα βούταν.
not even in death does the earth conceal him, but passing from the shades he hounds me, the forlorn one, and drives me famished along the sands of the seashore.	ὁ δὲ πορεύεται δόλιον ὄμμʼ ἔχων, ὃν οὐδὲ κατθανόντα γαῖα κεύθει. ἀλλʼ, ἐμὲ τὰν τάλαιναν ἐξ ἐνέρων περῶν κυναγετεῖ, πλανᾷ τε νῆστιν ἀνὰ τὰν παραλίαν ψάμμαν.
The waxen pipe drones forth in accompaniment a clear-sounding slumberous strain. Alas, alas! Where is my far-roaming wandering course taking me? In what, O son of Cronus, in what have you found offence so that you have bound me	ἀχέτας ὑπνοδόταν νόμον· ἰὼ ἰὼ πόποι, ποῖ μʼ ἄγουσι τη- λέπλαγκτοι πλάναι; τί ποτέ μʼ, ὦ Κρόνιε παῖ, τί ποτε ταῖσδʼ ἐνέζευξας εὑρὼν ἁμαρτοῦσαν ἐν
to this yoke of misery—aah! are you harassing a wretched maiden to frenzy by this terror of the pursuing gadfly? Consume me with fire, or hide me in the earth, or give me to the monsters of the deep to devour; but do not grudge, O Lord, the favor that I pray for.	πημοναῖσιν; ἓ ἕ, οἰστρηλάτῳ δὲ δείματι δειλαίαν παράκοπον ὧδε τείρεις; πυρί με φλέξον, ἢ χθονὶ κάλυψον, ἤ ποντίοις δάκεσι δὸς βοράν,
My far-roaming wanderings have taught me enough, and I cannot discern how to escape my sufferings. Do you hear the voice of the horned virgin?	μηδέ μοι φθονήσῃς εὐγμάτων, ἄναξ. ἄδην με πολύπλανοι πλάναι γεγυμνάκασιν, οὐδʼ ἔχω μαθεῖν ὅπα πημονὰς ἀλύξω. κλύεις φθέγμα τᾶς βούκερω παρθένου;
How can I fail to hear the maiden frenzied by the gadfly, the	πῶς δʼ οὐ κλύω τῆς οἰστροδινήτου κόρης,
daughter of Inachus? It is she who fires the heart of Zeus with passion, and now, through Hera’s hate, is disciplined by force with interminable wandering.	τῆς Ἰναχείας; ἣ Διὸς θάλπει κέαρ ἔρωτι, καὶ νῦν τοὺς ὑπερμήκεις δρόμους Ἥρᾳ στυγητὸς πρὸς βίαν γυμνάζεται.
Why do you call my father’s name? Tell me, the unfortunate maid, who you are,	πόθεν ἐμοῦ σὺ πατρὸς ὄνομʼ ἀπύεις; εἰπέ μοι τᾷ μογερᾷ τίς ὤν;
unhappy wretch, that you thus correctly address the miserable maiden, and have named the heaven-sent plague that wastes and stings me with its maddening goad. Ah me! In frenzied bounds I come,	τίς ἄρα μʼ, ὦ τάλας, τὰν τάλαιναν ὧδʼ ἔτυμα προσθροεῖς; θεόσυτόν τε νόσον ὠνόμασας, ἃ μαραίνει με χρίουσα κέντροις, ἰώ , φοιταλέοισιν ἓ ἕ·
driven by torturing hunger, victim of Hera’s vengeful purpose. Who of the company of the unfortunate endures—aah! aah!—sufferings such as mine? Oh make it clear to me	σκιρτημάτων δὲ νήστισιν αἰκείαις λαβρόσυτος ἦλθον, Ἥρας ἐπικότοισι μήδεσι δαμεῖσα. δυσ- δαιμόνων δὲ τίνες οἵ, ἓ ἕ, οἷʼ ἐγὼ μογοῦσιν; ἀλλά μοι τορῶς
what misery I am fated to suffer, what remedy is there, what cure, for my affliction. Reveal it, if you have the knowledge. Oh speak, declare it to the unfortunate, wandering virgin.	τέκμηρον ὅ τι μʼ ἐπαμμένει παθεῖν, τί μῆχαρ, ἢ τί φάρμακον νόσου, δεῖξον, εἴπερ οἶσθα· θρόει, φράζε τᾷ δυσπλάνῳ παρθένῳ.
I will tell you plainly all that you would like to know,	λέξω τορῶς σοι πᾶν ὅπερ χρῄζεις μαθεῖν,
not weaving riddles, but in simple language, since it is right to speak openly to friends. Look, I whom you see am Prometheus, who gave fire to mankind.	οὐκ ἐμπλέκων αἰνίγματʼ, ἀλλʼ ἁπλῷ λόγῳ, ὥσπερ δίκαιον πρὸς φίλους οἴγειν στόμα. πυρὸς βροτοῖς δοτῆρʼ ὁρᾷς Προμηθέα.
O you who have shown yourself a common benefactor of mankind, wretched Prometheus, why do you suffer so?	ὦ κοινὸν ὠφέλημα θνητοῖσιν φανείς, τλῆμον Προμηθεῦ, τοῦ δίκην πάσχεις τάδε;
I have only just now finished lamenting my own calamities.	ἁρμοῖ πέπαυμαι τοὺς ἐμοὺς θρηνῶν πόνους.
You will not then do this favor for me?	οὔκουν πόροις ἂν τήνδε δωρεὰν ἐμοί;
Say what it is you wish; for you can learn all from me.	λέγʼ ἥντινʼ αἰτῇ· πᾶν γὰρ ἂν πύθοιό μου.
Tell me who has bound you fast in this ravine.	σήμηνον ὅστις ἐν φάραγγί σʼ ὤχμασεν.
Zeus by his will, Hephaestus by his hand.	βούλευμα μὲν τὸ Δῖον, Ἡφαίστου δὲ χείρ.
And for what offence do you pay the penalty?	ποινὰς δὲ ποίων ἀμπλακημάτων τίνεις;
It suffices that I have made clear to you this much and no more.	τοσοῦτον ἀρκῶ σοι σαφηνίσας μόνον.
No, also tell me the end of my wandering—what time is set for wretched me.	καὶ πρός γε τούτοις τέρμα τῆς ἐμῆς πλάνης δεῖξον, τίς ἔσται τῇ ταλαιπώρῳ χρόνος.
It would be better not to know than to know, in your case.	τὸ μὴ μαθεῖν σοι κρεῖσσον ἢ μαθεῖν τάδε.
I beg you, do not hide from me what I am doomed to suffer.	μήτοι με κρύψῃς τοῦθʼ ὅπερ μέλλω παθεῖν.
No, it is not that I do not want to grant your request.	ἀλλʼ οὐ μεγαίρω τοῦδέ σοι δωρήματος.
Why then your reluctance to tell me everything?	τί δῆτα μέλλεις μὴ οὐ γεγωνίσκειν τὸ πᾶν;
I am not unwilling; but I hesitate to crush your spirit.	φθόνος μὲν οὐδείς, σὰς δʼ ὀκνῶ θράξαι φρένας.
Do not be more kind to me than I myself desire.	μή μου προκήδου μᾶσσον ὡς ἐμοὶ γλυκύ.
Since you insist, I must speak. Listen, then.	ἐπεὶ προθυμῇ, χρὴ λέγειν. ἄκουε δή.
No, not yet. Grant us too a portion of the pleasure. Let us first inquire the story of her affliction and let her with her own lips relate the events that brought horrid calamity upon her. Then let her be instructed by you as to the toils still to come.	μήπω γε· μοῖραν δʼ ἡδονῆς κἀμοὶ πόρε. τὴν τῆσδε πρῶτον ἱστορήσωμεν νόσον, αὐτῆς λεγούσης τὰς πολυφθόρους τύχας· τὰ λοιπὰ δʼ ἄθλων σοῦ διδαχθήτω πάρα.
It is for you, Io, to grant them this favor, especially since they are your father’s sisters. For it is worthwhile to indulge in weeping and in wailing over evil fortunes when one is likely to win the tribute of a tear from the listener.	σὸν ἔργον, Ἰοῖ, ταῖσδʼ ὑπουργῆσαι χάριν, ἄλλως τε πάντως καὶ κασιγνήταις πατρός. ὡς τἀποκλαῦσαι κἀποδύρασθαι τύχας ἐνταῦθʼ, ὅπου μέλλοι τις οἴσεσθαι δάκρυ πρὸς τῶν κλυόντων, ἀξίαν τριβὴν ἔχει.
I do not know how to refuse you. You shall learn in truthful speech all that you would like to know. Yet I am ashamed to tell about the storm of calamity sent by Heaven, of the marring of my form, and of the source from which it swooped upon me, wretched that I am.	οὐκ οἶδʼ ὅπως ὑμῖν ἀπιστῆσαί με χρή, σαφεῖ δὲ μύθῳ πᾶν ὅπερ προσχρῄζετε πεύσεσθε· καίτοι καὶ λέγουσʼ αἰσχύνομαι θεόσσυτον χειμῶνα καὶ διαφθορὰν μορφῆς, ὅθεν μοι σχετλίᾳ προσέπτατο.
For visions of the night, always haunting my maiden chamber, sought to beguile me with seductive words, saying: O damsel greatly blessed of fortune, why linger in your maidenhood so long when it is within your power to win a union of the highest? Zeus is inflamed by passion’s dart	αἰεὶ γὰρ ὄψεις ἔννυχοι πωλεύμεναι ἐς παρθενῶνας τοὺς ἐμοὺς παρηγόρουν λείοισι μύθοις ὦ μέγʼ εὔδαιμον κόρη, τί παρθενεύει δαρόν, ἐξόν σοι γάμου τυχεῖν μεγίστου; Ζεὺς γὰρ ἱμέρου βέλει
for you and is eager to unite with you in love. Do not, my child, spurn the bed of Zeus, but go forth to Lerna ’s meadow land of pastures deep and to your father’s flocks and where his cattle feed, so that the eye of Zeus may find respite from its longing.	πρὸς σοῦ τέθαλπται καὶ συναίρεσθαι Κύπριν θέλει· σὺ δʼ, ὦ παῖ, μὴ ʼπολακτίσῃς λέχος τὸ Ζηνός, ἀλλʼ ἔξελθε πρὸς Λέρνης βαθὺν λειμῶνα, ποίμνας βουστάσεις τε πρὸς πατρός, ὡς ἂν τὸ Δῖον ὄμμα λωφήσῃ πόθου.
By such dreams was I, to my distress, beset night after night, until at last I gained courage to tell my father of the dreams that haunted me. And he sent many a messenger to Pytho and Dodona so that he might discover	τοιοῖσδε πάσας εὐφρόνας ὀνείρασι συνειχόμην δύστηνος, ἔστε δὴ πατρὶ ἔτλην γεγωνεῖν νυκτίφοιτʼ ὀνείρατα. ὁ δʼ ἔς τε Πυθὼ κἀπὶ Δωδώνης πυκνοὺς θεοπρόπους ἴαλλεν, ὡς μάθοι τί χρὴ
what deed or word of his would find favor with the gods. But they returned with report of oracles, riddling, obscure, and darkly worded. Then at last there came an unmistakable utterance to Inachus, charging and commanding him clearly that	δρῶντʼ ἢ λέγοντα δαίμοσιν πράσσειν φίλα. ἧκον δʼ ἀναγγέλλοντες αἰολοστόμους χρησμοὺς ἀσήμους δυσκρίτως τʼ εἰρημένους. τέλος δʼ ἐναργὴς βάξις ἦλθεν Ἰνάχῳ σαφῶς ἐπισκήπτουσα καὶ μυθουμένη
he must thrust me forth from home and native land to roam at large to the remotest confines of the earth; and, if he would not, a fiery thunderbolt would come from Zeus that would utterly destroy his whole race. Yielding obedience to such prophetic utterances of Loxias,	ἔξω δόμων τε καὶ πάτρας ὠθεῖν ἐμέ, ἄφετον ἀλᾶσθαι γῆς ἐπʼ ἐσχάτοις ὅροις· κεἰ μὴ θέλοι, πυρωπὸν ἐκ Διὸς μολεῖν κεραυνόν, ὃς πᾶν ἐξαϊστώσοι γένος. τοιοῖσδε πεισθεὶς Λοξίου μαντεύμασιν
he drove me away and barred me from his house, against his will and mine; but the constraint of Zeus forced him to act by necessity. Immediately my form and mind were distorted, and with horns, as you see, upon my forehead,	ἐξήλασέν με κἀπέκλῃσε δωμάτων ἄκουσαν ἄκων· ἀλλʼ ἐπηνάγκαζέ νιν Διὸς χαλινὸς πρὸς βίαν πράσσειν τάδε. εὐθὺς δὲ μορφὴ καὶ φρένες διάστροφοι ἦσαν, κεραστὶς δʼ, ὡς ὁρᾶτʼ, ὀξυστόμῳ
stung by a sharp-fanged gadfly I rushed with frantic bounds to Cerchnea’s sweet stream and Lerna ’s spring. But Argus, the earth-born herdsman, untempered in his rage, pursued me, peering with his many eyes upon my steps.	μύωπι χρισθεῖσʼ ἐμμανεῖ σκιρτήματι ᾖσσον πρὸς εὔποτόν τε Κερχνείας ῥέος Λέρνης τε κρήνην · βουκόλος δὲ γηγενὴς ἄκρατος ὀργὴν Ἄργος ὡμάρτει, πυκνοῖς ὄσσοις δεδορκὼς τοὺς ἐμοὺς κατὰ στίβους.
A sudden death robbed him of life unexpectedly; while I, still tormented by the gadfly, am driven on from land to land before the heaven-sent plague. That is what happened ; and if you can declare what toils still remain, reveal them. Do not, from pity, seek	ἀπροσδόκητος δʼ αὐτὸν ἀφνίδιος μόρος τοῦ ζῆν ἀπεστέρησεν. οἰστροπλὴξ δʼ ἐγὼ μάστιγι θείᾳ γῆν πρὸ γῆς ἐλαύνομαι. κλύεις τὰ πραχθέντʼ· εἰ δʼ ἔχεις εἰπεῖν ὅ τι λοιπὸν πόνων, σήμαινε· μηδέ μʼ οἰκτίσας
to soothe me with untrue words ; for I consider false words to be the foulest sickness.	ξύνθαλπε μύθοις ψευδέσιν· νόσημα γὰρ αἴσχιστον εἶναί φημι συνθέτους λόγους.
Oh, ah, go away, alas! Never, oh never, did I dream that words so strange would greet my ears;	ἔα ἔα, ἄπεχε, φεῦ· οὔποτʼ οὔποτʼ ηὔχουν ὧδε ξένους μολεῖσθαι λόγους εἰς ἀκοὰν ἐμάν,
or that sufferings so grievous to look upon, yes, and so grievous to endure, a tale of outrage, would strike my soul as if with double-pronged goad. Alas, O Fate, O Fate,	οὐδʼ ὧδε δυσθέατα καὶ δύσοιστα πήματα, λύματα, ἀμ- φάκει κέντρῳ τύψειν ψυχὰν ἐμάν. ἰὼ μοῖρα μοῖρα,
I shudder to behold the plight that has befallen Io.	πέφρικʼ εἰσιδοῦσα πρᾶξιν Ἰοῦς.
You lament and are full of fear all too soon. Wait until you have learned the rest as well.	πρῴ γε στενάζεις καὶ φόβου πλέα τις εἶ· ἐπίσχες ἔστʼ ἂν καὶ τὰ λοιπὰ προσμάθῃς.
Proceed, tell all. It is comforting for the sick to know clearly beforehand what pain still awaits them.	λέγʼ, ἐκδίδασκε· τοῖς νοσοῦσί τοι γλυκὺ τὸ λοιπὸν ἄλγος προυξεπίστασθαι τορῶς.
You gained your former request easily from me; for you first desired the story of her ordeal from her own lips. Hear now the sequel, the sufferings this maid is fated to endure at Hera’s hand.	τὴν πρίν γε χρείαν ἠνύσασθʼ ἐμοῦ πάρα κούφως· μαθεῖν γὰρ τῆσδε πρῶτʼ ἐχρῄζετε τὸν ἀμφʼ ἑαυτῆς ἆθλον ἐξηγουμένης· τὰ λοιπὰ νῦν ἀκούσαθʼ, οἷα χρὴ πάθη τλῆναι πρὸς Ἥρας τήνδε τὴν νεάνιδα.
And may you, daughter of Inachus, lay to heart my words so that you may learn the end of your wanderings. First, from this spot, turn yourself toward the rising sun and make your way over untilled plains; and you shall reach the Scythian nomads, who dwell	σύ τʼ Ἰνάχειον σπέρμα, τοὺς ἐμοὺς λόγους θυμῷ βάλʼ, ὡς ἂν τέρματʼ ἐκμάθῃς ὁδοῦ. πρῶτον μὲν ἐνθένδʼ ἡλίου πρὸς ἀντολὰς στρέψασα σαυτὴν στεῖχʼ ἀνηρότους γύας· Σκύθας δʼ ἀφίξῃ νομάδας, οἳ πλεκτὰς στέγας
in thatched houses, perched aloft on strong-wheeled wagons and are equipped with far-darting bows. Do not approach them, but keeping your feet near the rugged shore, where the sea breaks with a roar, pass on beyond their land. On the left hand dwell the workers in iron,	πεδάρσιοι ναίουσʼ ἐπʼ εὐκύκλοις ὄχοις ἑκηβόλοις τόξοισιν ἐξηρτυμένοι· οἷς μὴ πελάζειν, ἀλλʼ ἁλιστόνοις πόδας χρίμπτουσα ῥαχίαισιν ἐκπερᾶν χθόνα. λαιᾶς δὲ χειρὸς οἱ σιδηροτέκτονες
the Chalybes, and you must beware of them, since they are savage and are not to be approached by strangers. Then you shall reach the river Hybristes, which does not belie its name. Do not cross this, for it is hard to cross, until you come to Caucasus itself,	οἰκοῦσι Χάλυβες, οὓς φυλάξασθαί σε χρή. ἀνήμεροι γὰρ οὐδὲ πρόσπλατοι ξένοις. ἥξεις δʼ Ὑβριστὴν ποταμὸν οὐ ψευδώνυμον, ὃν μὴ περάσῃς, οὐ γὰρ εὔβατος περᾶν, πρὶν ἂν πρὸς αὐτὸν Καύκασον μόλῃς, ὀρῶν
loftiest of mountains, where from its very brows the river pours out its might in fury. You must pass over its crests, which neighbor the stars, and enter upon a southward course, where you shall reach the host of the Amazons, who loathe all men. They shall in time to come	ὕψιστον, ἔνθα ποταμὸς ἐκφυσᾷ μένος κροτάφων ἀπʼ αὐτῶν. ἀστρογείτονας δὲ χρὴ κορυφὰς ὑπερβάλλουσαν ἐς μεσημβρινὴν βῆναι κέλευθον, ἔνθʼ, Ἀμαζόνων στρατὸν ἥξεις στυγάνορʼ, αἳ Θεμίσκυράν ποτε
inhabit Themiscyra on the Thermodon, where, fronting the sea, is Salmydessus’ rugged jaw, evil host of mariners, step-mother of ships. The Amazons will gladly guide you on your way. Next, just at the narrow portals of the harbor, you shall reach	κατοικιοῦσιν ἀμφὶ Θερμώδονθʼ, ἵνα τραχεῖα πόντου Σαλμυδησσία γνάθος ἐχθρόξενος ναύταισι, μητρυιὰ νεῶν· αὗταί σʼ ὁδηγήσουσι καὶ μάλʼ ἀσμένως. ἰσθμὸν δʼ ἐπʼ αὐταῖς στενοπόροις λίμνης πύλαις
the Cimmerian isthmus. This you must leave with stout heart and pass through the channel of Maeotis; and ever after among mankind there shall be great mention of your passing, and it shall be called after you the Bosporus . Then, leaving the soil of Europe ,	Κιμμερικὸν ἥξεις, ὃν θρασυσπλάγχνως σε χρὴ λιποῦσαν αὐλῶνʼ ἐκπερᾶν Μαιωτικόν· ἔσται δὲ θνητοῖς εἰσαεὶ λόγος μέγας τῆς σῆς πορείας, Βόσπορος δʼ ἐπώνυμος κεκλήσεται. λιποῦσα δʼ Εὐρώπης πέδον
you shall come to the Asian continent. Does it not seem to you that the tyrant of the gods is violent in all his ways? For this god, desirous of union with this mortal maid, has imposed upon her these wanderings. Maiden, you have gained a cruel suitor	ἤπειρον ἥξεις Ἀσιάδʼ·. ἆρʼ, ὑμῖν δοκεῖ ὁ τῶν θεῶν τύραννος ἐς τὰ πάνθʼ ὁμῶς βίαιος εἶναι; τῇδε γὰρ θνητῇ θεὸς χρῄζων μιγῆναι τάσδʼ ἐπέρριψεν πλάνας. πικροῦ δʼ ἔκυρσας, ὦ κόρη, τῶν σῶν γάμων
for your hand. As to the tale you now have heard— understand that it has not even passed the introduction.	μνηστῆρος. οὓς γὰρ νῦν ἀκήκοας λόγους, εἶναι δόκει σοι μηδέπω ʼν προοιμίοις.
Ah me, ah me, alas!	ἰώ μοί μοι, ἒ ἔ.
What! You are crying and groaning again? What will you do, I wonder, when you have learned the sufferings still in store for you?	σὺ δʼ αὖ κέκραγας κἀναμυχθίζῃ; τί που δράσεις, ὅταν τὰ λοιπὰ πυνθάνῃ κακά;
What! Can it be that you have sufferings still left to recount to her?	ἦ γάρ τι λοιπὸν τῇδε πημάτων ἐρεῖς;
Yes, a tempestuous sea of calamitous distress.	δυσχείμερόν γε πέλαγος ἀτηρᾶς δύης.
What gain have I then in life? Why did I not hurl myself straightaway from this rugged rock, so that I was dashed to earth and freed from	τί δῆτʼ ἐμοὶ ζῆν κέρδος, ἀλλʼ οὐκ ἐν τάχει ἔρριψʼ ἐμαυτὴν τῆσδʼ ἀπὸ στύφλου πέτρας, ὅπως πέδοι σκήψασα τῶν πάντων πόνων
all my sufferings? It is better to die once and for all than linger out all my days in misery.	ἀπηλλάγην; κρεῖσσον γὰρ εἰσάπαξ θανεῖν ἢ τὰς ἁπάσας ἡμέρας πάσχειν κακῶς.
Ah, you would hardly bear my agonies to whom it is not foredoomed to die; for death would have freed me from my sufferings.	ἦ δυσπετῶς ἂν τοὺς ἐμοὺς ἄθλους φέροις, ὅτῳ θανεῖν μέν ἐστιν οὐ πεπρωμένον· αὕτη γὰρ ἦν ἂν πημάτων ἀπαλλαγή·
But now no limit to my tribulations has been appointed until Zeus is hurled from his sovereignty.	νῦν δʼ οὐδέν ἐστι τέρμα μοι προκείμενον μόχθων, πρὶν ἂν Ζεὺς ἐκπέσῃ τυραννίδος.
What! Shall Zeus one day be hurled from his dominion?	ἦ γάρ ποτʼ ἔστιν ἐκπεσεῖν ἀρχῆς Δία;
You would rejoice, I think, to see that happen.	ἥδοιʼ ἄν, οἶμαι, τήνδʼ ἰδοῦσα συμφοράν.
Why not, since it is at the hand of Zeus that I suffer?	πῶς δʼ οὐκ ἄν, ἥτις ἐκ Διὸς πάσχω κακῶς;
Then you may assure yourself that these things are true.	ὡς τοίνυν ὄντων τῶνδέ σοι μαθεῖν πάρα.
By whom shall he be despoiled of the sceptre of his sovereignty?	πρὸς τοῦ τύραννα σκῆπτρα συληθήσεται;
By himself and his own empty-headed purposes.	πρὸς αὐτὸς αὑτοῦ κενοφρόνων βουλευμάτων.
In what way? Oh tell me, if there be no harm in telling.	ποίῳ τρόπῳ; σήμηνον, εἰ μή τις βλάβη.
He shall make a marriage that shall one day cause him distress.	γαμεῖ γάμον τοιοῦτον ᾧ ποτʼ ἀσχαλᾷ.
With a divinity or with a mortal? If it may be told, speak out.	θέορτον, ἢ βρότειον; εἰ ῥητόν, φράσον.
Why ask with whom? I may not speak of this.	τί δʼ ὅντινʼ·; οὐ γὰρ ῥητὸν αὐδᾶσθαι τόδε.
Is it by his consort that he shall be dethroned?	ἦ πρὸς δάμαρτος ἐξανίσταται θρόνων;
Yes, since she shall bear a son mightier than his father.	ἣ τέξεταί γε παῖδα φέρτερον πατρός.
And has he no means to avert this doom?	οὐδʼ ἔστιν αὐτῷ τῆσδʼ ἀποστροφὴ τύχης;
No, none—except me, if I were released from bondage.	οὐ δῆτα, πλὴν ἔγωγʼ ἂν ἐκ δεσμῶν λυθείς.
Who then is to release you against the will of Zeus?	τίς οὖν ὁ λύσων ἐστὶν ἄκοντος Διός;
It is to be one of your own grandchildren.	τῶν σῶν τινʼ αὐτὸν ἐγγόνων εἶναι χρεών.
What did you say? A child of mine will release you from your misery?	πῶς εἶπας; ἦ ʼμὸς παῖς σʼ ἀπαλλάξει κακῶν;
The third in descent after ten generations.	τρίτος γε γένναν πρὸς δέκʼ ἄλλαισιν γοναῖς.
Your prophecy is not easy to understand.	ἥδʼ οὐκέτʼ εὐξύμβλητος ἡ χρησμῳδία.
Yes, so do not seek to learn the full extent of your own sufferings.	καὶ μηδὲ σαυτῆς ἐκμαθεῖν ζήτει πόνους.
Do not offer me a favor and then withdraw it.	μή μοι προτείνων κέρδος εἶτʼ ἀποστέρει.
I will present you with one or other of two tales.	δυοῖν λόγοιν σε θατέρῳ δωρήσομαι.
Which two? Set them forth and offer me the choice.	ποίοιν; πρόδειξον, αἵρεσίν τʼ ἐμοὶ δίδου.
I am making the offer: choose whether I shall reveal the sufferings still in store for you or the one who will be my deliverer.	δίδωμʼ· ἑλοῦ γάρ, ἢ πόνων τὰ λοιπά σοι φράσω σαφηνῶς, ἢ τὸν ἐκλύσοντʼ ἐμέ.
Consent to bestow on her one of these favors, and on me the other; do not deny me the tale. Tell her about her further wanderings;	τούτων σὺ τὴν μὲν τῇδε, τὴν δʼ ἐμοὶ χάριν θέσθαι θέλησον, μηδʼ ἀτιμάσῃς λόγου· καὶ τῇδε μὲν γέγωνε τὴν λοιπὴν πλάνην,
tell me who will deliver you—for I would like to know this.	ἐμοὶ δὲ τὸν λύσοντα· τοῦτο γὰρ ποθῶ.
Well, since you are bent on this, I will not refuse to proclaim all that you still crave to know. First, to you, Io, will I declare your much-vexed wandering, and may you engrave it on the recording tablets of your mind.	ἐπεὶ προθυμεῖσθʼ, οὐκ ἐναντιώσομαι τὸ μὴ οὐ γεγωνεῖν πᾶν ὅσον προσχρῄζετε. σοὶ πρῶτον, Ἰοῖ, πολύδονον πλάνην φράσω, ἣν ἐγγράφου σὺ μνήμοσιν δέλτοις φρενῶν.
When you have crossed the stream that bounds the two continents, toward the flaming east, where the sun walks,...... crossing the surging sea until you reach the Gorgonean plains of Cisthene, where the daughters of Phorcys dwell, ancient maids,	ὅταν περάσῃς ῥεῖθρον ἠπείροιν ὅρον, πρὸς ἀντολὰς φλογῶπας ἡλιοστιβεῖς πόντου περῶσα φλοῖσβον, ἔστʼ ἂν ἐξίκῃ πρὸς Γοργόνεια πεδία Κισθήνης, ἵνα
three in number, shaped like swans, possessing one eye amongst them and a single tooth; neither does the sun with his beams look down upon them, nor ever the nightly moon. And near them are their three winged sisters, the snake-haired Gorgons, loathed of mankind,	αἱ Φορκίδες ναίουσι δηναιαὶ κόραι τρεῖς κυκνόμορφοι, κοινὸν ὄμμʼ ἐκτημέναι, μονόδοντες, ἃς οὔθʼ ἥλιος προσδέρκεται ἀκτῖσιν οὔθʼ ἡ νύκτερος μήνη ποτέ. πέλας δʼ ἀδελφαὶ τῶνδε τρεῖς κατάπτεροι, δρακοντόμαλλοι Γοργόνες βροτοστυγεῖς,
whom no one of mortal kind shall look upon and still draw breath. Such is the peril that I bid you to guard against. But now listen to another and a fearsome spectacle. Beware of the sharp-beaked hounds of Zeus that do not bark, the gryphons,	ἃς θνητὸς οὐδεὶς εἰσιδὼν ἕξει πνοάς. τοιοῦτο μέν σοι τοῦτο φρούριον λέγω· ἄλλην δʼ ἄκουσον δυσχερῆ θεωρίαν· ὀξυστόμους γὰρ Ζηνὸς ἀκραγεῖς κύνας γρῦπας φύλαξαι, τόν τε μουνῶπα στρατὸν
and the one-eyed Arimaspian folk, mounted on horses, who dwell about the flood of Pluto’s stream that flows with gold. Do not approach them. Then you shall come to a far-off country of a dark race that dwells by the waters of the sun, where the river Aethiop is.	Ἀριμασπὸν ἱπποβάμονʼ, οἳ χρυσόρρυτον οἰκοῦσιν ἀμφὶ νᾶμα Πλούτωνος πόρου· τούτοις σὺ μὴ πέλαζε. τηλουρὸν δὲ γῆν ἥξεις, κελαινὸν φῦλον, οἳ πρὸς ἡλίου ναίουσι πηγαῖς, ἔνθα ποταμὸς Αἰθίοψ.
Follow along its banks until you reach the cataract, where, from the Bybline mountains, Nile sends forth his hallowed and sweet stream. He will conduct you on your way to the three-angled land of Nilotis, where, at last, it is ordained for you,	τούτου παρʼ ὄχθας ἕρφʼ, ἕως ἂν ἐξίκῃ καταβασμόν, ἔνθα Βιβλίνων ὀρῶν ἄπο ἵησι σεπτὸν Νεῖλος εὔποτον ῥέος. οὗτός σʼ ὁδώσει τὴν τρίγωνον ἐς χθόνα Νειλῶτιν, οὗ δὴ τὴν μακρὰν ἀποικίαν,
O Io, and for your children to found your far-off colony. If anything of this is confusing to you and hard to understand, may you question me yet again, and gain a clear account; for I have more leisure than I crave.	Ἰοῖ, πέπρωται σοί τε καὶ τέκνοις κτίσαι. τῶν δʼ εἴ τί σοι ψελλόν τε καὶ δυσεύρετον, ἐπανδίπλαζε καὶ σαφῶς ἐκμάνθανε· σχολὴ δὲ πλείων ἢ θέλω πάρεστί μοι.
If there is anything still remaining or passed over	εἰ μέν τι τῇδε λοιπὸν ἢ παρειμένον
of her direful wandering that you have to tell, oh speak. But if you have told all, grant us in turn the favor we request—you probably have it still in memory.	ἔχεις γεγωνεῖν τῆς πολυφθόρου πλάνης, λέγʼ· εἰ δὲ πάντʼ εἴρηκας, ἡμῖν αὖ χάριν δὸς ἥνπερ αἰτούμεσθα, μέμνησαι δέ που.
She has now heard the full end of her travels; yet so she may know that she has heard no vain tale from me,	τὸ πᾶν πορείας ἥδε τέρμʼ ἀκήκοεν. ὅπως δʼ ἂν εἰδῇ μὴ μάτην κλύουσά μου,
I will describe the toils she has endured before she came here, giving this as a sure proof of my account. Most of the weary tale I shall leave out and come to the very close of your wanderings. For when you reached the Molossian plains	ἃ πρὶν μολεῖν δεῦρʼ ἐκμεμόχθηκεν φράσω, τεκμήριον τοῦτʼ αὐτὸ δοὺς μύθων ἐμῶν. ὄχλον μὲν οὖν τὸν πλεῖστον ἐκλείψω λόγων, πρὸς αὐτὸ δʼ εἶμι τέρμα σῶν πλανημάτων. ἐπεὶ γὰρ ἦλθες πρὸς Μολοσσὰ γάπεδα,
and the sheer ridge that encircles Dodona , where lies the prophetic seat of Thesprotian Zeus and that marvel, passing all belief, the talking oaks, by which you clearly, and in no riddling terms, were saluted as the renowned	τὴν αἰπύνωτόν τʼ ἀμφὶ Δωδώνην, ἵνα μαντεῖα θᾶκός τʼ ἐστὶ Θεσπρωτοῦ Διός, τέρας τʼ ἄπιστον, αἱ προσήγοροι δρύες, ὑφʼ ὧν σὺ λαμπρῶς κοὐδὲν αἰνικτηρίως προσηγορεύθης ἡ Διὸς κλεινὴ δάμαρ
bride-to-be of Zeus (is any of this pleasing to you?), then, stung by the gadfly, you rushed along the pathway by the shore to the great gulf of Rhea, from where you are tossed in backward-wandering course; and for all time to come a recess of the sea,	μέλλουσʼ ἔσεσθαι. τῶνδε προσσαίνει σέ τι ; ἐντεῦθεν οἰστρήσασα τὴν παρακτίαν κέλευθον ᾖξας πρὸς μέγαν κόλπον Ῥέας, ἀφʼ οὗ παλιμπλάγκτοισι χειμάζῃ δρόμοις· χρόνον δὲ τὸν μέλλοντα πόντιος μυχός,
be well assured, shall bear the name Ionian, as a memorial of your crossing for all mankind. These, then, are the tokens to you of my understanding, to show that it discerns more than has been made manifest. The rest I shall declare both to you and her,	σαφῶς ἐπίστασʼ, Ἰόνιος κεκλήσεται,. τῆς σῆς πορείας μνῆμα τοῖς πᾶσιν βροτοῖς. σημεῖά σοι τάδʼ ἐστὶ τῆς ἐμῆς φρενός, ὡς δέρκεται πλέον τι τοῦ πεφασμένου. τὰ λοιπὰ δʼ ὑμῖν τῇδέ τʼ ἐς κοινὸν φράσω,
returning to the track of my former tale.	ἐς ταὐτὸν ἐλθὼν τῶν πάλαι λόγων ἴχνος.
There is a city, Canobus , on the extremity of the land at the very mouth and silt-bar of the Nile . There at last Zeus restores you to your senses by the mere stroke and touch of his unterrifying hand.	ἔστιν πόλις Κάνωβος ἐσχάτη χθονός, Νείλου πρὸς αὐτῷ στόματι καὶ προσχώματι· ἐνταῦθα δή σε Ζεὺς τίθησιν ἔμφρονα ἐπαφῶν ἀταρβεῖ χειρὶ καὶ θιγὼν μόνον.
And you shall bring forth dark Epaphus, thus named from the manner of Zeus’ engendering; and he shall gather the fruit of all the land watered by the broad-flowing Nile . Fifth in descent from him, fifty maidens shall return to Argos , not of their own	ἐπώνυμον δὲ τῶν Διὸς γεννημάτων τέξεις κελαινὸν Ἔπαφον, ὃς καρπώσεται ὅσην πλατύρρους Νεῖλος ἀρδεύει χθόνα· πέμπτη δʼ ἀπʼ αὐτοῦ γέννα πεντηκοντάπαις πάλιν πρὸς Ἄργος οὐχ ἑκοῦσʼ ἐλεύσεται
free choice, but fleeing marriage with their cousin kin; while these, their hearts ablaze with passion, like falcons eagerly pursuing doves, shall come in pursuit of wedlock unlawful to pursue; but God shall grudge them enjoyment of their brides.	θηλύσπορος, φεύγουσα συγγενῆ γάμον ἀνεψιῶν· οἱ δʼ ἐπτοημένοι φρένας, κίρκοι πελειῶν οὐ μακρὰν λελειμμένοι, ἥξουσι θηρεύοντες οὐ θηρασίμους γάμους, φθόνον δὲ σωμάτων ἕξει θεός·
Pelasgian soil shall offer the maids a home, when, in the watches of the night, their husbands have been slain by a deed of daring wrought by the women’s murderous blows. For each bride shall take the life of her lord, dyeing a two-edged sword in his blood—in such ways may Love come upon my enemies!	Πελασγία δὲ δέξεται θηλυκτόνῳ Ἄρει, δαμέντων νυκτιφρουρήτῳ θράσει. γυνὴ γὰρ ἄνδρʼ ἕκαστον αἰῶνος στερεῖ, δίθηκτον ἐν σφαγαῖσι βάψασα ξίφος· τοιάδʼ ἐπʼ ἐχθροὺς τοὺς ἐμοὺς ἔλθοι Κύπρις.
However, love’s desire shall charm one of the maidens not to slay her mate; rather, her resolve will lose its edge; for she will make her choice between two evil names to be called coward rather than murderess. She it is who shall give birth in Argos to a royal line—	μίαν δὲ παίδων ἵμερος θέλξει τὸ μὴ κτεῖναι σύνευνον, ἀλλʼ ἀπαμβλυνθήσεται γνώμην· δυοῖν δὲ θάτερον βουλήσεται, κλύειν ἄναλκις μᾶλλον ἢ μιαιφόνος· αὕτη κατʼ Ἄργος βασιλικὸν τέξει γένος.
a long story is necessary to explain this clearly; of her seed, however, shall be born a man of daring, renowned with the bow, who shall deliver me from these toils. Such is the oracle recounted to me by my mother, Titan Themis, born long ago.	μακροῦ λόγου δεῖ ταῦτʼ ἐπεξελθεῖν τορῶς. σπορᾶς γε μὴν ἐκ τῆσδε φύσεται θρασὺς τόξοισι κλεινός, ὃς πόνων ἐκ τῶνδʼ ἐμὲ λύσει. τοιόνδε χρησμὸν ἡ παλαιγενὴς μήτηρ ἐμοὶ διῆλθε Τιτανὶς Θέμις·
The manner and the means—these need lengthy speech to tell, and to learn them all would not be of any benefit.	ὅπως δὲ χὤπη, ταῦτα δεῖ μακροῦ λόγου εἰπεῖν, σύ τʼ οὐδὲν ἐκμαθοῦσα κερδανεῖς.
Oh! Oh! Alas! Once again convulsive pain and frenzy, striking my brain, inflame me. I am stung by the gadfly’s barb,	ἐλελεῦ ἐλελεῦ, ὑπό μʼ αὖ σφάκελος καὶ φρενοπληγεῖς μανίαι θάλπουσʼ, οἴστρου δʼ ἄρδις
unforged by fire. My heart knocks at my ribs in terror; my eyeballs roll wildly round and round. I am carried out of my course by a fierce blast of madness; I’ve lost all mastery over my tongue,	χρίει μʼ ἄπυρος· κραδία δὲ φόβῳ φρένα λακτίζει. τροχοδινεῖται δʼ ὄμμαθʼ ἑλίγδην, ἔξω δὲ δρόμου φέρομαι λύσσης πνεύματι μάργῳ, γλώσσης ἀκρατής·
and a stream of turbid words beats recklessly against the billows of dark destruction.	θολεροὶ δὲ λόγοι παίουσʼ εἰκῆ στυγνῆς πρὸς κύμασιν ἄτης.
Ah, sage, sage indeed, was he who first pondered this truth in his mind and with his tongue gave it utterance—	ἦ σοφὸς ἦ σοφὸς ὃς πρῶτος ἐν γνώμᾳ τόδʼ ἐβάστασε καὶ γλώσ- σᾳ διεμυθολόγησεν,
that to marry in one’s own class is far the best—a poor man should not desire to marry among those who are pampered by riches, or who are mighty in pride of birth.	ὡς τὸ κηδεῦσαι καθʼ ἑαυτὸν ἀριστεύει μακρῷ, καὶ μήτε τῶν πλούτῳ διαθρυπτομένων μήτε τῶν γέννᾳ μεγαλυνομένων ὄντα χερνήταν ἐραστεῦσαι γάμων.
Never, oh never,	μήποτε μήποτέ μʼ, ὦ
immortal Fates, may you see me the partner of the bed of Zeus, and may I be wedded to no bridegroom who descends to me from heaven. For I shudder when I behold the loveless maidenhood of Io, cruelly crushed like this	πότνιαι Μοῖραι, λεχέων Διὸς εὐνά- τειραν ἴδοισθε πέλουσαν· μηδὲ πλαθείην γαμέτᾳ τινὶ τῶν ἐξ οὐρανοῦ. ταρβῶ γὰρ ἀστεργάνορα παρθενίαν εἰσορῶσʼ Ἰοῦς ἀμαλαπτομέναν
by her toilsome wanderings sent by Hera.	δυσπλάνοις Ἥρας ἀλατείαις πόνων.
When marriage is on equal terms, in my opinion it is no cause for dread; so never may the love of the mightier gods cast on me its irresistible glance. That would indeed be a war that cannot be fought, a source of resourceless misery; and	ἐμοὶ δʼ ὅτε μὲν ὁμαλὸς ὁ γάμος, ἄφοβος· μηδὲ κρεισσόνων θεῶν ἔρως ἄφυκτον ὄμμα προσδράκοι με. ἀπόλεμος ὅδε γʼ ὁ πόλεμος, ἄπορα πόριμος·
I do not know what would be my fate, for I do not see how I could escape the designs of Zeus.	οὐδʼ ἔχω τίς ἂν γενοίμαν. τὰν Διὸς γὰρ οὐχ ὁρῶ μῆτιν ὅπα φύγοιμʼ ἄν.
Yes, truly, the day will come when Zeus, although stubborn of soul, shall be humbled, seeing that he plans a marriage that shall	ἦ μὴν ἔτι Ζεύς, καίπερ αὐθάδης φρενῶν, ἔσται ταπεινός, οἷον ἐξαρτύεται γάμον γαμεῖν, ὃς αὐτὸν ἐκ τυραννίδος
hurl him into oblivion from his sovereignty and throne; and then immediately the curse his father Cronus invoked as he fell from his ancient throne, shall be fulfilled to the uttermost. Deliverance from such ruin no one of the gods can show him clearly except me.	θρόνων τʼ ἄιστον ἐκβαλεῖ· πατρὸς δʼ ἀρὰ Κρόνου τότʼ ἤδη παντελῶς κρανθήσεται, ἣν ἐκπίτνων ἠρᾶτο δηναιῶν θρόνων. τοιῶνδε μόχθων ἐκτροπὴν οὐδεὶς θεῶν δύναιτʼ ἂν αὐτῷ πλὴν ἐμοῦ δεῖξαι σαφῶς.
I know the fact and the means. So let him sit there in his assurance, putting his trust in the crash reverberating on high and brandishing his fire-breathing bolt in his hands. For these shall not protect him from falling in ignominious and unendurable ruin.	ἐγὼ τάδʼ οἶδα χᾦ τρόπῳ. πρὸς ταῦτά νυν θαρσῶν καθήσθω τοῖς πεδαρσίοις κτύποις πιστός, τινάσσων τʼ ἐν χεροῖν πύρπνουν βέλος. οὐδὲν γὰρ αὐτῷ ταῦτʼ ἐπαρκέσει τὸ μὴ οὐ πεσεῖν ἀτίμως πτώματʼ οὐκ ἀνασχετά·
Such an adversary is he now preparing despite himself, a prodigy irresistible, even one who shall discover a flame mightier than the lightning and a deafening crash to outroar the thunder; a prodigy who shall shiver the trident,	τοῖον παλαιστὴν νῦν παρασκευάζεται ἐπʼ αὐτὸς αὑτῷ, δυσμαχώτατον τέρας· ὃς δὴ κεραυνοῦ κρείσσονʼ εὑρήσει φλόγα, βροντῆς θʼ ὑπερβάλλοντα καρτερὸν κτύπον· θαλασσίαν τε γῆς τινάκτειραν νόσον
Poseidon’s spear, that scourge of the sea and shaker of the land. Then, wrecked upon this evil, Zeus shall learn how different it is to be a sovereign and a slave.	τρίαιναν, αἰχμὴν τὴν Ποσειδῶνος, σκεδᾷ. πταίσας δὲ τῷδε πρὸς κακῷ μαθήσεται ὅσον τό τʼ ἄρχειν καὶ τὸ δουλεύειν δίχα.
Surely, it is only your own desire that you utter as a curse against Zeus.	σύ θην ἃ χρῄζεις, ταῦτʼ ἐπιγλωσσᾷ Διός.
I speak what shall be brought to pass and, moreover, my own desire.	ἅπερ τελεῖται, πρὸς δʼ ἃ βούλομαι λέγω.
Must we really look for one to gain mastery over Zeus?	καὶ προσδοκᾶν χρὴ δεσπόσειν Ζηνός τινα;
Yes, and he shall bear upon his neck pangs more galling than these of mine.	καὶ τῶνδέ γʼ, ἕξει δυσλοφωτέρους πόνους.
How is it that you are not afraid to utter such taunts?	πῶς δʼ οὐχὶ ταρβεῖς τοιάδʼ ἐκρίπτων ἔπη;
Why should I fear since I am fated not to die?	τί δʼ ἂν φοβοίμην ᾧ θανεῖν οὐ μόρσιμον;
But he might inflict on you an ordeal even more bitter than this.	ἀλλʼ ἆθλον ἄν σοι τοῦδʼ ἔτʼ ἀλγίω πόροι.
Let him, for all I care! I am prepared for anything.	ὁ δʼ οὖν ποιείτω· πάντα προσδοκητά μοι.
Wise are they who do homage to Necessity.	οἱ προσκυνοῦντες τὴν Ἀδράστειαν σοφοί.
Worship, adore, and fawn upon whoever is your lord. But for Zeus I care less than nothing. Let him do his will, let him hold his power	σέβου, προσεύχου, θῶπτε τὸν κρατοῦντʼ ἀεί. ἐμοὶ δʼ ἔλασσον Ζηνὸς ἢ μηδὲν μέλει. δράτω, κρατείτω τόνδε τὸν βραχὺν χρόνον,
for his little day— since he will not bear sway over the gods for long. But wait, for over there I see his messenger, the servant of our new lord and master. Certainly he has come to announce some news.	ὅπως θέλει· δαρὸν γὰρ οὐκ ἄρξει θεοῖς. ἀλλʼ εἰσορῶ γὰρ τόνδε τὸν Διὸς τρόχιν, τὸν τοῦ τυράννου τοῦ νέου διάκονον· πάντως τι καινὸν ἀγγελῶν ἐλήλυθεν.
To you, the clever and crafty, bitter beyond all bitterness,	σὲ τὸν σοφιστήν, τὸν πικρῶς ὑπέρπικρον,
who has sinned against the gods in bestowing honors upon creatures of a day—to you, thief of fire, I speak. The Father commands that you tell what marriage you boast of, whereby he is to be hurled from power—and this, mark well, set forth in no riddling fashion,	τὸν ἐξαμαρτόντʼ εἰς θεοὺς ἐφημέροις πορόντα τιμάς, τὸν πυρὸς κλέπτην λέγω· πατὴρ ἄνωγέ σʼ οὕστινας κομπεῖς γάμους αὐδᾶν, πρὸς ὧν ἐκεῖνος ἐκπίπτει κράτους. καὶ ταῦτα μέντοι μηδὲν αἰνικτηρίως,
but point by point, as the case exactly stands; and do not impose upon me a double journey, Prometheus—you see Zeus is not appeased by dealings such as yours.	ἀλλʼ αὔθʼ ἕκαστα φράζε· μηδέ μοι διπλᾶς ὁδούς, Προμηθεῦ, προσβάλῃς· ὁρᾷς δʼ ὅτι Ζεὺς τοῖς τοιούτοις οὐχὶ μαλθακίζεται.
Bravely spoken, in truth, and swollen with pride is your speech, as befits a minion of the gods.	σεμνόστομός γε καὶ φρονήματος πλέως ὁ μῦθός ἐστιν, ὡς θεῶν ὑπηρέτου.
Young you are, as young your power, and you think indeed that you inhabit heights beyond the reach of grief. Have I not seen two sovereigns cast out from these heights? A third, the present lord, I shall live to see cast out in ruin most shameful and most swift. Do you think	νέον νέοι κρατεῖτε καὶ δοκεῖτε δὴ ναίειν ἀπενθῆ πέργαμʼ· οὐκ ἐκ τῶνδʼ ἐγὼ δισσοὺς τυράννους ἐκπεσόντας ᾐσθόμην; τρίτον δὲ τὸν νῦν κοιρανοῦντʼ ἐπόψομαι αἴσχιστα καὶ τάχιστα. μή τί σοι δοκῶ
I quail, perhaps, and cower before these upstart gods? Far from it—no, not at all. But scurry back the way you came; for you shall learn nothing about which you question me.	ταρβεῖν ὑποπτήσσειν τε τε τοὺς νέους θεούς; πολλοῦ γε καὶ τοῦ παντὸς ἐλλείπω. σὺ δὲ κέλευθον ἥνπερ ἦλθες ἐγκόνει πάλιν· πεύσῃ γὰρ οὐδὲν ὧν ἀνιστορεῖς ἐμέ.
Yet it was by such proud wilfulness before, too,	τοιοῖσδε μέντοι καὶ πρὶν αὐθαδίσμασιν
that you brought yourself to this harbor of distress.	ἐς τάσδε σαυτὸν πημονὰς καθώρμισας.
For your servitude, rest assured, I’d not barter my hard lot, not I.	τῆς σῆς λατρείας τὴν ἐμὴν δυσπραξίαν, σαφῶς ἐπίστασʼ, οὐκ ἂν ἀλλάξαιμʼ ἐγώ.
Better, no doubt, to serve this rock than be the trusted messenger of Father Zeus!	κρεῖσσον γὰρ οἶμαι τῇδε λατρεύειν πέτρᾳ ἢ πατρὶ φῦναι Ζηνὶ πιστὸν ἄγγελον.
Such is the proper style for the insolent to offer insult.	οὕτως ὑβρίζειν τοὺς ὑβρίζοντας χρεών.
I think you revel in your present plight.	χλιδᾶν ἔοικας τοῖς παροῦσι πράγμασι.
I revel? Oh, I wish that I might see my enemies revelling in this way! And you, too, I count among them.	χλιδῶ; χλιδῶντας ὧδε τοὺς ἐμοὺς ἐγὼ ἐχθροὺς ἴδοιμι· καὶ σὲ δʼ ἐν τούτοις λέγω.
What! You blame me in some way for your calamities?	ἦ κἀμὲ γάρ τι συμφοραῖς ἐπαιτιᾷ;
In one word, I hate all the gods that received good at my hands and with ill requite me wrongfully.	ἁπλῷ λόγῳ τοὺς πάντας ἐχθαίρω θεούς, ὅσοι παθόντες εὖ κακοῦσί μʼ ἐκδίκως.
Your words declare you stricken with no slight madness.	κλύω σʼ ἐγὼ μεμηνότʼ οὐ σμικρὰν νόσον.
Mad I may be—if it is madness to loathe one’s enemies.	νοσοῖμʼ ἄν, εἰ νόσημα τοὺς ἐχθροὺς στυγεῖν.
You would be unbearable if you were prosperous.	εἴης φορητὸς οὐκ ἄν, εἰ πράσσοις καλῶς.
Alas! Alas ? That is a word unknown to Zeus.	ὤμοι. ὤμοι; τόδε Ζεὺς τοὔπος οὐκ ἐπίσταται.
But ever-ageing Time teaches all things.	ἀλλʼ ἐκδιδάσκει πάνθʼ ὁ γηράσκων χρόνος.
Yes, but you at least have not yet learned to keep a sober mind.	καὶ μὴν σύ γʼ οὔπω σωφρονεῖν ἐπίστασαι.
Or else I would not have addressed you, an underling.	σὲ γὰρ προσηύδων οὐκ ἂν ὄνθʼ ὑπηρέτην.
It seems you will answer nothing that the Father demands.	ἐρεῖν ἔοικας οὐδὲν ὧν χρῄζει πατήρ.
Yes, truly, I am his debtor and I should repay favor to him.	καὶ μὴν ὀφείλων γʼ ἂν τίνοιμʼ αὐτῷ χάριν.
You taunt me as though, indeed, I were a child.	ἐκερτόμησας δῆθεν ὡς παῖδʼ ὄντα με.
And are you not a child and even more witless than a child if you expect to learn anything from me? There is no torment or device by which	οὐ γὰρ σὺ παῖς τε κἄτι τοῦδʼ ἀνούστερος εἰ προσδοκᾷς ἐμοῦ τι πεύσεσθαι πάρα; οὐκ ἔστιν αἴκισμʼ οὐδὲ μηχάνημʼ ὅτῳ
Zeus shall induce me to utter this until these injurious fetters are loosed. So then, let his blazing lightning be hurled, and with the white wings of the snow and thunders of earthquake let him confound the reeling world.	προτρέψεταί με Ζεὺς γεγωνῆσαι τάδε, πρὶν ἂν χαλασθῇ δεσμὰ λυμαντήρια. πρὸς ταῦτα ῥιπτέσθω μὲν αἰθαλοῦσσα φλόξ, λευκοπτέρῳ δὲ νιφάδι καὶ βροντήμασι χθονίοις κυκάτω πάντα καὶ ταρασσέτω.
For nothing of this shall bend my will even to tell at whose hands he is fated to be hurled from his sovereignty.	γνάμψει γὰρ οὐδὲν τῶνδέ μʼ ὥστε καὶ φράσαι πρὸς οὗ χρεών νιν ἐκπεσεῖν τυραννίδος.
Look now whether this course seems to profit you.	ὅρα νυν εἴ σοι ταῦτʼ ἀρωγὰ φαίνεται.
Long ago has this my course been foreseen and resolved.	ὦπται πάλαι δὴ καὶ βεβούλευται τάδε.
Bend your will, perverse fool, oh bend your will at last	τόλμησον, ὦ μάταιε, τόλμησόν ποτε
to wisdom in face of your present sufferings.	πρὸς τὰς παρούσας πημονὰς ὀρθῶς φρονεῖν,
In vain you trouble me, as though it were a wave you try to persuade. Never think that, through terror at the will of Zeus, I shall become womanish and, with hands upturned, aping woman’s ways,	ὀχλεῖς μάτην με κῦμʼ ὅπως παρηγορῶν. εἰσελθέτω σε μήποθʼ ὡς ἐγὼ Διὸς γνώμην φοβηθεὶς θηλύνους γενήσομαι, καὶ λιπαρήσω τὸν μέγα στυγούμενον
shall importune my greatly hated enemy to release me from these bonds. I am far, far from that.	γυναικομίμοις ὑπτιάσμασιν χερῶν λῦσαί με δεσμῶν τῶνδε· τοῦ παντὸς δέω.
I think that by speaking much I will only speak in vain; for you are not soothed nor are you softened by my entreaties. You take the bit in your teeth like a new-harnessed	λέγων ἔοικα πολλὰ καὶ μάτην ἐρεῖν· τέγγῃ γὰρ οὐδὲν οὐδὲ μαλθάσσῃ λιταῖς ἐμαῖς· δακὼν δὲ στόμιον ὡς νεοζυγὴς
colt and struggle against the reins. Yet it is a paltry device that prompts your vehemence, for in the foolish-minded mere self-will of itself avails less than anything at all. But if you will not be won to belief by my words,	πῶλος βιάζῃ καὶ πρὸς ἡνίας μάχῃ. ἀτὰρ σφοδρύνῃ γʼ ἀσθενεῖ σοφίσματι· αὐθαδία γὰρ τῷ φρονοῦντι μὴ καλῶς αὐτὴ καθʼ αὑτὴν οὐδενὸς μεῖζον σθένει. σκέψαι δʼ, ἐὰν μὴ τοῖς ἐμοῖς πεισθῇς λόγοις,
think of what a tempest and a towering wave of woe shall break upon you past escape. First, the Father will shatter this jagged cliff with thunder and lightning-flame, and will entomb your frame, while the rock shall still hold you clasped in its embrace.	οἷός σε χειμὼν καὶ κακῶν τρικυμία ἔπεισʼ ἄφυκτος · πρῶτα μὲν γὰρ ὀκρίδα φάραγγα βροντῇ καὶ κεραυνίᾳ φλογὶ πατὴρ σπαράξει τήνδε, καὶ κρύψει δέμας τὸ σόν, πετραία δʼ ἀγκάλη σε βαστάσει.
But when you have completed a long stretch of time, you shall come back again to the light. Then indeed the winged hound of Zeus, the ravening eagle, coming an unbidden banqueter the whole day long, with savage appetite shall tear your body piecemeal into great rents and feast his fill	μακρὸν δὲ μῆκος ἐκτελευτήσας χρόνου ἄψορρον ἥξεις εἰς φάος· Διὸς δέ τοί πτηνὸς κύων, δαφοινὸς αἰετός, λάβρως διαρταμήσει σώματος μέγα ῥάκος, ἄκλητος ἕρπων δαιταλεὺς πανήμερος,
upon your liver until it is black with gnawing. Look for no term of this your agony until some god shall appear to take upon himself your woes and of his own free will descend into the sunless realm of Death and the dark deeps of Tartarus.	κελαινόβρωτον δʼ ἧπαρ ἐκθοινήσεται. τοιοῦδε μόχθου τέρμα μή τι προσδόκα, πρὶν ἂν θεῶν τις διάδοχος τῶν σῶν πόνων φανῇ, θελήσῃ τʼ εἰς ἀναύγητον μολεῖν Ἅιδην κνεφαῖά τʼ ἀμφὶ Ταρτάρου βάθη.
Therefore be advised, since this is no counterfeited vaunting but utter truth; for the mouth of Zeus does not know how to utter falsehood, but will bring to pass every word. May you consider warily and reflect, and never deem	πρὸς ταῦτα βούλευʼ· ὡς ὅδʼ οὐ πεπλασμένος ὁ κόμπος, ἀλλὰ καὶ λίαν εἰρημένος · ψευδηγορεῖν γὰρ οὐκ ἐπίσταται στόμα τὸ Δῖον, ἀλλὰ πᾶν ἔπος τελεῖ· σὺ δὲ πάπταινε καὶ φρόντιζε, μηδʼ αὐθαδίαν
stubbornness better than wise counsel.	εὐβουλίας ἀμείνονʼ ἡγήσῃ ποτέ.
To us, at least, Hermes seems not to speak untimely; for he bids you to lay aside your stubbornness and seek the good counsel of wisdom. Be advised! It is shameful for the wise to persist in error.	ἡμῖν μὲν Ἑρμῆς οὐκ ἄκαιρα φαίνεται λέγειν. ἄνωγε γάρ σε τὴν αὐθαδίαν μεθέντʼ ἐρευνᾶν τὴν σοφὴν εὐβουλίαν. πιθοῦ· σοφῷ γὰρ αἰσχρὸν ἐξαμαρτάνειν.
No news to me, in truth, is the message this fellow has proclaimed so noisily.Yet for enemy to suffer ill from enemy is no disgrace. Therefore let the lightning’s forked curl be cast upon my head and let the sky	εἰδότι τοί μοι τάσδʼ ἀγγελίας ὅδʼ ἐθώυξεν· πάσχειν δὲ κακῶς ἐχθρὸν ὑπʼ ἐχθρῶν οὐδὲν ἀεικές. πρὸς ταῦτʼ ἐπʼ ἐμοὶ ῥιπτέσθω μὲν πυρὸς ἀμφήκης βόστρυχος, αἰθὴρ δʼ
be convulsed with thunder and the wrack of savage winds; let the hurricane shake the earth from its rooted base, and let the waves of the sea mingle with their savage surge the courses	ἐρεθιζέσθω βροντῇ σφακέλῳ τʼ ἀγρίων ἀνέμων· χθόνα δʼ ἐκ πυθμένων αὐταῖς ῥίζαις πνεῦμα κραδαίνοι, κῦμα δὲ πόντου τραχεῖ ῥοθίῳ συγχώσειεν τῶν οὐρανίων
of the stars in heaven; and let him lift me on high and hurl me down to black Tartarus with the swirling floods of stern Necessity: do what he will, me he shall never bring to death.	ἄστρων διόδους· εἴς τε κελαινὸν Τάρταρον ἄρδην ῥίψειε δέμας τοὐμὸν ἀνάγκης στερραῖς δίναις· πάντως ἐμέ γʼ οὐ θανατώσει.
Such indeed are the thoughts and the words	τοιάδε μέντοι τῶν φρενοπλήκτων
one hears from men deranged. Where does his prayer fall short of raving? Where does he abate his frenzy?—But, at all events, may you who sympathize with his anguish,	βουλεύματʼ ἔπη τʼ ἔστιν ἀκοῦσαι. τί γὰρ ἐλλείπει μὴ οὐ παραπαίειν ἡ τοῦδʼ εὐχή; τί χαλᾷ μανιῶν; ἀλλʼ οὖν ὑμεῖς γʼ αἱ πημοσύναις συγκάμνουσαι ταῖς τοῦδε τόπων
withdraw in haste from this spot so that the relentless roar of the thunder does not stun your senses.	μετά ποι χωρεῖτʼ ἐκ τῶνδε θοῶς, μὴ φρένας ὑμῶν ἠλιθιώσῃ βροντῆς μύκημʼ ἀτέραμνον.
Use some other strain and urge me to some other course in which you are likely to convince me. This utterance	ἄλλο τι φώνει καὶ παραμυθοῦ μʼ ὅ τι καὶ πείσεις· οὐ γὰρ δή που
in your flood of speech is, I think, past all endurance. How do you charge me to practise baseness? With him I am content to suffer any fate; for I have learned to detest traitors, and there is no pest	τοῦτό γε τλητὸν παρέσυρας ἔπος. πῶς με κελεύεις κακότητʼ ἀσκεῖν; μετὰ τοῦδʼ ὅ τι χρὴ πάσχειν ἐθέλω· τοὺς προδότας γὰρ μισεῖν ἔμαθον, κοὐκ ἔστι νόσος
I abhor more than this.	τῆσδʼ ἥντινʼ ἀπέπτυσα μᾶλλον.
Well then, bear my warning in memory and do not blame your fortune when you are caught in the toils of calamity; nor ever say that it was Zeus who cast you	ἀλλʼ οὖν μέμνησθʼ ἁγὼ προλέγω μηδὲ πρὸς ἄτης θηραθεῖσαι μέμψησθε τύχην, μηδέ ποτʼ εἴπηθʼ ὡς Ζεὺς ὑμᾶς εἰς ἀπρόοπτον
into suffering unforeseen. Not so, but blame yourselves. For well forewarned, and not suddenly or secretly shall you be entangled in the inextricable net of calamity by reason of your folly.	πῆμʼ εἰσέβαλεν· μὴ δῆτʼ αὐταὶ δʼ ὑμᾶς αὐτάς. εἰδυῖαι γὰρ κοὐκ ἐξαίφνης οὐδὲ λαθραίως εἰς ἀπέρατον δίκτυον ἄτης ἐμπλεχθήσεσθʼ ὑπʼ ἀνοίας.
Indeed, now it has passed from word to deed—the earth rocks, the echoing thunder-peal from the depths rolls roaring past me; the fiery wreathed lightning-flashes flare forth, and whirlwinds toss the	καὶ μὴν ἔργῳ κοὐκέτι μύθῳ χθὼν σεσάλευται· βρυχία δʼ ἠχὼ παραμυκᾶται βροντῆς, ἕλικες δʼ ἐκλάμπουσι στεροπῆς ζάπυροι, στρόμβοι δὲ κόνιν
swirling dust; the blasts of all the winds leap forth and set in hostile array their embattled strife; the sky is confounded with the deep. Behold, this stormy turmoil advances against me visibly,	εἱλίσσουσι· σκιρτᾷ δʼ ἀνέμων πνεύματα πάντων εἰς ἄλληλα στάσιν ἀντίπνουν ἀποδεικνύμενα· ξυντετάρακται δʼ αἰθὴρ πόντῳ. τοιάδʼ ἐπʼ ἐμοὶ ῥιπὴ Διόθεν
sent by Zeus to frighten me. O holy mother mine, O you firmament that revolves the common light of all, you see the wrongs I suffer!	τεύχουσα φόβον στείχει φανερῶς. ὦ μητρὸς ἐμῆς σέβας, ὦ πάντων αἰθὴρ κοινὸν φάος εἱλίσσων, ἐσορᾷς μʼ ὡς ἔκδικα πάσχω.
