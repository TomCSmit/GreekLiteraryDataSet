By Mist, you certainly shall not stay here any longer!
But go and gnaw the columns of Megacles.
My good sir, what is the matter with you, O father?
You are not in your senses, by Olympian Jupiter!
See, see, Olympian Jupiter!
What folly!
To think of your believing in Jupiter, as old as you are!
Why, pray, did you laugh at this?
Reflecting that you are a child, and have antiquated notions.
Yet, however, approach, that you may know more; and I will tell you a thing, by learning which you will be a man.
But see that you do not teach this to any one.
Well, what is it?
You swore now by Jupiter.
I did.
Seest thou, then, how good a thing is learning?
There is no Jupiter, O Phidippides!
Who then?
Vortex reigns, having expelled Jupiter.
Bah!
Why do you talk foolishly?
Be assured that it is so.
Who says this?
Socrates the Melian, and Chaerephon, who knows the footmarks of fleas.
Have you arrived at such a pitch of frenzy that you believe madmen?
Speak words of good omen, and say nothing bad of clever men and wise; of whom, through frugality, none ever shaved or anointed himself, or went to a bath to wash himself; while you squander my property in bathing, as if I were already dead.
But go as quickly as possible and learn instead of me.
What good could any one learn from them?
What, really?
Whatever wisdom there is among men.
And you will know yourself, how ignorant and stupid you are.
But wait for me here a short time.
Ah me!
What shall I do, my father being crazed?
Shall I bring him into court and convict him of lunacy, or shall I give information of his madness to the coffin-makers?
Come, let me see; what do you consider this to be?
Tell me.
Alectryon.
Right.
And what this?
Alectryon.
Both the same?
You are very ridiculous.
Do not do so, then, for the future; but call this alektryaina, and this one alektor.
Alektryaina!
Did you learn these clever things by going in just now to the Titans?
