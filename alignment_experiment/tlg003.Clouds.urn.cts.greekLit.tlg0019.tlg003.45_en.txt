whether do you wish to take and lead away this your son, or shall I teach him to speak?
Teach him, and chastise him: and remember that you train him properly; on the one side able for petty suits; but train his other jaw able for the more important causes.
Make yourself easy; you shall receive him back a clever sophist.
Nay, rather, pale and wretched.
