For every one to whom I happen to be indebted, swears, and says he will ruin and destroy me, having made his deposits against me; though I only ask what is moderate and just- My good sir, one part don't take just now; the other part put off I pray; and the other part remit ; they say that thus they will never get back their money, but abuse me, as I am unjust, and say they will go to law with me.
Now therefore let them go to law, for it little concerns me, if Phidippides has learned to speak well.

Boy, boy!
Good morning, Strepsiades.

And tell me about my son, if he has learned that cause, which you just now brought forward.
He has learned it.
Well done, O Fraud, all-powerful queen!
So that you can get clear off from whatever suit you please.
Even if witnesses were present when I borrowed the money?
Yea, much more!
Even if a thousand be present.
