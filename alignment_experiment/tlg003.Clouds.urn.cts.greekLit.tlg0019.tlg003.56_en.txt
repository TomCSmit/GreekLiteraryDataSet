(running out of the house pursued by his son) Hollo!
Hollo!
O neighbours, and kinsfolk, and fellow-tribesmen, defend me, by all means, who am being beaten!
Ah me, unhappy man, for my head and jaw!
Wretch!
Do you beat your father?
Yes, father.
You see him owning that he beats me.
Certainly.
O wretch, and parricide, and house-breaker!
Say the same things of me again, and more.
Do you know that I take pleasure in being much abused?
You blackguard!
Sprinkle me with roses in abundance.
Do you beat your father?
And will prove too, by Jupiter!
that I beat you with justice.
O thou most rascally!
Why, how can it be just to beat a father?
I will demonstrate it, and will overcome you in argument.
Will you overcome me in this?
Yea, by much and easily.
But choose which of the two Causes you wish to speak.
Of what two Causes?
The better, or the worse?
Marry, I did get you taught to speak against justice, by Jupiter, my friend, if you are going to persuade me of this, that it is just and honourable for a father to be beaten by his sons!
I think I shall certainly persuade you; so that, when you have heard, not even you yourself will say anything against it.
Well, now, I am willing to hear what you have to say.
