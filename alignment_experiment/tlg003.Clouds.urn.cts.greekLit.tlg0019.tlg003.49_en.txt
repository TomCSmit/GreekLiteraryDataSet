Then I will shout with a very loud shout: Ho!
Weep, you petty-usurers, both you and your principals, and your compound interests!
For you can no longer do me any harm, because such a son is being reared for me in this house, shining with a double-edged tongue, for my guardian, the preserver of my house, a mischief to my enemies, ending the sadness of the great woes of his father.
Him do thou run and summon from within to me.
O child!
O son!
Come forth from the house!
Hear your father!
Lo, here is the man!
O my dear, my dear!
Take your son and depart.
