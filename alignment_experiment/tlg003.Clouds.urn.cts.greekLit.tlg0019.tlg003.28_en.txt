How, when engaged in a lawsuit, you could overturn the suit, when you were about to be cast, because you had no witnesses.
Most readily and easily.
Tell me, pray.
Well now, I'll tell you.
If, while one suit was still pending, before mine was called on, I were to run away and hang myself.
You talk nonsense.
By the gods, would I!
For no one will bring action against me when I am dead.
You talk nonsense.
Begone; I can't teach you any longer.
Why so?
Yea, by the gods, O Socrates!
You straightaway forget whatever you learn.
For what now was the first thing you were taught?
Tell me.
Come, let me see: nay, what was the first?
What was the fist?
Nay, what was the thing in which we knead our flour?
Ah me!
What was it?
Will you not pack off to the devil, you most forgetful and most stupid old man?
Ah me, what then, pray will become of me, wretched man?
For I shall be utterly undone, if I do not learn to ply the tongue.
Come, O ye Clouds, give me some good advice.
We, old man, advise you, if you have a son grown up, to send him to learn in your stead.
Well, I have a fine, handsome son, but he is not willing to learn.
What must I do?
But do you permit him?
Yes, for he is robust in body, and in good health, and is come of the high-plumed dames of Coesyra.
I will go for him, and if he be not willing, I will certainly drive him from my house.
Go in and wait for me a short time.
