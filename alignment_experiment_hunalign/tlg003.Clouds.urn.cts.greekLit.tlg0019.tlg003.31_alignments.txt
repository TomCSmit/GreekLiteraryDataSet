And many others too; but whatever I learned on each occasion I used to forget immediately, through length of years.	ἀλλʼ ὅ τι μάθοιμʼ ἑκάστοτε, ἐπελανθανόμην ἂν εὐθὺς ὑπὸ πλήθους ἐτῶν.	0.210309
Is it for this reason, pray, that you have also lost your cloak?	διὰ ταῦτα δὴ καὶ θοἰμάτιον ἀπώλεσας;	0.215094
I have not lost it; but have studied it away.	ἀλλʼ οὐκ ἀπολώλεκʼ, ἀλλὰ καταπεφρόντικα.	-0.0162162
What have you made of your slippers, you foolish man?	τὰς δʼ ἐμβάδας ποῖ τέτροφας ὦνόητε σύ;	0.146667
I have expended them, like Pericles, for needful purposes.	ὥσπερ Περικλέης ἐς τὸ δέον ἀπώλεσα.	0.223529
Come, move, let us go.	ἀλλʼ ἴθι βάδιζʼ, ἴωμεν·	-0.0789474
And then if you obey your father, go wrong if you like.	εἶτα τῷ πατρὶ πιθόμενος ἐξάμαρτε·	0.18
I also know that I formerly obeyed you, a lisping child of six years old, and bought you a go-cart at the Diasia, with the first obolus I received from the Heliaea.	κἀγώ τοί ποτε, οἶδʼ, ἑξέτει σοι τραυλίσαντι πιθόμενος, ὃν πρῶτον ὀβολὸν ἔλαβον ἡλιαστικόν, τούτου ʼπριάμην σοι Διασίοις ἁμαξίδα.	0.0895522
You will assuredly some time at length be grieved at this.	ἦ μὴν σὺ τούτοις τῷ χρόνῳ ποτʼ ἀχθέσει.	0.171429
It is well done of you that you obeyed.	εὖ γʼ ὅτι ἐπείσθης.	0.271875
Come hither, come hither O Socrates!	δεῦρο δεῦρʼ ὦ Σώκρατες, ἔξελθʼ·	0.05625
Come forth, for I bring to you this son of mine, having persuaded him against his will.	ἄγω γάρ σοι τὸν υἱὸν τουτονὶ ἄκοντʼ ἀναπείσας.	0.245833
For he is still childish, and not used to the baskets here.	νηπύτιος γάρ ἐστʼ ἔτι, καὶ τῶν κρεμαθρῶν οὔπω τρίβων τῶν ἐνθάδε.	-0.104082
You would yourself be used to them if you were hanged.	αὐτὸς τρίβων εἴης ἄν, εἰ κρέμαιό γε.	0.173333
A mischief take you!	οὐκ ἐς κόρακας;	0.133333
Do you abuse your teacher? ~~~ Were hanged quoth 'a!	καταρᾷ σὺ τῷ διδασκάλῳ;	-0.00348837
How sillily he pronounced it, and with lips wide apart!	ἰδοὺ κρέμαιʼ, ὡς ἠλίθιον ἐφθέγξατο καὶ τοῖσι χείλεσιν διερρυηκόσιν.	-0.191489
How can this youth ever learn an acquittal from a trial or a legal summons, or persuasive refutation?	πῶς ἂν μάθοι ποθʼ οὗτος ἀπόφυξιν δίκης ἢ κλῆσιν ἢ χαύνωσιν ἀναπειστηρίαν;	0.134118
And yet Hyperbolus learned this at the cost of a talent.	καίτοι γε ταλάντου τοῦτʼ ἔμαθεν Ὑπέρβολος.	0.108511
Never mind; teach him.	ἀμέλει δίδασκε·	0.15
He is clever by nature.	θυμόσοφός ἐστιν φύσει·	-0.03
Indeed, from his earliest years, when he was a little fellow only so big, he was wont to form houses and carve ships within-doors, and make little wagons of leather, and make frogs out of pomegranate-rinds, you can't think how cleverly.	εὐθύς γέ τοι παιδάριον ὄν τυννουτονὶ ἔπλαττεν ἔνδον οἰκίας ναῦς τʼ ἔγλυφεν, ἁμαξίδας τε σκυτίνας ἠργάζετο, κἀκ τῶν σιδίων βατράχους ἐποίει πῶς δοκεῖς.	0.190355
But see that he learns those two causes; the better, whatever it may be; and the worse, which, by maintaining what is unjust, overturns the better.	ὅπως δʼ ἐκείνω τὼ λόγω μαθήσεται, τὸν κρείττονʼ ὅστις ἐστὶ καὶ τὸν ἥττονα, ὃς τἄδικα λέγων ἀνατρέπει τὸν κρείττονα·	0.095122
If not both, at any rate the unjust one by all means.	ἐὰν δὲ μή, τὸν γοῦν ἄδικον πάσῃ τέχνῃ.	0.118605
He shall learn it himself from the two causes in person.	αὐτὸς μαθήσεται παρʼ αὐτοῖν τοῖν λόγοιν.	0.121277
I will take my departure.	ἐγὼ δʼ ἀπέσομαι.	0.177273
Remember this now, that he is to be able to reply to all just arguments.	τοῦτό νυν μέμνησʼ, ὅπως πρὸς πάντα τὰ δίκαιʼ ἀντιλέγειν δυνήσεται.	0
