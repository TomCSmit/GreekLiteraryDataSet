O ye greatly venerable Clouds, ye have clearly heard me when I called.	οὕτως αὐτὰς τετρεμαίνω καὶ πεφόβημαι·	0.238983
Did you hear the voice, and the thunder which bellowed at the same time, feared as a god?	κεἰ θέμις ἐστίν, νυνί γʼ ἤδη, κεἰ μὴ θέμις ἐστί, χεσείω.	0.209589
I too worship you, O ye highly honoured, and am inclined to reply to the thundering, so much do I tremble at them and am alarmed.	οὐ μὴ σκώψει μηδὲ ποιήσεις ἅπερ οἱ τρυγοδαίμονες οὗτοι, ἀλλʼ εὐφήμει·	0.24
And whether it be lawful, or be not lawful, I have a desire just now to ease myself.	μέγα γάρ τι θεῶν κινεῖται σμῆνος ἀοιδαῖς.	0.269118
Don't scoff, nor do what these poor-devil-poets do, but use words of good omen, for a great swarm of goddesses is in motion with their songs.	παρθένοι ὀμβροφόροι ἔλθωμεν λιπαρὰν χθόνα Παλλάδος, εὔανδρον γᾶν Κέκροπος ὀψόμεναι πολυήρατον·	0.153846
Ye rain-bringing virgins, let us come to the fruitful land of Pallas, to view the much-loved country of Cecrops, abounding in brave men; where is reverence for sacred rites not to be divulged; where the house that receives the initiated is thrown open in holy mystic rites; and gifts to the celestial gods; and high-roofed temples, and statues; and most sacred processions in honour of the blessed gods; and well-crowned sacrifices to the gods, and feasts, at all seasons; and with the approach of spring the Bacchic festivity, and the rousings of melodious choruses, and the loud-sounding music of flutes.	οὗ σέβας ἀρρήτων ἱερῶν, ἵνα μυστοδόκος δόμος ἐν τελεταῖς ἁγίαις ἀναδείκνυται, οὐρανίοις τε θεοῖς δωρήματα, ναοί θʼ ὑψερεφεῖς καὶ ἀγάλματα, καὶ πρόσοδοι μακάρων ἱερώταται, εὐστέφανοί τε θεῶν θυσίαι θαλίαι τε, παντοδαπαῖς ἐν ὥραις, ἦρί τʼ ἐπερχομένῳ Βρομία χάρις, εὐκελάδων τε χορῶν ἐρεθίσματα, καὶ μοῦσα βαρύβρομος αὐλῶν.	0.261614
