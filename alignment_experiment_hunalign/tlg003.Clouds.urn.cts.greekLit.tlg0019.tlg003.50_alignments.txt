Oh, oh, my child! ~~~ Huzza!	ἰὼ ἰὼ τέκνον, ἰὼ ἰοῦ ἰοῦ.	-0.169565
Huzza! ~~~ How I am delighted at the first sight of your complexion!	ὡς ἥδομαί σου πρῶτα τὴν χρόαν ἰδών.	-0.01875
Now, indeed, you are, in the first place, negative and disputatious to look at, and this fashion native to the place plainly appears, the what do you say?	νῦν μέν γʼ ἰδεῖν εἶ πρῶτον ἐξαρνητικὸς κἀντιλογικός, καὶ τοῦτο τοὐπιχώριον ἀτεχνῶς ἐπανθεῖ, τὸ τί λέγεις σύ;	0.135937
and the seeming to be injured when, I well know, you are injuring and inflicting a wrong; and in your countenance there is the Attic look.	καὶ δοκεῖν ἀδικοῦντʼ ἀδικεῖσθαι καὶ κακουργοῦντʼ οἶδʼ ὅτι·	0.297345
	ἐπὶ τοῦ προσώπου τʼ ἐστὶν Ἀττικὸν βλέπος.	-0.3
Now, therefore, see that you save me, since you have also ruined me.	νῦν οὖν ὅπως σώσεις μʼ, ἐπεὶ κἀπώλεσας.	0.226316
What, pray, do you fear?	φοβεῖ δὲ δὴ τί;	0.214286
The Old and New.	τὴν ἕνην τε καὶ νέαν.	-0.192857
Why, is any day old and new?	ἕνη γάρ ἐστι καὶ νέα τις ἡμέρα;	-0.104348
	εἰς ἥν γε θήσειν τὰ πρυτανεῖά φασί μοι.	-0.3
Yes; on which they say that they will make their deposits against me.	ἀπολοῦσʼ ἄρʼ αὔθʼ οἱ θέντες·	0.277778
Then those that have made them will lose them; for it is not possible that two days can be one day.	οὐ γὰρ ἔσθʼ ὅπως μίʼ ἡμέρα γένοιτʼ ἂν ἡμέρα δύο.	0.28125
	οὐκ ἂν γένοιτο;	-0.3
Can not it?	πῶς γάρ;	0.15
Certainly not; unless the same woman can be both old and young at the same time.	εἰ μή πέρ γʼ ἅμα αὑτὴ γένοιτʼ ἂν γραῦς τε καὶ νέα γυνή.	0.177273
And yet it is the law.	καὶ μὴν νενόμισταί γʼ.	-0.0666667
For they do not, I think, rightly understand what the law means.	οὐ γάρ, οἶμαι, τὸν νόμον ἴσασιν ὀρθῶς ὅ τι νοεῖ.	0.133333
And what does it mean?	νοεῖ δὲ τί;	0.284211
The ancient Solon was by nature the commons' friend.	ὁ Σόλων ὁ παλαιὸς ἦν φιλόδημος τὴν φύσιν.	0.113333
This surely is nothing whatever to the Old and New.	τουτὶ μὲν οὐδέν πω πρὸς ἕνην τε καὶ νέαν.	0.0976744
He therefore made the summons for two days, for the Old and New, that the deposits might be made on the first of the month.	ἐκεῖνος οὖν τὴν κλῆσιν ἐς δύʼ ἡμέρας ἔθηκεν, ἔς γε τὴν ἕνην τε καὶ νέαν, ἵνʼ αἱ θέσεις γίγνοιντο τῇ νουμηνίᾳ.	0.024
Why, pray, did he add the old day?	ἵνα δὴ τί τὴν ἕνην προσέθηχʼ;	0.0428571
	ἵνʼ ὦ μέλε παρόντες οἱ φεύγοντες ἡμέρᾳ μιᾷ πρότερον ἀπαλλάττοινθʼ ἑκόντες, εἰ δὲ μή, ἕωθεν ὑπανιῷντο τῇ νουμηνία.	-0.3
In order, my good sir, that the defendants, being present a day before, might compromise the matter of their own accord; but if not, that they might be worried on the morning of the new moon.	πῶς οὐ δέχονται δῆτα τῇ νουμηνίᾳ ἁρχαὶ τὰ πρυτανεῖʼ, ἀλλʼ ἕνῃ τε καὶ νέᾳ;	0.245865
Why, then, do the magistrates not receive the deposits on the new moon, but on the Old and New?	ὅπερ οἱ προτένθαι γὰρ δοκοῦσί μοι ποιεῖν·	0.292105
They seem to me to do what the forestallers do: in order that they may appreciate the deposits as soon as possible, on this account they have the first pick by one day.	ὅπως τάχιστα τὰ πρυτανεῖʼ ὑφελοίατο, διὰ τοῦτο προὐτένθευσαν ἡμέρᾳ μιᾷ.	0.290977
Bravo!	εὖ γʼ·	0.0857143
Ye wretches, why do you sit senseless, the gain of us wise men, being blocks, ciphers, mere sheep, jars heaped together, wherefore I must sing an encomium upon myself and this my son, on account of our good fortune.	ὦ κακοδαίμονες, τί κάθησθʼ ἀβέλτεροι, ἡμέτερα κέρδη τῶν σοφῶν ὄντες, λίθοι, ἀριθμός, πρόβατʼ ἄλλως, ἀμφορῆς νενησμένοι;	0.242697
