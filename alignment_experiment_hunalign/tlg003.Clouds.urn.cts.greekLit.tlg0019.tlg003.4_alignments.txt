You are a stupid fellow, by Jove!	σύγγνωθί μοι·	0.264
who have kicked against the door so very carelessly, and have caused the miscarriage of an idea which I had conceived.	τηλοῦ γὰρ οἰκῶ τῶν ἀγρῶν.	-0.00612245
Pardon me; for I dwell afar in the country.	ἀλλʼ εἰπέ μοι τὸ πρᾶγμα τοὐξημβλωμένον.	-0.00833333
But tell me the thing which has been made to miscarry.	ἀλλʼ οὐ θέμις πλὴν τοῖς μαθηταῖσιν λέγειν.	0.0866667
It is not lawful to mention it, except to disciples.	λέγε νυν ἐμοὶ θαρρῶν·	0.27
Tell it, then, to me without fear; for I here am come as a disciple to the thinking-shop.	ἐγὼ γὰρ οὑτοσὶ ἥκω μαθητὴς ἐς τὸ φροντιστήριον. ~~~ λέξω.	-0.0328767
I will tell you; but you must regard these as mysteries.	νομίσαι δὲ ταῦτα χρὴ μυστήρια.	0.248936
	ἀνήρετʼ ἄρτι Χαιρεφῶντα Σωκράτης ψύλλαν ὁπόσους ἅλλοιτο τοὺς αὑτῆς πόδας·	-0.3
Socrates lately asked Chaerephon about a flea, how many of its own feet it jumped; for after having bit the eyebrow of Chaerephon, it leaped away onto the head of Socrates.	δακοῦσα γὰρ τοῦ Χαιρεφῶντος τὴν ὀφρῦν ἐπὶ τὴν κεφαλὴν τὴν Σωκράτους ἀφήλατο.	0.3
How then did he measure this?	πῶς δῆτα διεμέτρησε;	0.144
Most cleverly.	δεξιώτατα.	0.171429
He melted some wax; and then took the flea and dipped its feet in the wax; and then a pair of Persian slippers stuck to it when cooled.	κηρὸν διατήξας, εἶτα τὴν ψύλλαν λαβὼν ἐνέβαψεν ἐς τὸν κηρὸν αὐτῆς τὼ πόδε, κᾆτα ψυχείσῃ περιέφυσαν Περσικαί.	0.0633028
Having gently loosened these, he measured back the distance.	ταύτας ὑπολύσας ἀνεμέτρει τὸ χωρίον.	0.220755

Chaerephon the Sphettian asked him whether he thought gnats buzzed through the mouth or the breech.	τί δῆτʼ ἐκεῖνος εἶπε περὶ τῆς ἐμπίδος;	0.240845
What, then, did he say about the gnat?	ἔφασκεν εἶναι τοὔντερον τῆς ἐμπίδος στενόν·	-0.16875
He said the intestine of the gnat was narrow and that the wind went forcibly through it, being slender, straight to the breech; and then that the rump, being hollow where it is adjacent to the narrow part, resounded through the violence of the wind.	διὰ λεπτοῦ δʼ ὄντος αὐτοῦ τὴν πνοὴν βίᾳ βαδίζειν εὐθὺ τοὐρροπυγίου· ~~~ ἔπειτα κοῖλον πρὸς στενῷ προσκείμενον τὸν πρωκτὸν ἠχεῖν ὑπὸ βίας τοῦ πνεύματος.	-0.0495146

But he was lately deprived of a great idea by a lizard.	τίνα τρόπον;	-0.0136364
In what way? ~~~ Tell me.	κάτειπέ μοι.	-0.015
As he was investigating the courses of the moon and her revolutions, then as he was gaping upward a lizard in the darkness dropped upon him from the roof.	ζητοῦντος αὐτοῦ τῆς σελήνης τὰς ὁδοὺς καὶ τὰς περιφορὰς εἶτʼ ἄνω κεχηνότος ἀπὸ τῆς ὀροφῆς νύκτωρ γαλεώτης κατέχεσεν.	0.092126

Yesterday evening there was no supper for us.	ἐχθὲς δέ γʼ ἡμῖν δεῖπνον οὐκ ἦν ἑσπέρας.	0.0307692
Well.	εἶεν·	0
What then did he contrive for provisions?	τί οὖν πρὸς τἄλφιτʼ ἐπαλαμήσατο;	0.1
He sprinkled fine ashes on the table, and bent a little spit, and then took it as a pair of compasses and filched a cloak from the Palaestra.	κατὰ τῆς τραπέζης καταπάσας λεπτὴν τέφραν κάμψας ὀβελίσκον εἶτα διαβήτην λαβὼν ἐκ τῆς παλαίστρας θοἰμάτιον ὑφείλετο.	0.0469565
