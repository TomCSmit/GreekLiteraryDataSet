Do you, yourself, first find out and state what you wish.	αὐτὸς ὅ τι βούλει πρῶτος ἐξευρὼν λέγε.	0.1625
You have heard a thousand times what I wish. ~~~ About the interest; so that I may pay no one.	ἀκήκοας μυριάκις ἁγὼ βούλομαι, περὶ τῶν τόκων, ὅπως ἂν ἀποδῶ μηδενί.	-0.096
Come then, wrap yourself up, and having given your mind play with subtilty, revolve your affairs by little and little, rightly distinguishing and examining.	ἴθι νῦν καλύπτου καὶ σχάσας τὴν φροντίδα λεπτὴν κατὰ μικρὸν περιφρόνει τὰ πράγματα, ὀρθῶς διαιρῶν καὶ σκοπῶν. ~~~ οἴμοι τάλας.	-0.0716418

Now tell me this, pray; if I were to purchase a Thessalian witch, and draw down the moon by night, and then shut it up, as if it were a mirror, in a round crest-case, and then carefully keep it- What good, pray, would this do you?	εἰπὲ δή νύν μοι — τὸ τί; ~~~ γυναῖκα φαρμακίδʼ εἰ πριάμενος Θετταλὴν καθέλοιμι νύκτωρ τὴν σελήνην, εἶτα δὴ αὐτὴν καθείρξαιμʼ ἐς λοφεῖον στρογγύλον, ὥσπερ κάτοπτρον, κᾆτα τηροίην ἔχων — τί δῆτα τοῦτʼ ἂν ὠφελήσειέν σʼ;	-0.121622
