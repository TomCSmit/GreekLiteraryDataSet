By Respiration, and Chaos, and Air, I have not seen any man so boorish, nor so impracticable, nor so stupid, nor so forgetful; who, while learning some little petty quibbles, forgets them before he has learned them.	μὰ τὴν Ἀναπνοὴν μὰ τὸ Χάος μὰ τὸν Ἀέρα οὐκ εἶδον οὕτως ἄνδρʼ ἄγροικον οὐδένα οὐδʼ ἄπορον οὐδὲ σκαιὸν οὐδʼ ἐπιλήσμονα·	0.238333

About measures, or rhythms, or verses?	περὶ τῶν μέτρων ἔγωγʼ·	0.229412
I should prefer to learn about measures; for it is but lately I was cheated out of two choenices by a meal-huckster.	ἔναγχος γάρ ποτε ὑπʼ ἀλφιταμοιβοῦ παρεκόπην διχοινίκῳ.	0.284375
I do not ask you this, but which you account the most beautiful measure; the trimetre or the tetrameter?	οὐ τοῦτʼ ἐρωτῶ σʼ, ἀλλʼ ὅ τι κάλλιστον μέτρον ἡγεῖ·	0.282759
Make a wager then with me, if the semisextarius be not a tetrameter.	πότερα τὸ τρίμετρον ἢ τὸ τετράμετρον;	0.247368
