Hail therefore, O mistresses!	χαίρετε τοίνυν ὦ δέσποιναι·	0.0444444
And now, if ever ye did to any other, to me also utter a voice reaching to heaven, O all-powerful queens.	καὶ νῦν, εἴπερ τινὶ κἄλλῳ, οὐρανομήκη ῥήξατε κἀμοὶ φωνήν, ὦ παμβασίλειαι.	0.132558
Hail, O ancient veteran, hunter after learned speeches! ~~~ And thou, O priest of most subtle trifles!	χαῖρʼ ὦ πρεσβῦτα παλαιογενὲς θηρατὰ λόγων φιλομούσων, σύ τε λεπτοτάτων λήρων ἱερεῦ, φράζε πρὸς ἡμᾶς ὅ τι χρῄζεις·	-0.20407
Tell us what you require? ~~~ For we would not hearken to any other of the recent meteorological sophists, except to Prodicus; to him, on account of his wisdom and intelligence; and to you, because you walk proudly in the streets, and cast your eyes askance, and endure many hardships with bare feet, and in reliance upon us lookest supercilious.	οὐ γὰρ ἂν ἄλλῳ γʼ ὑπακούσαιμεν τῶν νῦν μετεωροσοφιστῶν πλὴν ἢ Προδίκῳ, τῷ μὲν σοφίας καὶ γνώμης οὕνεκα, σοὶ δέ, ὅτι βρενθύει τʼ ἐν ταῖσιν ὁδοῖς καὶ τὠφθαλμὼ παραβάλλεις, κἀνυπόδητος κακὰ πόλλʼ ἀνέχει κἀφʼ ἡμῖν σεμνοπροσωπεῖς.	-0.0632404
O Earth, what a voice! ~~~ How holy and dignified and wondrous!	ὦ γῆ τοῦ φθέγματος, ὡς ἱερὸν καὶ σεμνὸν καὶ τερατῶδες.	-0.135577
For, in fact, these alone are goddesses; and all the rest is nonsense.	αὗται γάρ τοι μόναι εἰσὶ θεαί, τἄλλα δὲ πάντʼ ἐστὶ φλύαρος.	0.0711864
But come, by the Earth, is not Jupiter, the Olympian, a god?	ὁ Ζεὺς δʼ ἡμῖν, φέρε πρὸς τῆς γῆς, οὑλύμπιος οὐ θεός ἐστιν;	-0.024
What Jupiter?	ποῖος Ζεύς;	0.115385
Do not trifle.	οὐ μὴ ληρήσεις·	-0.0692308
There is no Jupiter.	οὐδʼ ἔστι Ζεύς.	0.133333
What do you say?	τί λέγεις σύ;	0.128571
Who rains then?	ἀλλὰ τίς ὕει;	0.0642857
For first of all explain this to me.	τουτὶ γὰρ ἔμοιγʼ ἀπόφηναι πρῶτον ἁπάντων.	-0.18
These to be sure.	αὗται δήπου·	0.12
I will teach you it by powerful evidence.	μεγάλοις δέ σʼ ἐγὼ σημείοις αὐτὸ διδάξω.	-0.0171429
Come, where have you ever seen him raining at any time without Clouds?	φέρε ποῦ γὰρ πώποτʼ ἄνευ Νεφελῶν ὕοντʼ ἤδη τεθέασαι;	0.122034
And yet he ought to rain in fine weather, and these be absent.	καίτοι χρῆν αἰθρίας ὕειν αὐτόν, ταύτας δʼ ἀποδημεῖν.	0.0411765
By Apollo, of a truth you have rightly confirmed this by your present argument.	νὴ τὸν Ἀπόλλω τοῦτό γέ τοι δὴ τῷ νῦν λόγῳ εὖ προσέφυσας·	0.152239
	καίτοι πρότερον τὸν Δίʼ ἀληθῶς ᾤμην διὰ κοσκίνου οὐρεῖν.	-0.3
And yet, before this, I really thought that Jupiter caused the rain.	ἀλλʼ ὅστις ὁ βροντῶν ἐστι φράσον·	0.27931
But tell me who is it that thunders.	τοῦτό με ποιεῖ τετρεμαίνειν.	0.08
This makes me tremble. ~~~ These, as they roll, thunder.	αὗται βροντῶσι κυλινδόμεναι.	-0.0223404
In what way? ~~~ you all-daring man!	τῷ τρόπῳ ὦ πάντα σὺ τολμῶν;	-0.095
When they are full of much water, and are compelled to be borne along, being necessarily precipitated when full of rain, then they fall heavily upon each other and burst and clap.	ὅταν ἐμπλησθῶσʼ ὕδατος πολλοῦ κἀναγκασθῶσι φέρεσθαι, κατακρημνάμεναι πλήρεις ὄμβρου διʼ ἀνάγκην, εἶτα βαρεῖαι εἰς ἀλλήλας ἐμπίπτουσαι ῥήγνυνται καὶ παταγοῦσιν.	0.00201342
Who is it that compels them to borne along? ~~~ Is it not Jupiter?	ὁ δʼ ἀναγκάζων ἐστὶ τίς αὐτάς, οὐχ ὁ Ζεύς, ὥστε φέρεσθαι;	-0.133019
By no means, but aethereal Vortex.	ἥκιστʼ ἀλλʼ αἰθέριος Δῖνος.	0.08
Vortex?	Δῖνος;	0.1125
It had escaped my notice that Jupiter did not exist, and that Vortex now reigned in his stead.	τουτί μʼ ἐλελήθειν, ὁ Ζεὺς οὐκ ὤν, ἀλλʼ ἀντʼ αὐτοῦ Δῖνος νυνὶ βασιλεύων.	0.103846
But you have taught me nothing as yet concerning the clap and the thunder.	ἀτὰρ οὐδέν πω περὶ τοῦ πατάγου καὶ τῆς βροντῆς μʼ ἐδίδαξας.	0.0822581
Have you not heard me, that I said that the Clouds, when full of moisture, dash against each other and clap by reason of their density?	οὐκ ἤκουσάς μου τὰς Νεφέλας ὕδατος μεστὰς ὅτι φημὶ ἐμπιπτούσας εἰς ἀλλήλας παταγεῖν διὰ τὴν πυκνότητα;	0.0945946
Come, how am I to believe this?	φέρε τουτὶ τῷ χρὴ πιστεύειν;	0.0115385
I'll teach you from your own case.	ἀπὸ σαυτοῦ ʼγώ σε διδάξω.	0.134483
Were you ever, after being stuffed with broth at the Panathenaic festival, then disturbed in your belly, and did a tumult suddenly rumble through it? ~~~ Yes, by Apollo!	ἤδη ζωμοῦ Παναθηναίοις ἐμπλησθεὶς εἶτʼ ἐταράχθης τὴν γαστέρα, καὶ κλόνος ἐξαίφνης αὐτὴν διεκορκορύγησεν;	-0.056383
And immediately the little broth plays the mischief with me, and is disturbed and rumbles like thunder, and grumbles dreadfully: at first gently pappax, pappax; and then it adds papa-pappax; and finally, it thunders downright papapappax, as they do.	νὴ τὸν Ἀπόλλω καὶ δεινὰ ποιεῖ γʼ εὐθύς μοι, καὶ τετάρακται χὤσπερ βροντὴ τὸ ζωμίδιον παταγεῖ καὶ δεινὰ κέκραγεν·	0.285149
	ἀτρέμας πρῶτον παππὰξ παππάξ, κἄπειτʼ ἐπάγει παπαπαππάξ, χὤταν χέζω, κομιδῇ βροντᾷ παπαπαππὰξ ὥσπερ ἐκεῖναι.	-0.3
