Do you see this little door and little house?	ὁρᾷς τὸ θύριον τοῦτο καὶ τᾠκίδιον;	0.0947368
I see it.	ὁρῶ.	0.225
What then, pray, is this, father?	τί οὖν τοῦτʼ ἐστὶν ἐτεὸν ὦ πάτερ;	-0.0310345
This is a thinking-shop of wise spirits.	ψυχῶν σοφῶν τοῦτʼ ἐστὶ φροντιστήριον.	-0.00857143
There dwell men who in speaking of the heavens persuade people that it is an oven, and that it encompasses us, and that we are the embers.	ἐνταῦθʼ ἐνοικοῦσʼ ἄνδρες, οἳ τὸν οὐρανὸν λέγοντες ἀναπείθουσιν ὡς ἔστιν πνιγεύς, κἄστιν περὶ ἡμᾶς οὗτος, ἡμεῖς δʼ ἄνθρακες.	-0.0079646
These men teach, if one give them money, to conquer in speaking, right or wrong.	οὗτοι διδάσκουσʼ, ἀργύριον ἤν τις διδῷ, λέγοντα νικᾶν καὶ δίκαια κἄδικα.	0.0223881
Who are they?	εἰσὶν δὲ τίνες;	-0.125
I do not know the name accurately.	οὐκ οἶδʼ ἀκριβῶς τοὔνομα·	0.0827586
They are minute philosophers, noble and excellent.	μεριμνοφροντισταὶ καλοί τε κἀγαθοί.	0.16
Bah! ~~~ They are rogues; I know them.	αἰβοῖ πονηροί γʼ, οἶδα.	-0.0532258
You mean the quacks, the pale-faced wretches, the bare-footed fellows, of whose numbers are the miserable Socrates and Chaerephon.	τοὺς ἀλαζόνας τοὺς ὠχριῶντας τοὺς ἀνυποδήτους λέγεις, ὧν ὁ κακοδαίμων Σωκράτης καὶ Χαιρεφῶν.	0.148673
Hold! ~~~ Hold!	ἢ ἢ σιώπα·	-0.0692308
Be silent! ~~~ Do not say anything foolish.	μηδὲν εἴπῃς νήπιον.	-0.00416667
But, if you have any concern for your father's patrimony, become one of them, having given up your horsemanship.	ἀλλʼ εἴ τι κήδει τῶν πατρῴων ἀλφίτων, τούτων γενοῦ μοι σχασάμενος τὴν ἱππικήν.	0.161053
I would not, by Bacchus, even if you were to give me the pheasants which Leogoras rears!	οὐκ ἂν μὰ τὸν Διόνυσον, εἰ δοίης γέ μοι τοὺς φασιανοὺς οὓς τρέφει Λεωγόρας.	0.0616438
Go, I entreat you, dearest of men, go and be taught.	ἴθʼ ἀντιβολῶ σʼ ὦ φίλτατʼ ἀνθρώπων ἐμοὶ ἐλθὼν διδάσκου.	-0.118605
Why, what shall I learn?	καὶ τί σοι μαθήσομαι;	0.0714286
They say that among them are both the two causes--the better cause, whichever that is, and the worse: they say that the one of these two causes, the worse, prevails, though it speaks on the unjust side.	εἶναι παρʼ αὐτοῖς φασιν ἄμφω τὼ λόγω, τὸν κρείττονʼ, ὅστις ἐστί, καὶ τὸν ἥττονα.	0.247183
If, therefore you learn for me this unjust cause, I would not pay any one, not even an obolus of these debts, which I owe at present on your account.	τούτοιν τὸν ἕτερον τοῖν λόγοιν, τὸν ἥττονα, νικᾶν λέγοντά φασι τἀδικώτερα.	0.270248
I can not comply; for I should not dare to look upon the knights, having lost all my colour.	ἢν οὖν μάθῃς μοι τὸν ἄδικον τοῦτον λόγον, ἃ νῦν ὀφείλω διὰ σέ, τούτων τῶν χρεῶν οὐκ ἂν ἀποδοίην οὐδʼ ἂν ὀβολὸν οὐδενί.	-0.24
Then, by Ceres, you shall not eat any of my good!	οὐκ ἂν πιθοίμην·	0.212903

My uncle Megacles will not permit me to be without a horse.	ἀλλʼ οὐ περιόψεταί μʼ ὁ θεῖος Μεγακλέης ἄνιππον.	0.0673469
But I'll go in, and pay no heed to you.	ἀλλʼ εἴσειμι, σοῦ δʼ οὐ φροντιῶ.	0.0387097
Though fallen, still I will not lie prostrate: but having prayed to the gods, I will go myself to the thinking-shop and get taught.	ἀλλʼ οὐδʼ ἐγὼ μέντοι πεσών γε κείσομαι, ἀλλʼ εὐξάμενος τοῖσιν θεοῖς διδάξομαι αὐτὸς βαδίζων ἐς τὸ φροντιστήριον.	0.0412844

I must go.	ἰτητέον.	0.0333333
Why thus do I loiter and not knock at the door?	τί ταῦτʼ ἔχων στραγγεύομαι, ἀλλʼ οὐχὶ κόπτω τὴν θύραν;	-0.165789
