And Peleus married Thetis, too, through his modesty.	κᾆτʼ ἀπολιποῦσά γʼ αὐτὸν ᾤχετʼ·	0.202174
And then she went off and left him; for he was not lustful, nor an agreeable bedfellow to spend the night with.	οὐ γὰρ ἦν ὑβριστὴς οὐδʼ ἡδὺς ἐν τοῖς στρώμασιν τὴν νύκτα παννυχίζειν·	0.178022
Now a woman delights in being wantonly treated.	γυνὴ δὲ σιναμωρουμένη χαίρει·	0.197561
But you are an old dotard.	σὺ δʼ εἶ Κρόνιππος.	0.136364
For consider, O youth, all that attaches to modesty, and of how many pleasures you are about to be deprived--of women, of games at cottabus, of dainties, of drinking-bouts, of giggling.	σκέψαι γὰρ ὦ μειράκιον ἐν τῷ σωφρονεῖν ἅπαντα ἅνεστιν, ἡδονῶν θʼ ὅσων μέλλεις ἀποστερεῖσθαι, παίδων γυναικῶν κοττάβων ὄψων πότων κιχλισμῶν.	0.113462

You are undone, for you are unable to speak.	ἀδύνατος γὰρ εἶ λέγειν.	0.251351

For if you should happen to be detected as an adulterer, you will make this reply to him, that you have done him no injury : and then refer him to Jupiter, how even he is overcome by love and women .	μοιχὸς γὰρ ἢν τύχῃς ἁλούς, τάδʼ ἀντερεῖς πρὸς αὐτόν, ὡς οὐδὲν ἠδίκηκας·	0.238636

But what if he should suffer the radish through obeying you, and be depillated with hot ashes?	καίτοι σὺ θνητὸς ὢν θεοῦ πῶς μεῖζον ἂν δύναιο;	0.28481
