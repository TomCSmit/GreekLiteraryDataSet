Ah me, what madness!	οἴμοι παρανοίας·	0.0666667
How mad, then, I was when I ejected the gods on account of Socrates!	ὡς ἐμαινόμην ἄρα, ὅτʼ ἐξέβαλλον τοὺς θεοὺς διὰ Σωκράτη.	0.0589286
But O dear Hermes, by no means be wroth with me, nor destroy me; but pardon me, since I have gone crazy through prating.	ἀλλʼ ὦ φίλʼ Ἑρμῆ μηδαμῶς θύμαινέ μοι μηδέ μʼ ἐπιτρίψῃς, ἀλλὰ συγγνώμην ἔχε ἐμοῦ παρανοήσαντος ἀδολεσχίᾳ·	0.0122449
And become my adviser, whether I shall bring an action and prosecute them, or whatever you think.	καί μοι γενοῦ ξύμβουλος, εἴτʼ αὐτοὺς γραφὴν διωκάθω γραψάμενος εἴθʼ ὅ τι σοι δοκεῖ.	0.0621951
You advise me rightly, not permitting me to get up a lawsuit, but as soon as possible to set fire to the house of the prating fellows.	ὀρθῶς παραινεῖς οὐκ ἐῶν δικορραφεῖν, ἀλλʼ ὡς τάχιστʼ ἐμπιμπράναι τὴν οἰκίαν τῶν ἀδολεσχῶν.	0.13211
Come hither, come hither, Xanthias! ~~~ Come forth with a ladder and with a mattock and then mount upon the thinking-shop and dig down the roof, if you love your master, until you tumble the house upon them.	δεῦρο δεῦρʼ ὦ Ξανθία, κλίμακα λαβὼν ἔξελθε καὶ σμινύην φέρων, κἄπειτʼ ἐπαναβὰς ἐπὶ τὸ φροντιστήριον τὸ τέγος κατάσκαπτʼ, εἰ φιλεῖς τὸν δεσπότην, ἕως ἂν αὐτοῖς ἐμβάλῃς τὴν οἰκίαν·	-0.135
But let some one bring me a lighted torch and I'll make some of them this day suffer punishment, even if they be ever so much impostors.	ἐμοὶ δὲ δᾷδʼ ἐνεγκάτω τις ἡμμένην, κἀγώ τινʼ αὐτῶν τήμερον δοῦναι δίκην ἐμοὶ ποιήσω, κεἰ σφόδρʼ εἴσʼ ἀλαζόνες.	0.0621622
(from within) Hollo!	ἰοὺ ἰού.	0.264706
Hollo! ~~~ It is your business, O torch, to send forth abundant flame.	σὸν ἔργον ὦ δᾲς ἱέναι πολλὴν φλόγα.	-0.0155172
What are you doing, fellow?	ἄνθρωπε, τί ποιεῖς;	0.1625
What am I doing?	ὅ τι ποιῶ;	0.214286
Why, what else, than chopping logic with the beams of your house?	τί δʼ ἄλλο γʼ ἢ διαλεπτολογοῦμαι ταῖς δοκοῖς τῆς οἰκίας;	0.0490909
(from within) You will destroy us! ~~~ You will destroy us!	οἴμοι τίς ἡμῶν πυρπολεῖ τὴν οἰκίαν;	-0.0520408
For I also wish this very thing; unless my mattock deceive my hopes, or I should somehow fall first and break my neck.	ἐκεῖνος οὗπερ θοἰμάτιον εἰλήφατε.	0.152308
(from within). ~~~ Hollo you!	ἀπολεῖς ἀπολεῖς.	-0.054
	τοῦτʼ αὐτὸ γὰρ καὶ βούλομαι, ἢν ἡ σμινύη μοι μὴ προδῷ τὰς ἐλπίδας, ἢ ʼγὼ πρότερόν πως ἐκτραχηλισθῶ πεσών.	-0.3
What are you doing, pray, you fellow on the roof?	οὗτος τί ποιεῖς ἐτεὸν οὑπὶ τοῦ τέγους;	0.0804878
I am walking on air, and speculating about the sun.	ἀεροβατῶ καὶ περιφρονῶ τὸν ἥλιον.	0.153488
Ah me, unhappy! ~~~ I shall be suffocated, wretched man!	οἴμοι τάλας δείλαιος ἀποπνιγήσομαι.	-0.0606383
And I, miserable man, shall be burnt to death!	ἐγὼ δὲ κακοδαίμων γε κατακαυθήσομαι.	0.0846154
For what has come into your heads that you acted insolently toward the gods, and pried into the seat of the moon?	τί γὰρ μαθόντες τοὺς θεοὺς ὑβρίζετε, καὶ τῆς σελήνης ἐσκοπεῖσθε τὴν ἕδραν;	0.164516
Chase, pelt, smite them, for many reasons, but especially because you know that they offended against the gods!	δίωκε βάλλε παῖε, πολλῶν οὕνεκα, μάλιστα δʼ εἰδὼς τοὺς θεοὺς ὡς ἠδίκουν. ~~~ ἡγεῖσθʼ ἔξω·	-0.0536842
Lead the way out; for we have sufficiently acted as chorus for today.	κεχόρευται γὰρ μετρίως τό γε τήμερον ἡμῖν.	0.212069
