Then, ought a man to throw away any part of his own property? ~~~ Never!	εἶτʼ ἄνδρα τῶν αὑτοῦ τι χρὴ προϊέναι;	-0.0258621
But it were better then at once to put away blushes, rather than now to have trouble; since I am now dragging you to be a witness, for the sake of my own money; and further, in addition to this, I shall become an enemy to my fellow-tribesman.	οὐδέποτέ γʼ, ἀλλὰ κρεῖττον εὐθὺς ἦν τότε ἀπερυθριᾶσαι μᾶλλον ἢ σχεῖν πράγματα, ὅτε τῶν ἐμαυτοῦ γʼ ἕνεκα νυνὶ χρημάτων ἕλκω σε κλητεύσοντα, καὶ γενήσομαι ἐχθρὸς ἔτι πρὸς τούτοισιν ἀνδρὶ δημότῃ.	0.0642857
But never, while I live, will I disgrace my country, but will summon Strepsiades.	ἀτὰρ οὐδέποτέ γε τὴν πατρίδα καταισχυνῶ ζῶν, ἀλλὰ καλοῦμαι Στρεψιάδην — τίς οὑτοσί;	-0.0608696
Who's there? ~~~ For the Old and New.	ἐς τὴν ἕνην τε καὶ νέαν.	-0.06
I call you to witness, that he has named it for two days.	μαρτύρομαι, ὅτι ἐς δύʼ εἶπεν ἡμέρας.	0.176087
For what matter do you summon me?	τοῦ χρήματος;	0.264
For the twelve minae, which you received when you were buying the dapple-gray horse.	τῶν δώδεκα μνῶν, ἃς ἔλαβες ὠνούμενος τὸν ψαρὸν ἵππον.	0.195833
A horse?	ἵππον;	0.1125
Do you not hear?	οὐκ ἀκούετε;	0.0857143
I, whom you all know to hate horsemanship! ~~~ And, by Jupiter!	ὃν πάντες ὑμεῖς ἴστε μισοῦνθʼ ἱππικήν.	-0.0576923
You swore by the gods too, that you would repay it. ~~~ Ay, by Jove!	καὶ νὴ Δίʼ ἀποδώσειν γʼ ἐπώμνυς τοὺς θεούς.	-0.0638889
	μὰ τὸν Δίʼ οὐ γάρ πω τότʼ ἐξηπίστατο Φειδιππίδης μοι τὸν ἀκατάβλητον λόγον.	-0.3
For then my Phidippides did not yet know the irrefragable argument.	νῦν δὲ διὰ τοῦτʼ ἔξαρνος εἶναι διανοεῖ;	0.222414
And do you now intend, on this account, to deny the debt?	τί γὰρ ἄλλʼ ἂν ἀπολαύσαιμι τοῦ μαθήματος;	0.121277
Why, what good should I get else from his instruction?	καὶ ταῦτʼ ἐθελήσεις ἀπομόσαι μοι τοὺς θεοὺς ἵνʼ ἂν κελεύσω ʼγώ σε;	-0.169565
And will you be willing to deny these upon oath of the gods?	τοὺς ποίους θεούς;	0.154545
What gods? ~~~ Jupiter, Mercury, and Neptune.	τὸν Δία, τὸν Ἑρμῆν, τὸν Ποσειδῶ.	-0.0730769
Yes, by Jupiter! ~~~ And would pay down, too, a three-obol piece besides to swear.	νὴ Δία κἂν προσκαταθείην γʼ ὥστʼ ὀμόσαι τριώβολον.	-0.0485294
Then may you perish some day for your impudence!	ἀπόλοιο τοίνυν ἕνεκʼ ἀναιδείας ἔτι.	0.117073
This man would be the better for it if he were cleansed by rubbing with salt.	ἁλσὶν διασμηχθεὶς ὄναιτʼ ἂν οὑτοσί.	0.27619
Ah me, how you deride me!	οἴμʼ ὡς καταγελᾷς.	0.1
He will contain six choae.	ἓξ χοᾶς χωρήσεται.	0.156522
By great Jupiter and the gods, you certainly shall not do this to me with impunity!	οὔ τοι μὰ τὸν Δία τὸν μέγαν καὶ τοὺς θεοὺς ἐμοῦ καταπροίξει.	0.134783
I like your gods amazingly; and Jupiter, sworn by, is ridiculous to the knowing ones.	θαυμασίως ἥσθην θεοῖς, καὶ Ζεὺς γέλοιος ὀμνύμενος τοῖς εἰδόσιν.	0.116667
You will assuredly suffer punishment, some time or other, for this.	ἦ μὴν σὺ τούτων τῷ χρόνῳ δώσεις δίκην.	0.253448
	ἀλλʼ εἴτʼ ἀποδώσεις μοι τὰ χρήματʼ εἴτε μή, ἀπόπεμψον ἀποκρινάμενος. ~~~ ἔχε νυν ἥσυχος.	-0.3
But answer and dismiss me, whether you are going to repay me my money or not.	ἐγὼ γὰρ αὐτίκʼ ἀποκρινοῦμαί σοι σαφῶς.	0.252381
Keep quiet now, for I will presently answer you distinctly.	τί σοι δοκεῖ δράσειν;	0.186486
(to his summons-witness).	ἀποδώσειν μοι δοκεῖ.	0.125
What do you think he will do? ~~~ I think he will pay you.	ποῦ ʼσθʼ οὗτος ἁπαιτῶν με τἀργύριον;	-0.0733333
Where is this man who asks me for his money?	λέγε τουτὶ τί ἔστι;	0.282353
Tell me what is this? ~~~ What is this?	τοῦθʼ ὅ τι ἐστί;	-0.0103448
A kardopos.	κάρδοπος.	0.109091
And do you then ask me for your money, being such an ignorant person?	ἔπειτʼ ἀπαιτεῖς τἀργύριον τοιοῦτος ὤν;	0.210526
I would not pay, not even an obolus, to any one who called the kardope kardopos.	οὐκ ἂν ἀποδοίην οὐδʼ ἂν ὀβολὸν οὐδενί, ὅστις καλέσειε κάρδοπον τὴν καρδόπην.	-0.0318182
Then won't you pay me? ~~~ Not, as far as I know.	οὐκ ἄρʼ ἀποδώσεις;	-0.0128571
Will you not then pack off as fast as possible from my door?	οὐχ ὅσον γέ μʼ εἰδέναι.	0.241463
I will depart; and be assured of this, that I will make deposit against you, or may I live no longer!	οὔκουν ἀνύσας τι θᾶττον ἀπολιταργιεῖς ἀπὸ τῆς θύρας;	0.241463
Then you will lose it besides, in addition to your twelve minae.	ἄπειμι, καὶ τοῦτʼ ἴσθʼ ὅτι θήσω πρυτανεῖʼ ἢ μηκέτι ζῴην ἐγώ.	0
And yet I do not wish you to suffer this, because you named the kardopos floolishly.	καὶ προσαπολεῖς ἄρʼ αὐτὰ πρὸς ταῖς δώδεκα.	0.261429
	καίτοι σε τοῦτό γʼ οὐχὶ βούλομαι παθεῖν, ὁτιὴ ʼκάλεσας εὐηθικῶς τὴν κάρδοπον.	-0.3
