After this, when this son was born to us, to me, forsooth, and to my excellent wife, we squabbled then about the name: for she was for adding hippos to the name, Xanthippus, or Charippus, or Callipides; but I was for giving him the name of his grandfather, Phidonides.	μετὰ ταῦθʼ, ὅπως νῷν ἐγένεθʼ υἱὸς οὑτοσί, ἐμοί τε δὴ καὶ τῇ γυναικὶ τἀγαθῇ, περὶ τοὐνόματος δὴ ʼντεῦθεν ἐλοιδορούμεθα·	0.295872

But I used to say, Nay, rather, when dressed in a leathern jerkin, you shall drive goats from Phelleus, like your father.	ἐγὼ δʼ ἔφην, ὅταν μὲν οὖν τὰς αἶγας ἐκ τοῦ φελλέως, ὥσπερ ὁ πατήρ σου, διφθέραν ἐνημμένος.	0.130693
He paid no attention to my words, but poured a horse-fever over my property.	ἀλλʼ οὐκ ἐπίθετο τοῖς ἐμοῖς οὐδὲν λόγοις, ἀλλʼ ἵππερόν μου κατέχεεν τῶν χρημάτων.	-0.09375
Now, therefore, by meditating the whole night, I have discovered one path for my course extraordinarily excellent; to which if I persuade this youth I shall be saved.	νῦν οὖν ὅλην τὴν νύκτα φροντίζων ὁδοῦ μίαν ηὗρον ἀτραπὸν δαιμονίως ὑπερφυᾶ, ἣν ἢν ἀναπείσω τουτονί, σωθήσομαι.	0.171429

Yes, by this Equestrian Neptune.	νὴ τὸν Ποσειδῶ τουτονὶ τὸν ἵππιον.	-0.062069
Nay, do not by any means mention this Equestrian to me, for this god is the author of my misfortunes.	μὴ ʼμοί γε τοῦτον μηδαμῶς τὸν ἵππιον·	0.233824
