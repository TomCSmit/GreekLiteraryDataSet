Nay, rather, you are yourself the cause of these things, having turned yourself to wicked courses.	ταυτὶ διʼ ὑμᾶς ὦ Νεθέλαι πέπονθʼ ἐγώ, ὑμῖν ἀναθεὶς ἅπαντα τἀμὰ πράγματα.	0.125
Why, pray, did you not tell me this, then, but excited with hopes a rustic and aged man?	αὐτὸς μὲν οὖν σαυτῷ σὺ τούτων αἴτιος, στρέψας σεαυτὸν ἐς πονηρὰ πράγματα.	0.0458333
We always do this to him whom we perceive to be a lover of wicked courses, until we precipitate him into misfortune, so that he may learn to fear the gods.	τί δῆτα ταῦτʼ οὔ μοι τότʼ ἠγορεύετε, ἀλλʼ ἄνδρʼ ἄγροικον καὶ γέροντʼ ἐπῄρετε;	0.269048

Ah me ! ~~~ it is severe, O Clouds!	ὤμοι πονηρά γʼ ὦ Νεφέλαι, δίκαια δέ.	-0.188889
But it is just; for I ought not to have withheld the money which I borrowed.	οὐ γάρ μʼ ἐχρῆν τὰ χρήμαθʼ ἁδανεισάμην ἀποστερεῖν.	0.15
	νῦν οὖν ὅπως ὦ φίλτατε τὸν Χαιρεφῶντα τὸν μιαρὸν καὶ Σωκράτη ἀπολεῖς μετʼ ἐμοῦ ʼλθών, οἳ σὲ κἄμʼ ἐξηπάτων.	-0.3
Now, therefore, come with me, my dearest son, that you may destroy the blackguard Chaerephon and Socrates, who deceived you and me.	ἀλλʼ οὐκ ἂν ἀδικήσαιμι τοὺς διδασκάλους.	0.156
I will not injure my teachers. ~~~ Yes, yes, reverence Paternal Jove.	ναὶ ναὶ καταιδέσθητι πατρῷον Δία.	-0.00775862
Paternal Jove quoth'a!	ἰδού γε Δία πατρῷον·	0.0714286

Why, is there any Jove?	Ζεὺς γάρ τις ἔστιν;	0.09
There is.	ἔστιν.	0.166667
There is not, no; for Vortex reigns having expelled Jupiter.	οὐκ ἔστʼ, οὔκ, ἐπεὶ Δῖνος βασιλεύει τὸν Δίʼ ἐξεληλακώς.	0.0230769
He has not expelled him; but I fancied this, on account of this Vortex here.	οὐκ ἐξελήλακʼ, ἀλλʼ ἐγὼ τοῦτʼ ᾠόμην διὰ τουτονὶ τὸν δῖνον.	0.0857143
Ah me, unhappy man! ~~~ When I even took you who are of earthenware for a god.	οἴμοι δείλαιος ὅτε καὶ σὲ χυτρεοῦν ὄντα θεὸν ἡγησάμην.	-0.0919355
Here rave and babble to yourself.	ἐνταῦθα σαυτῷ παραφρόνει καὶ φληνάφα.	-0.124138
