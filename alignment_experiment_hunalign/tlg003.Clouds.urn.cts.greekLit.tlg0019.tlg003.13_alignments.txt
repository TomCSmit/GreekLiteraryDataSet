I will do so in reliance upon you, for necessity oppresses me, on account of the blood-horses, and the marriage that ruined me. ~~~ Now, therefore, let them use me as they please.	ἡ γὰρ ἀνάγκη με πιέζει διὰ τοὺς ἵππους τοὺς κοππατίας καὶ τὸν γάμον ὅς μʼ ἐπέτριψεν.	-0.00204082
I give up this body to them to be beaten, to be hungered, to be troubled with thirst, to be squalid, to shiver with cold, to flay into a leathern bottle, if I shall escape clear from my debts, and appear to men to be bold, glib of tongue, audacious, impudent, shameless, a fabricator of falsehoods, inventive of words, a practiced knave in lawsuits, a law-tablet, a thorough rattle, a fox, a sharper, a slippery knave, a dissembler, a slippery fellow, an impostor, a gallows-bird, a blackguard, a twister, a troublesome fellow, a licker-up of hashes.	νῦν οὖν ἀτεχνῶς ὅ τι βούλονται τουτὶ τοὐμὸν σῶμʼ αὐτοῖσιν παρέχω, τύπτειν πεινῆν διψῆν αὐχμεῖν ῥιγῶν ἀσκὸν δείρειν, εἴπερ τὰ χρέα διαφευξοῦμαι, τοῖς τʼ ἀνθρώποις εἶναι δόξω θρασὺς εὔγλωττος τολμηρὸς ἴτης βδελυρὸς ψευδῶν συγκολλητὴς εὑρησιεπὴς περίτριμμα δικῶν κύρβις κρόταλον κίναδος τρύμη μάσθλης εἴρων γλοιὸς ἀλαζὼν κέντρων μιαρὸς στρόφις ἀργαλέος ματιολοιχός·	0.1625
If they call me this, when they meet me, let them do to me absolutely what they please. ~~~ And if they like, by Ceres, let them serve up a sausage out of me to the deep thinkers.	ταῦτʼ εἴ με καλοῦσʼ ἁπαντῶντες, δρώντων ἀτεχνῶς ὅ τι χρῄζουσιν, κεἰ βούλονται νὴ τὴν Δήμητρʼ ἔκ μου χορδὴν τοῖς φροντισταῖς παραθέντων.	-0.107746
