For it is proper that we should weep, if we do not act justly.	ἐμοὶ μὲν ὦνδρες ἥλικες δοκεῖ λέγειν δίκαια· κἄμοιγε συγχωρεῖν δοκεῖ τούτοισι τἀπιεικῆ.
Consider still another maxim.	κλάειν γὰρ ἡμᾶς εἰκός ἐστʼ, ἢν μὴ δίκαια δρῶμεν.
No; for I shall perish if I do.	σκέψαι δὲ χἀτέραν ἔτι γνώμην.
And yet perhaps you will not be vexed at suffering what you now suffer.	ἀπὸ γὰρ καὶ μὴν ἴσως γʼ οὐκ ἀχθέσει παθὼν ἃ νῦν πέπονθας.
How, pray?	πῶς δή;
For inform me what good you will do me by this.	δίδαξον γὰρ τί μʼ ἐκ τούτων ἐπωφελήσεις.
I will beat my mother, just as I have you.	τὴν μητέρʼ ὥσπερ καὶ σὲ τυπτήσω.
What do you say?	τί φῄς, τί φῂς σύ;
What do you say?	τοῦθʼ ἕτερον αὖ μεῖζον κακόν.
This other, again, is a greater wickedness.	τί δʼ ἢν ἔχων τὸν ἥττω
