It is your business, old man, to consider in what way you shall conquer the man; for if he were not relying upon something, he would not be so licentious.	σὸν ἔργον ὦ πρεσβῦτα φροντίζειν ὅπῃ τὸν ἄνδρα κρατήσεις, ὡς οὗτος, εἰ μή τῳ ʼπεποίθειν, οὐκ ἂν ἦν οὕτως ἀκόλαστος.
But he is emboldened by something; the boldness of the man is evident.	ἀλλʼ ἔσθʼ ὅτῳ θρασύνεται· δῆλόν γε τἀνθρώπου ʼσʼτὶ τὸ λῆμα.
