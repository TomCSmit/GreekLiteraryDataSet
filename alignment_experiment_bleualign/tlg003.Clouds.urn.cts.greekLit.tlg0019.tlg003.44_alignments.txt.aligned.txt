What then will you say if you be conquered by me in this?	τί μὲν οὖν ἂν ἔτι μεῖζον πάθοι τούτου ποτέ;
I will be silent: what else can I do?	τί δῆτʼ ἐρεῖς, ἢν τοῦτο νικηθῇς ἐμοῦ; σιγήσομαι.
Come, now, tell me; from what class do the advocates come?	τί δʼ ἄλλο; φέρε δή μοι φράσον·
From the blackguards.	συνηγοροῦσιν ἐκ τίνων;
I believe you.	ἐξ εὐρυπρώκτων.
What then?	πείθομαι.
From what class do tragedians come?	τί δαί; τραγῳδοῦσʼ ἐκ τίνων;
From the blackguards.	ἐξ εὐρυπρώκτων.
You say well.	εὖ λέγεις.
But from what class do the public orators come?	δημηγοροῦσι δʼ ἐκ τίνων;
From the blackguards.	ἐξ εὐρυπρώκτων.
Then have you perceived that you say nothing to the purpose?	ἆρα δῆτʼ ἔγνωκας ὡς οὐδὲν λέγεις;
And look which class among the audience is the more numerous.	καὶ τῶν θεατῶν ὁπότεροι πλείους σκόπει.
Well now, I'm looking.	καὶ δὴ σκοπῶ.
What, then, do you see?	τί δῆθʼ ὁρᾷς;
By the gods, the blackguards to be far more numerous.	πολὺ πλείονας νὴ τοὺς θεοὺς τοὺς εὐρυπρώκτους·
This fellow, at any rate, I know; and him yonder; and this fellow with the long hair.	τουτονὶ γοῦν οἶδʼ ἐγὼ κἀκεινονὶ καὶ τὸν κομήτην τουτονί.
What, then, will you say?	τί δῆτʼ ἐρεῖς;
We are conquered.	ἡττήμεθʼ·
Ye blackguards, by the gods, receive my cloak, for I desert to you.	ὦ κινούμενοι πρὸς τῶν θεῶν δέξασθέ μου θοἰμάτιον, ὡς ἐξαυτομολῶ πρὸς ὑμᾶς.
