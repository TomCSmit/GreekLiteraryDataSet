Now meditate and examine closely; and roll yourself about in every way, having wrapped yourself up; and quickly, when you fall into a difficulty, spring to another mental contrivance.	φρόντιζε δὴ καὶ διάθρει πάντα τρόπον τε σαυτὸν στρόβει πυκνώσας. ταχὺς δʼ, ὅταν εἰς ἄπορον πέσῃς, ἐπʼ ἄλλο πήδα νόημα φρενός·
But let delightful sleep be absent from your eyes.	ὕπνος δʼ ἀπέστω γλυκύθυμος ὀμμάτων.
