We have no oil in the lamp.	ἔλαιον ἡμῖν οὐκ ἔνεστʼ ἐν τῷ λύχνῳ.
Ah me!	οἴμοι·
Why did you light the thirsty lamp?	τί γάρ μοι τὸν πότην ἧπτες λύχνον;
Come hither that you may weep!	δεῦρʼ ἔλθʼ ἵνα κλάῃς.
For what, pray, shall I weep?	διὰ τί δῆτα κλαύσομαι;
Because you put in one of the thick wicks.	ὅτι τῶν παχειῶν ἐνετίθεις θρυαλλίδων.
After this, when this son was born to us, to me, forsooth, and to my excellent wife, we squabbled then about the name: for she was for adding hippos to the name, Xanthippus, or Charippus, or Callipides; but I was for giving him the name of his grandfather, Phidonides.	μετὰ ταῦθʼ, ὅπως νῷν ἐγένεθʼ υἱὸς οὑτοσί, ἐμοί τε δὴ καὶ τῇ γυναικὶ τἀγαθῇ, περὶ τοὐνόματος δὴ ʼντεῦθεν ἐλοιδορούμεθα· ἡ μὲν γὰρ ἵππον προσετίθει πρὸς τοὔνομα, Ξάνθιππον ἤ Χαριππον ἢ Καλλιππίδην, ἐγὼ δὲ τοῦ πάππου ʼτιθέμην Φειδωνίδην.
For a time therefore we disputed; and then at length we agreed, and called him Phidippides.	τέως μὲν οὖν ἐκρινόμεθʼ· εἶτα τῷ χρόνῳ κοινῇ ξυνέβημεν κἀθέμεθα Φειδιππίδην.
She used to take this son and fondle him, saying, When you, being grown up, shall drive your chariot to the city, like Megacles, with a xystis.	τοῦτον τὸν υἱὸν λαμβάνουσʼ ἐκορίζετο, ὅταν σὺ μέγας ὢν ἅρμʼ ἐλαύνῃς πρὸς πόλιν, ὥσπερ Μεγακλέης, ξυστίδʼ ἔχων.
But I used to say, Nay, rather, when dressed in a leathern jerkin, you shall drive goats from Phelleus, like your father.	ἐγὼ δʼ ἔφην, ὅταν μὲν οὖν τὰς αἶγας ἐκ τοῦ φελλέως, ὥσπερ ὁ πατήρ σου, διφθέραν ἐνημμένος.
He paid no attention to my words, but poured a horse-fever over my property.	ἀλλʼ οὐκ ἐπίθετο τοῖς ἐμοῖς οὐδὲν λόγοις, ἀλλʼ ἵππερόν μου κατέχεεν τῶν χρημάτων.
Now, therefore, by meditating the whole night, I have discovered one path for my course extraordinarily excellent; to which if I persuade this youth I shall be saved.	νῦν οὖν ὅλην τὴν νύκτα φροντίζων ὁδοῦ μίαν ηὗρον ἀτραπὸν δαιμονίως ὑπερφυᾶ, ἣν ἢν ἀναπείσω τουτονί, σωθήσομαι.
But first I wish to awake him.	ἀλλʼ ἐξεγεῖραι πρῶτον αὐτὸν βούλομαι.
How then can I awake him in the most agreeable manner?	πῶς δῆτʼ ἂν ἥδιστʼ αὐτὸν ἐπεγείραιμι;
How?	πῶς;
Phidippides, my little Phidippides?	Φειδιππίδη Φειδιππίδιον.
What, father?	τί ὦ πάτερ;
Kiss me, and give me your right hand!	κύσον με καὶ τὴν χεῖρα δὸς τὴν δεξιάν.
There.	ἰδού.
What's the matter?	τί ἔστιν;
Tell me, do you love me?	εἰπέ μοι, φιλεῖς ἐμέ;
Yes, by this Equestrian Neptune.	νὴ τὸν Ποσειδῶ τουτονὶ τὸν ἵππιον.
Nay, do not by any means mention this Equestrian to me, for this god is the author of my misfortunes.	μὴ ʼμοί γε τοῦτον μηδαμῶς τὸν ἵππιον· οὗτος γὰρ ὁ θεὸς αἴτιός μοι τῶν κακῶν.
But, if you really love me from your heart, my son, obey me.	ἀλλʼ εἴπερ ἐκ τῆς καρδίας μʼ ὄντως φιλεῖς, ὦ παῖ πιθοῦ.
In what then, pray, shall I obey you?	τί οὖν πίθωμαι δῆτά σοι;
Reform your habits as quickly as possible, and go and learn what I advise.	ἔκστρεψον ὡς τάχιστα τοὺς σαυτοῦ τρόπους, καὶ μάνθανʼ ἐλθὼν ἃν ἐγὼ παραινέσω.
