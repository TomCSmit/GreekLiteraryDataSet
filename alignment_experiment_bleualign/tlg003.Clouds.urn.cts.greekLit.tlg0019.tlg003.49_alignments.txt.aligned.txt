Then I will shout with a very loud shout: Ho!	βοάσομαί τἄρα τὰν ὑπέρτονον βοάν.
Weep, you petty-usurers, both you and your principals, and your compound interests!	ἰὼ κλάετʼ ὦ ʼβολοστάται αὐτοί τε καὶ τἀρχαῖα καὶ τόκοι τόκων·
For you can no longer do me any harm, because such a son is being reared for me in this house, shining with a double-edged tongue, for my guardian, the preserver of my house, a mischief to my enemies, ending the sadness of the great woes of his father.	οὐδὲν γὰρ ἄν με φλαῦρον ἐργάσαισθʼ ἔτι, οἷος ἐμοὶ τρέφεται τοῖσδʼ ἐνὶ δώμασι παῖς, ἀμφήκει γλώττῃ λάμπων, πρόβολος ἐμός, σωτὴρ δόμοις, ἐχθροῖς βλάβη, λυσανίας πατρῴων μεγάλων κακῶν·
Him do thou run and summon from within to me. O child!	ὃν κάλεσον τρέχων ἔνδοθεν ὡς ἐμέ.
O son! Come forth from the house!	ὦ τέκνον ὦ παῖ ἔξελθʼ οἴκων, ἄιε σοῦ πατρός.
Hear your father! Lo, here is the man!	ὅδʼ ἐκεῖνος ἀνήρ.
O my dear, my dear!	ὦ φίλος ὦ φίλος.
Take your son and depart.	ἄπιθι συλλαβών.
