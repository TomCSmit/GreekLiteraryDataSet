For every one to whom I happen to be indebted, swears, and says he will ruin and destroy me, having made his deposits against me; though I only ask what is moderate and just- My good sir, one part don't take just now; the other part put off I pray; and the other part remit ; they say that thus they will never get back their money, but abuse me, as I am unjust, and say they will go to law with me.	πέμπτη, τετράς, τρίτη, μετὰ ταύτην δευτέρα, εἶθʼ ἣν ἐγὼ μάλιστα πασῶν ἡμερῶν δέδοικα καὶ πέφρικα καὶ βδελύττομαι, εὐθὺς μετὰ ταύτην ἔσθʼ ἕνη τε καὶ νέα. πᾶς γάρ τις ὀμνὺς οἷς ὀφείλων τυγχάνω, θείς μοι πρυτανεῖʼ ἀπολεῖν μέ φησι κἀξολεῖν, κἀμοῦ μέτριά τε καὶ δίκαιʼ αἰτουμένου, ὦ δαιμόνιε τὸ μέν τι νυνὶ μὴ λάβῃς, τὸ δʼ ἀναβαλοῦ μοι, τὸ δʼ ἄφες , οὔ φασίν ποτε οὕτως ἀπολήψεσθʼ, ἀλλὰ λοιδοροῦσί με ὡς ἄδικός εἰμι, καὶ δικάσεσθαί φασί μοι.
Now therefore let them go to law, for it little concerns me, if Phidippides has learned to speak well.	νῦν οὖν δικαζέσθων· ὀλίγον γάρ μοι μέλει, εἴπερ μεμάθηκεν εὖ λέγειν Φειδιππίδης.
I shall soon know by knocking at the thinking-shop.	τάχα δʼ εἴσομαι κόψας τὸ φροντιστήριον.
Boy, I say! Boy, boy!	παῖ, ἠμί, παῖ παῖ.
Good morning, Strepsiades.	Στρεψιάδην ἀσπάζομαι.
The same to you.	κἄγωγέ σʼ·
But first accept this present; for one ought to compliment the teacher with a fee.	ἀλλὰ τουτονὶ πρῶτον λαβέ· χρὴ γὰρ ἐπιθαυμάζειν τι τὸν διδάσκαλον.
And tell me about my son, if he has learned that cause, which you just now brought forward.	καί μοι τὸν υἱὸν εἰ μεμάθηκε τὸν λόγον ἐκεῖνον εἴφʼ ὃν ἀρτίως εἰσήγαγες.
He has learned it.	μεμάθηκεν.
Well done, O Fraud, all-powerful queen!	εὖ γʼ ὦ παμβασίλειʼ Ἀπαιόλη.
So that you can get clear off from whatever suit you please.	ὥστʼ ἀποφύγοις ἂν ἥντινʼ ἂν βούλῃ δίκην.
Even if witnesses were present when I borrowed the money?	κεἰ μάρτυρες παρῆσαν, ὅτʼ ἐδανειζόμην;
Yea, much more! Even if a thousand be present.	πολλῷ γε μᾶλλον, κἂν παρῶσι χίλιοι.
