This man has a spirit not void of courage, but prompt.	λῆμα μὲν πάρεστι τῷδέ γʼ οὐκ ἄτολμον ἀλλʼ ἕτοιμον.
Know, that if you learn these matters from me, you will possess among mortals a glory as high as heaven.	ἴσθι δʼ ὡς ταῦτα μαθὼν παρʼ ἐμοῦ κλέος οὐρανόμηκες ἐν βροτοῖσιν ἕξεις.
What shall I experience?	τί πείσομαι;
You shall pass with me the most enviable of mortal lives the whole time.	τὸν πάντα χρόνον μετʼ ἐμοῦ ζηλωτότατον βίον ἀνθρώπων διάξεις.
Shall I then ever see this?	ἆρά γε τοῦτʼ ἄρʼ ἐγώ ποτʼ ὄψομαι;
Yea, so that many be always seated at your gates, wishing to communicate with you and come to a conference with you, to consult with you as to actions and affidavits of many talents, as is worthy of your abilities.	ὥστε γέ σου πολλοὺς ἐπὶ ταῖσι θύραις ἀεὶ καθῆσθαι, βουλομένους ἀνακοινοῦσθαί τε καὶ ἐς λόγον ἐλθεῖν πράγματα κἀντιγραφὰς πολλῶν ταλάντων, ἄξια σῇ φρενὶ συμβουλευσομένους μετὰ σοῦ.
