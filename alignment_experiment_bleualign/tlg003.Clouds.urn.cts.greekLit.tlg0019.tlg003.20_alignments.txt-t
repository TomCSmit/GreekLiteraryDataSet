Most clever spectators, come, give us your attention; for having been injured, we blame you to your faces.
For though we benefit the state most of all the gods, to us alone of the deities you do not offer sacrifice nor yet pour libations, who watch over you.
For if there should be any expedition without prudence, then we either thunder or drizzle small rain.
And then, when you were for choosing as your general the Paphlagonian tanner, hateful to the gods, we contracted our brows and were enraged; and thunder burst through the lightning; and the Moon forsook her usual paths; and the Sun immediately drew in his wick to himself, and declared he would not give you light, if Cleon should be your general.
Nevertheless you chose him.
For they say that ill counsel is in this city; that the gods, however, turn all these your mismanagements to a prosperous issue.
And how this also shall be advantageous, we will easily teach you.
If you should convict the cormorant Cleon of bribery and embezzlement, and then make fast his neck in the stocks, the affair will turn out for the state to the ancient form again, if you have mismanaged in any way, and to a prosperous issue.
