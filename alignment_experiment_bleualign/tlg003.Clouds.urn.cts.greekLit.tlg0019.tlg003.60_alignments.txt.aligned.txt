But you now, throttling me who was bawling and crying out because I wanted to ease myself, had not the heart to carry me forth out of doors, you wretch; but I did it there while I was being throttled.	βοῶντα καὶ κεκραγόθʼ ὅτι χεζητιῴην, οὐκ ἔτλης ἔξω ʼξενεγκεῖν ὦ μιαρὲ θύραζέ μʼ, ἀλλὰ πνιγόμενος αὐτοῦ ʼποίησα κακκᾶν.
