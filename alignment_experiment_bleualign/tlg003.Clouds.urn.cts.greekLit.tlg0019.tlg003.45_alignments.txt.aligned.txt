What then?	τί δῆτα;
whether do you wish to take and lead away this your son, or shall I teach him to speak?	πότερα τοῦτον ἀπάγεσθαι λαβὼν βούλει τὸν υἱόν, ἢ διδάσκω σοι λέγειν;
Teach him, and chastise him: and remember that you train him properly; on the one side able for petty suits; but train his other jaw able for the more important causes.	δίδασκε καὶ κόλαζε καὶ μέμνησʼ ὅπως εὖ μοι στομώσεις αὐτόν, ἐπὶ μὲν θάτερα οἷον δικιδίοις, τὴν δʼ ἑτέραν αὐτοῦ γνάθον στόμωσον οἵαν ἐς τὰ μείζω πράγματα.
Make yourself easy; you shall receive him back a clever sophist.	ἀμέλει κομιεῖ τοῦτον σοφιστὴν δεξιόν.
Nay, rather, pale and wretched.	ὠχρὸν μὲν οὖν οἶμαί γε καὶ κακοδαίμονα.
