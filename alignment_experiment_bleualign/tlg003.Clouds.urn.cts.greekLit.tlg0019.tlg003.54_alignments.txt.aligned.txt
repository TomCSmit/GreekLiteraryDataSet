What a thing it is to love evil courses!	οἷον τὸ πραγμάτων ἐρᾶν φλαύρων·
For this old man, having loved them, wishes to withhold the money that he borrowed.	ὁ γὰρ γέρων ὅδʼ ἐρασθεὶς ἀποστερῆσαι βούλεται τὰ χρήμαθʼ ἁδανείσατο·
And he will certainly meet with something today, which will perhaps cause this sophist to suddenly receive some misfortune, in return for the knaveries he has begun.	κοὐκ ἔσθʼ ὅπως οὐ τήμερον λήψεταί τι πρᾶγμʼ, ὃ τοῦτον ποιήσει τὸν σοφιστὴν ἀνθʼ ὧν πανουργεῖν ἤρξατʼ, ἐξαίφνης λαβεῖν κακόν τι.
