Nay, rather, you are yourself the cause of these things, having turned yourself to wicked courses.	αὐτὸς μὲν οὖν σαυτῷ σὺ τούτων αἴτιος, στρέψας σεαυτὸν ἐς πονηρὰ πράγματα.
Why, pray, did you not tell me this, then, but excited with hopes a rustic and aged man?	τί δῆτα ταῦτʼ οὔ μοι τότʼ ἠγορεύετε, ἀλλʼ ἄνδρʼ ἄγροικον καὶ γέροντʼ ἐπῄρετε;
We always do this to him whom we perceive to be a lover of wicked courses, until we precipitate him into misfortune, so that he may learn to fear the gods.	ἡμεῖς ποιοῦμεν ταῦθʼ ἑκάστοθʼ ὅταν τινὰ γνῶμεν πονηρῶν ὄντʼ ἐραστὴν πραγμάτων, ἕως ἂν αὐτὸν ἐμβάλωμεν ἐς κακόν, ὅπως ἂν εἰδῇ τοὺς θεοὺς δεδοικέναι.
Ah me ! it is severe, O Clouds!	ὤμοι πονηρά γʼ ὦ Νεφέλαι, δίκαια δέ.
But it is just; for I ought not to have withheld the money which I borrowed.	οὐ γάρ μʼ ἐχρῆν τὰ χρήμαθʼ ἁδανεισάμην ἀποστερεῖν.
Now, therefore, come with me, my dearest son, that you may destroy the blackguard Chaerephon and Socrates, who deceived you and me.	νῦν οὖν ὅπως ὦ φίλτατε τὸν Χαιρεφῶντα τὸν μιαρὸν καὶ Σωκράτη ἀπολεῖς μετʼ ἐμοῦ ʼλθών, οἳ σὲ κἄμʼ ἐξηπάτων.
I will not injure my teachers.	ἀλλʼ οὐκ ἂν ἀδικήσαιμι τοὺς διδασκάλους.
Yes, yes, reverence Paternal Jove.	ναὶ ναὶ καταιδέσθητι πατρῷον Δία.
Paternal Jove quoth'a!	ἰδού γε Δία πατρῷον·
How antiquated you are!	ὡς ἀρχαῖος εἶ.
Why, is there any Jove?	Ζεὺς γάρ τις ἔστιν;
There is.	ἔστιν.
There is not, no; for Vortex reigns having expelled Jupiter.	οὐκ ἔστʼ, οὔκ, ἐπεὶ Δῖνος βασιλεύει τὸν Δίʼ ἐξεληλακώς.
He has not expelled him; but I fancied this, on account of this Vortex here.	οὐκ ἐξελήλακʼ, ἀλλʼ ἐγὼ τοῦτʼ ᾠόμην διὰ τουτονὶ τὸν δῖνον.
Ah me, unhappy man! When I even took you who are of earthenware for a god.	οἴμοι δείλαιος ὅτε καὶ σὲ χυτρεοῦν ὄντα θεὸν ἡγησάμην.
Here rave and babble to yourself.	ἐνταῦθα σαυτῷ παραφρόνει καὶ φληνάφα.
