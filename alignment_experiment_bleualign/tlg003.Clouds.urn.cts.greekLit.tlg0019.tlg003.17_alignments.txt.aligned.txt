Well, go in peace, for the sake of this your valour.	ἀλλʼ ἴθι χαίρων τῆς ἀνδρείας οὕνεκα ταύτης.
May prosperity attend the man, because, being advanced into the vale of years, he imbues his intellect with modern subjects, and cultivates wisdom!	εὐτυχία γένοιτο τἀνθρώπῳ, ὅτι προήκων ἐς βαθὺ τῆς ἡλικίας νεωτέροις τὴν φύσιν αὑτοῦ πράγμασιν χρωτίζεται καὶ σοφίαν ἐπασκεῖ.
