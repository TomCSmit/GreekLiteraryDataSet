How sweetly does a modest grace attend your words!	ὦ καλλίπυργον σοφίαν κλεινοτάτην ἐπασκῶν, ὡς ἡδύ σου τοῖσι λόγοις σῶφρον ἔπεστιν ἄνθος.
Happy, therefore, were they who lived in those days, in the times of former men!	†εὐδαίμονες δʼ ἦσαν ἄρʼ οἱ ζῶντες τότʼ ἐπὶ τῶν προτέρων†·
In reply, then, to these, O thou that hast a dainty-seeming Muse, it behooveth thee to say something new; since the man has gained renown.	πρὸς τάδε σʼ ὦ κομψοπρεπῆ μοῦσαν ἔχων, δεῖ σε λέγειν τι καινόν, ὡς ηὐδοκίμηκεν ἁνήρ.
