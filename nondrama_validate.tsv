 seeking to win his own life and the return of his comrades. Yet even so he saved not his comrades, though he desired it sore, for through their own blind folly they perished—fools, who devoured the kine of Helios Hyperion; but he took from them the day of their returning.	ἄνδρα μοι ἔννεπε, μοῦσα, πολύτροπον, ὃς μάλα πολλὰ πλάγχθη, ἐπεὶ Τροίης ἱερὸν πτολίεθρον ἔπερσεν· πολλῶν δʼ ἀνθρώπων ἴδεν ἄστεα καὶ νόον ἔγνω, πολλὰ δʼ ὅ γʼ ἐν πόντῳ πάθεν ἄλγεα ὃν κατὰ θυμόν,
Of these things, goddess, daughter of Zeus, beginning where thou wilt, tell thou even unto us. Now all the rest, as many as had escaped sheer destruction, were at home, safe from both war and sea, but Odysseus alone, filled with longing for his return and for his wife, did the queenly nymph Calypso, that bright goddess,	ἀρνύμενος ἥν τε ψυχὴν καὶ νόστον ἑταίρων. ἀλλʼ οὐδʼ ὣς ἑτάρους ἐρρύσατο, ἱέμενός περ· αὐτῶν γὰρ σφετέρῃσιν ἀτασθαλίῃσιν ὄλοντο, νήπιοι, οἳ κατὰ βοῦς Ὑπερίονος Ἠελίοιο ἤσθιον· αὐτὰρ ὁ τοῖσιν ἀφείλετο νόστιμον ἦμαρ.
keep back in her hollow caves, yearning that he should be her husband. But when, as the seasons revolved, the year came in which the gods had ordained that he should return home to Ithaca , not even there was he free from toils, even among his own folk. And all the gods pitied him	τῶν ἁμόθεν γε, θεά, θύγατερ Διός, εἰπὲ καὶ ἡμῖν. ἔνθʼ ἄλλοι μὲν πάντες, ὅσοι φύγον αἰπὺν ὄλεθρον, οἴκοι ἔσαν, πόλεμόν τε πεφευγότες ἠδὲ θάλασσαν· τὸν δʼ οἶον νόστου κεχρημένον ἠδὲ γυναικὸς νύμφη πότνιʼ ἔρυκε Καλυψὼ δῖα θεάων
save Poseidon; but he continued to rage unceasingly against godlike Odysseus until at length he reached his own land. Howbeit Poseidon had gone among the far-off Ethiopians—the Ethiopians who dwell sundered in twain, the farthermost of men, some where Hyperion sets and some where he rises,	ἐν σπέσσι γλαφυροῖσι, λιλαιομένη πόσιν εἶναι. ἀλλʼ ὅτε δὴ ἔτος ἦλθε περιπλομένων ἐνιαυτῶν, τῷ οἱ ἐπεκλώσαντο θεοὶ οἶκόνδε νέεσθαι εἰς Ἰθάκην, οὐδʼ ἔνθα πεφυγμένος ἦεν ἀέθλων καὶ μετὰ οἷσι φίλοισι. θεοὶ δʼ ἐλέαιρον ἅπαντες
 there to receive a hecatomb of bulls and rams, and there he was taking his joy, sitting at the feast; but the other gods were gathered together in the halls of Olympian Zeus. Among them the father of gods and men was first to speak, for in his heart he thought of noble Aegisthus,	νόσφι Ποσειδάωνος· ὁ δʼ ἀσπερχὲς μενέαινεν ἀντιθέῳ Ὀδυσῆι πάρος ἣν γαῖαν ἱκέσθαι. ἀλλʼ ὁ μὲν Αἰθίοπας μετεκίαθε τηλόθʼ ἐόντας, Αἰθίοπας τοὶ διχθὰ δεδαίαται, ἔσχατοι ἀνδρῶν, οἱ μὲν δυσομένου Ὑπερίονος οἱ δʼ ἀνιόντος,
whom far-famed Orestes, Agamemnon's son, had slain. Thinking on him he spoke among the immortals, and said: “Look you now, how ready mortals are to blame the gods. It is from us, they say, that evils come, but they even of themselves, through their own blind folly, have sorrows beyond that which is ordained.	ἀντιόων ταύρων τε καὶ ἀρνειῶν ἑκατόμβης. ἔνθʼ ὅ γʼ ἐτέρπετο δαιτὶ παρήμενος· οἱ δὲ δὴ ἄλλοι Ζηνὸς ἐνὶ μεγάροισιν Ὀλυμπίου ἁθρόοι ἦσαν. τοῖσι δὲ μύθων ἦρχε πατὴρ ἀνδρῶν τε θεῶν τε· μνήσατο γὰρ κατὰ θυμὸν ἀμύμονος Αἰγίσθοιο,
Even as now Aegisthus, beyond that which was ordained, took to himself the wedded wife of the son of Atreus, and slew him on his return, though well he knew of sheer destruction, seeing that we spake to him before, sending Hermes, the keen-sighted Argeiphontes, that he should neither slay the man nor woo his wife;	τόν ῥʼ Ἀγαμεμνονίδης τηλεκλυτὸς ἔκτανʼ Ὀρέστης· τοῦ ὅ γʼ ἐπιμνησθεὶς ἔπεʼ ἀθανάτοισι μετηύδα· ὢ πόποι, οἷον δή νυ θεοὺς βροτοὶ αἰτιόωνται· ἐξ ἡμέων γάρ φασι κάκʼ ἔμμεναι, οἱ δὲ καὶ αὐτοὶ σφῇσιν ἀτασθαλίῃσιν ὑπὲρ μόρον ἄλγεʼ ἔχουσιν,
for from Orestes shall come vengeance for the son of Atreus when once he has come to manhood and longs for his own land. So Hermes spoke, but for all his good intent he prevailed not upon the heart of Aegisthus; and now he has paid the full price of all.” Then the goddess, flashing-eyed Athena, answered him:	ὡς καὶ νῦν Αἴγισθος ὑπὲρ μόρον Ἀτρεΐδαο γῆμʼ ἄλοχον μνηστήν, τὸν δʼ ἔκτανε νοστήσαντα, εἰδὼς αἰπὺν ὄλεθρον, ἐπεὶ πρό οἱ εἴπομεν ἡμεῖς, Ἑρμείαν πέμψαντες, ἐύσκοπον ἀργεϊφόντην, μήτʼ αὐτὸν κτείνειν μήτε μνάασθαι ἄκοιτιν·
 “Father of us all, thou son of Cronos, high above all lords, aye, verily that man lies low in a destruction that is his due; so, too, may any other also be destroyed who does such deeds. But my heart is torn for wise Odysseus, hapless man, who far from his friends has long been suffering woes	ἐκ γὰρ Ὀρέσταο τίσις ἔσσεται Ἀτρεΐδαο, ὁππότʼ ἂν ἡβήσῃ τε καὶ ἧς ἱμείρεται αἴης. ὣς ἔφαθʼ Ἑρμείας, ἀλλʼ οὐ φρένας Αἰγίσθοιο πεῖθʼ ἀγαθὰ φρονέων· νῦν δʼ ἁθρόα πάντʼ ἀπέτισεν. τὸν δʼ ἠμείβετʼ ἔπειτα θεά, γλαυκῶπις Ἀθήνη·
 in a sea-girt isle, where is the navel of the sea. 'Tis a wooded isle, and therein dwells a goddess, daughter of Atlas of baneful mind, who knows the depths of every sea, and himself holds the tall pillars which keep earth and heaven apart.	ὦ πάτερ ἡμέτερε Κρονίδη, ὕπατε κρειόντων, καὶ λίην κεῖνός γε ἐοικότι κεῖται ὀλέθρῳ· ὡς ἀπόλοιτο καὶ ἄλλος, ὅτις τοιαῦτά γε ῥέζοι· ἀλλά μοι ἀμφʼ Ὀδυσῆι δαΐφρονι δαίεται ἦτορ, δυσμόρῳ, ὃς δὴ δηθὰ φίλων ἄπο πήματα πάσχει
His daughter it is that keeps back that wretched, sorrowing man; and ever with soft and wheedling words she beguiles him that he may forget Ithaca . But Odysseus, in his longing to see were it but the smoke leaping up from his own land, yearns to die. Yet thy	νήσῳ ἐν ἀμφιρύτῃ, ὅθι τʼ ὀμφαλός ἐστι θαλάσσης. νῆσος δενδρήεσσα, θεὰ δʼ ἐν δώματα ναίει, Ἄτλαντος θυγάτηρ ὀλοόφρονος, ὅς τε θαλάσσης πάσης βένθεα οἶδεν, ἔχει δέ τε κίονας αὐτὸς μακράς, αἳ γαῖάν τε καὶ οὐρανὸν ἀμφὶς ἔχουσιν.
heart doth not regard it, Olympian. Did not Odysseus beside the ships of the Argives offer thee sacrifice without stint in the broad land of Troy ? Wherefore then didst thou conceive such wrath against him, O Zeus?” Then Zeus, the cloud-gatherer, answered her and said: “My child, what a word has escaped the barrier of thy teeth?	τοῦ θυγάτηρ δύστηνον ὀδυρόμενον κατερύκει, αἰεὶ δὲ μαλακοῖσι καὶ αἱμυλίοισι λόγοισιν θέλγει, ὅπως Ἰθάκης ἐπιλήσεται· αὐτὰρ Ὀδυσσεύς, ἱέμενος καὶ καπνὸν ἀποθρῴσκοντα νοῆσαι ἧς γαίης, θανέειν ἱμείρεται. οὐδέ νυ σοί περ
 How should I, then, forget godlike Odysseus, who is beyond all mortals in wisdom, and beyond all has paid sacrifice to the immortal gods, who hold broad heaven? Nay, it is Poseidon, the earth-enfolder, who is ever filled with stubborn wrath because of the Cyclops, whom Odysseus blinded of his eye—	ἐντρέπεται φίλον ἦτορ, Ὀλύμπιε. οὔ νύ τʼ Ὀδυσσεὺς Ἀργείων παρὰ νηυσὶ χαρίζετο ἱερὰ ῥέζων Τροίῃ ἐν εὐρείῃ; τί νύ οἱ τόσον ὠδύσαο, Ζεῦ; τὴν δʼ ἀπαμειβόμενος προσέφη νεφεληγερέτα Ζεύς· τέκνον ἐμόν, ποῖόν σε ἔπος φύγεν ἕρκος ὀδόντων.
even the godlike Polyphemus, whose might is greatest among all the Cyclopes; and the nymph Thoosa bore him, daughter of Phorcys who rules over the unresting sea; for in the hollow caves she lay with Poseidon. From that time forth Poseidon, the earth-shaker,	πῶς ἂν ἔπειτʼ Ὀδυσῆος ἐγὼ θείοιο λαθοίμην, ὃς περὶ μὲν νόον ἐστὶ βροτῶν, περὶ δʼ ἱρὰ θεοῖσιν ἀθανάτοισιν ἔδωκε, τοὶ οὐρανὸν εὐρὺν ἔχουσιν; ἀλλὰ Ποσειδάων γαιήοχος ἀσκελὲς αἰεὶ Κύκλωπος κεχόλωται, ὃν ὀφθαλμοῦ ἀλάωσεν,
does not indeed slay Odysseus, but makes him a wanderer from his native land. But come, let us who are here all take thought of his return, that he may come home; and Poseidon will let go his anger, for he will in no wise be able, against all the immortal gods and in their despite, to contend alone.”	ἀντίθεον Πολύφημον, ὅου κράτος ἐστὶ μέγιστον πᾶσιν Κυκλώπεσσι· Θόωσα δέ μιν τέκε νύμφη, Φόρκυνος θυγάτηρ ἁλὸς ἀτρυγέτοιο μέδοντος, ἐν σπέσσι γλαφυροῖσι Ποσειδάωνι μιγεῖσα. ἐκ τοῦ δὴ Ὀδυσῆα Ποσειδάων ἐνοσίχθων
 Then the goddess, flashing-eyed Athena, answered him: “Father of us all, thou son of Cronos, high above all lords, if indeed this is now well pleasing to the blessed gods, that the wise Odysseus should return to his own home, let us send forth Hermes, the messenger, Argeiphontes,	οὔ τι κατακτείνει, πλάζει δʼ ἀπὸ πατρίδος αἴης. ἀλλʼ ἄγεθʼ, ἡμεῖς οἵδε περιφραζώμεθα πάντες νόστον, ὅπως ἔλθῃσι· Ποσειδάων δὲ μεθήσει ὃν χόλον· οὐ μὲν γάρ τι δυνήσεται ἀντία πάντων ἀθανάτων ἀέκητι θεῶν ἐριδαινέμεν οἶος.
to call to an assembly the long-haired Achaeans, and speak out his word to all the wooers, who are ever slaying his thronging sheep and his sleek kine of shambling gait. And I will guide him to Sparta and to sandy Pylos , to seek tidings of the return of his dear father, if haply he may hear of it,	τὸν δʼ ἠμείβετʼ ἔπειτα θεά, γλαυκῶπις Ἀθήνη· ὦ πάτερ ἡμέτερε Κρονίδη, ὕπατε κρειόντων, εἰ μὲν δὴ νῦν τοῦτο φίλον μακάρεσσι θεοῖσιν, νοστῆσαι Ὀδυσῆα πολύφρονα ὅνδε δόμονδε, Ἑρμείαν μὲν ἔπειτα διάκτορον ἀργεϊφόντην
that good report may be his among men.” So she spoke, and bound beneath her feet her beautiful sandals, immortal, golden, which were wont to bear her both over the waters of the sea and over the boundless land swift as the blasts of the wind. And she took her mighty spear, tipped with sharp bronze,	νῆσον ἐς Ὠγυγίην ὀτρύνομεν, ὄφρα τάχιστα νύμφῃ ἐυπλοκάμῳ εἴπῃ νημερτέα βουλήν, νόστον Ὀδυσσῆος ταλασίφρονος, ὥς κε νέηται· αὐτὰρ ἐγὼν Ἰθάκηνδʼ ἐσελεύσομαι, ὄφρα οἱ υἱὸν μᾶλλον ἐποτρύνω καί οἱ μένος ἐν φρεσὶ θείω,
heavy and huge and strong, wherewith she vanquishes the ranks of men—of warriors, with whom she is wroth, she, the daughter of the mighty sire. Then she went darting down from the heights of Olympus , and took her stand in the land of Ithaca at the outer gate of Odysseus, on the threshold of the court. In her hand she held the spear of bronze,	εἰς ἀγορὴν καλέσαντα κάρη κομόωντας Ἀχαιοὺς πᾶσι μνηστήρεσσιν ἀπειπέμεν, οἵ τέ οἱ αἰεὶ μῆλʼ ἁδινὰ σφάζουσι καὶ εἰλίποδας ἕλικας βοῦς. πέμψω δʼ ἐς Σπάρτην τε καὶ ἐς Πύλον ἠμαθόεντα νόστον πευσόμενον πατρὸς φίλου, ἤν που ἀκούσῃ,
and she was in the likeness of a stranger, Mentes, the leader of the Taphians. There she found the proud wooers. They were taking their pleasure at draughts in front of the doors, sitting on the hides of oxen which they themselves had slain; and of the heralds and busy squires,	ἠδʼ ἵνα μιν κλέος ἐσθλὸν ἐν ἀνθρώποισιν ἔχῃσιν. ὣς εἰποῦσʼ ὑπὸ ποσσὶν ἐδήσατο καλὰ πέδιλα, ἀμβρόσια χρύσεια, τά μιν φέρον ἠμὲν ἐφʼ ὑγρὴν ἠδʼ ἐπʼ ἀπείρονα γαῖαν ἅμα πνοιῇς ἀνέμοιο· εἵλετο δʼ ἄλκιμον ἔγχος, ἀκαχμένον ὀξέι χαλκῷ,
some were mixing wine and water for them in bowls, others again were washing the tables with porous sponges and setting them forth, while still others were portioning out meats in abundance. Her the godlike Telemachus was far the first to see, for he was sitting among the wooers, sad at heart,	βριθὺ μέγα στιβαρόν, τῷ δάμνησι στίχας ἀνδρῶν ἡρώων, τοῖσίν τε κοτέσσεται ὀβριμοπάτρη. βῆ δὲ κατʼ Οὐλύμποιο καρήνων ἀίξασα, στῆ δʼ Ἰθάκης ἐνὶ δήμῳ ἐπὶ προθύροις Ὀδυσῆος, οὐδοῦ ἐπʼ αὐλείου· παλάμῃ δʼ ἔχε χάλκεον ἔγχος,
 seeing in thought his noble father, should he perchance come from somewhere and make a scattering of the wooers in the palace, and himself win honor and rule over his own house. As he thought of these things, sitting among the wooers, he beheld Athena, and he went straight to the outer door; for in his heart he counted it shame	εἰδομένη ξείνῳ, Ταφίων ἡγήτορι Μέντῃ. εὗρε δʼ ἄρα μνηστῆρας ἀγήνορας. οἱ μὲν ἔπειτα πεσσοῖσι προπάροιθε θυράων θυμὸν ἔτερπον ἥμενοι ἐν ῥινοῖσι βοῶν, οὓς ἔκτανον αὐτοί· κήρυκες δʼ αὐτοῖσι καὶ ὀτρηροὶ θεράποντες
that a stranger should stand long at the gates. So, drawing near, he clasped her right hand, and took from her the spear of bronze; and he spoke, and addressed her with winged words: “Hail, stranger; in our house thou shalt find entertainment and then, when thou hast tasted food, thou shalt tell of what thou hast need.”	οἱ μὲν οἶνον ἔμισγον ἐνὶ κρητῆρσι καὶ ὕδωρ, οἱ δʼ αὖτε σπόγγοισι πολυτρήτοισι τραπέζας νίζον καὶ πρότιθεν, τοὶ δὲ κρέα πολλὰ δατεῦντο. τὴν δὲ πολὺ πρῶτος ἴδε Τηλέμαχος θεοειδής, ἧστο γὰρ ἐν μνηστῆρσι φίλον τετιημένος ἦτορ,
 So saying, he led the way, and Pallas Athena followed. And when they were within the lofty house, he bore the spear and set it against a tall pillar in a polished spear-rack, where were set many spears besides, even those of Odysseus of the steadfast heart.	ὀσσόμενος πατέρʼ ἐσθλὸν ἐνὶ φρεσίν, εἴ ποθεν ἐλθὼν μνηστήρων τῶν μὲν σκέδασιν κατὰ δώματα θείη, τιμὴν δʼ αὐτὸς ἔχοι καὶ δώμασιν οἷσιν ἀνάσσοι. τὰ φρονέων, μνηστῆρσι μεθήμενος, εἴσιδʼ Ἀθήνην. βῆ δʼ ἰθὺς προθύροιο, νεμεσσήθη δʼ ἐνὶ θυμῷ
Athena herself he led and seated on a chair, spreading a linen cloth beneath—a beautiful chair, richly-wrought, and below was a footstool for the feet. Beside it he placed for himself an inlaid seat, apart from the others, the wooers, lest the stranger, vexed by their din, should loathe the meal, seeing that he was in the company of overweening men;	ξεῖνον δηθὰ θύρῃσιν ἐφεστάμεν· ἐγγύθι δὲ στὰς χεῖρʼ ἕλε δεξιτερὴν καὶ ἐδέξατο χάλκεον ἔγχος, καί μιν φωνήσας ἔπεα πτερόεντα προσηύδα· χαῖρε, ξεῖνε, παρʼ ἄμμι φιλήσεαι· αὐτὰρ ἔπειτα δείπνου πασσάμενος μυθήσεαι ὅττεό σε χρή.
 and also that he might ask him about his father that was gone. Then a handmaid brought water for the hands in a fair pitcher of gold, and poured it over a silver basin for them to wash, and beside them drew up a polished table. And the grave housewife brought and set before them bread,	ὣς εἰπὼν ἡγεῖθʼ, ἡ δʼ ἕσπετο Παλλὰς Ἀθήνη. οἱ δʼ ὅτε δή ῥʼ ἔντοσθεν ἔσαν δόμου ὑψηλοῖο, ἔγχος μέν ῥʼ ἔστησε φέρων πρὸς κίονα μακρὴν δουροδόκης ἔντοσθεν ἐυξόου, ἔνθα περ ἄλλα ἔγχεʼ Ὀδυσσῆος ταλασίφρονος ἵστατο πολλά,
and therewith dainties in abundance, giving freely of her store. And a carver lifted up and placed before them platters of all manner of meats, and set by them golden goblets, while a herald ever walked to and fro pouring them wine. Then in came the proud wooers, and thereafter	αὐτὴν δʼ ἐς θρόνον εἷσεν ἄγων, ὑπὸ λῖτα πετάσσας, καλὸν δαιδάλεον· ὑπὸ δὲ θρῆνυς ποσὶν ἦεν. πὰρ δʼ αὐτὸς κλισμὸν θέτο ποικίλον, ἔκτοθεν ἄλλων μνηστήρων, μὴ ξεῖνος ἀνιηθεὶς ὀρυμαγδῷ δείπνῳ ἁδήσειεν, ὑπερφιάλοισι μετελθών,
 sat them down in rows on chairs and high seats. Heralds poured water over their hands, and maid-servants heaped by them bread in baskets, and youths filled the bowls brim full of drink; and they put forth their hands to the good cheer lying ready before them.	ἠδʼ ἵνα μιν περὶ πατρὸς ἀποιχομένοιο ἔροιτο. χέρνιβα δʼ ἀμφίπολος προχόῳ ἐπέχευε φέρουσα καλῇ χρυσείῃ, ὑπὲρ ἀργυρέοιο λέβητος, νίψασθαι· παρὰ δὲ ξεστὴν ἐτάνυσσε τράπεζαν. σῖτον δʼ αἰδοίη ταμίη παρέθηκε φέρουσα,
 Now after the wooers had put from them the desire of food and drink, their hearts turned to other things, to song and to dance; for these things are the crown of a feast. And a herald put the beautiful lyre in the hands of Phemius, who sang perforce among the wooers;	εἴδατα πόλλʼ ἐπιθεῖσα, χαριζομένη παρεόντων· δαιτρὸς δὲ κρειῶν πίνακας παρέθηκεν ἀείρας παντοίων, παρὰ δέ σφι τίθει χρύσεια κύπελλα· κῆρυξ δʼ αὐτοῖσιν θάμʼ ἐπῴχετο οἰνοχοεύων. ἐς δʼ ἦλθον μνηστῆρες ἀγήνορες. οἱ μὲν ἔπειτα
and he struck the chords in prelude to his sweet lay. But Telemachus spoke to flashing-eyed Athena, holding his head close, that the others might not hear: “Dear stranger, wilt thou be wroth with me for the word that I shall say? These men care for things like these, the lyre and song,	ἑξείης ἕζοντο κατὰ κλισμούς τε θρόνους τε, τοῖσι δὲ κήρυκες μὲν ὕδωρ ἐπὶ χεῖρας ἔχευαν, σῖτον δὲ δμῳαὶ παρενήνεον ἐν κανέοισιν, κοῦροι δὲ κρητῆρας ἐπεστέψαντο ποτοῖο. οἱ δʼ ἐπʼ ὀνείαθʼ ἑτοῖμα προκείμενα χεῖρας ἴαλλον.
full easily, seeing that without atonement they devour the livelihood of another, of a man whose white bones, it may be, rot in the rain as they lie upon the mainland, or the wave rolls them in the sea. Were they to see him returned to Ithaca , they would all pray to be swifter of foot,	αὐτὰρ ἐπεὶ πόσιος καὶ ἐδητύος ἐξ ἔρον ἕντο μνηστῆρες, τοῖσιν μὲν ἐνὶ φρεσὶν ἄλλα μεμήλει, μολπή τʼ ὀρχηστύς τε· τὰ γάρ τʼ ἀναθήματα δαιτός· κῆρυξ δʼ ἐν χερσὶν κίθαριν περικαλλέα θῆκεν Φημίῳ, ὅς ῥʼ ἤειδε παρὰ μνηστῆρσιν ἀνάγκῃ.
 rather than richer in gold and in raiment. But now he has thus perished by an evil doom, nor for us is there any comfort, no, not though any one of men upon the earth should say that he will come; gone is the day of his returning. But come, tell me this, and declare it truly.	ἦ τοι ὁ φορμίζων ἀνεβάλλετο καλὸν ἀείδειν. αὐτὰρ Τηλέμαχος προσέφη γλαυκῶπιν Ἀθήνην, ἄγχι σχὼν κεφαλήν, ἵνα μὴ πευθοίαθʼ οἱ ἄλλοι· ξεῖνε φίλʼ, ἦ καί μοι νεμεσήσεαι ὅττι κεν εἴπω; τούτοισιν μὲν ταῦτα μέλει, κίθαρις καὶ ἀοιδή,
Who art thou among men, and from whence? Where is thy city and where thy parents? On what manner of ship didst thou come, and how did sailors bring thee to Ithaca ? Who did they declare themselves to be? For nowise, methinks, didst thou come hither on foot. And tell me this also truly, that I may know full well,	ῥεῖʼ, ἐπεὶ ἀλλότριον βίοτον νήποινον ἔδουσιν, ἀνέρος, οὗ δή που λεύκʼ ὀστέα πύθεται ὄμβρῳ κείμενʼ ἐπʼ ἠπείρου, ἢ εἰν ἁλὶ κῦμα κυλίνδει. εἰ κεῖνόν γʼ Ἰθάκηνδε ἰδοίατο νοστήσαντα, πάντες κʼ ἀρησαίατʼ ἐλαφρότεροι πόδας εἶναι
whether this is thy first coming hither, or whether thou art indeed a friend of my father's house. For many were the men who came to our house as strangers, since he, too, had gone to and fro among men.” Then the goddess, flashing-eyed Athena, answered him: “Therefore of a truth will I frankly tell thee all.	ἢ ἀφνειότεροι χρυσοῖό τε ἐσθῆτός τε. νῦν δʼ ὁ μὲν ὣς ἀπόλωλε κακὸν μόρον, οὐδέ τις ἡμῖν θαλπωρή, εἴ πέρ τις ἐπιχθονίων ἀνθρώπων φῇσιν ἐλεύσεσθαι· τοῦ δʼ ὤλετο νόστιμον ἦμαρ. ἀλλʼ ἄγε μοι τόδε εἰπὲ καὶ ἀτρεκέως κατάλεξον·
 I declare that I am Mentes, the son of wise Anchialus, and I am lord over the oar-loving Taphians. And now have I put in here, as thou seest, with ship and crew, while sailing over the wine-dark sea to men of strange speech, on my way to Temese for copper; and I bear with me shining iron.	τίς πόθεν εἰς ἀνδρῶν; πόθι τοι πόλις ἠδὲ τοκῆες; ὁπποίης τʼ ἐπὶ νηὸς ἀφίκεο· πῶς δέ σε ναῦται ἤγαγον εἰς Ἰθάκην; τίνες ἔμμεναι εὐχετόωντο; οὐ μὲν γάρ τί σε πεζὸν ὀίομαι ἐνθάδʼ ἱκέσθαι. καί μοι τοῦτʼ ἀγόρευσον ἐτήτυμον, ὄφρʼ ἐὺ εἰδῶ,
 My ship lies yonder beside the fields away from the city, in the harbor of Rheithron, under woody Neion. Friends of one another do we declare ourselves to be, even as our fathers were, friends from of old. Nay, if thou wilt, go and ask the old warrior Laertes, who, they say,	ἠὲ νέον μεθέπεις ἦ καὶ πατρώιός ἐσσι ξεῖνος, ἐπεὶ πολλοὶ ἴσαν ἀνέρες ἡμέτερον δῶ ἄλλοι, ἐπεὶ καὶ κεῖνος ἐπίστροφος ἦν ἀνθρώπων. τὸν δʼ αὖτε προσέειπε θεά, γλαυκῶπις Ἀθήνη· τοιγὰρ ἐγώ τοι ταῦτα μάλʼ ἀτρεκέως ἀγορεύσω.
 comes no more to the city, but afar in the fields suffers woes attended by an aged woman as his handmaid, who sets before him food and drink, after weariness has laid hold of his limbs, as he creeps along the slope of his vineyard plot. And now am I come, for of a truth men said that he,	Μέντης Ἀγχιάλοιο δαΐφρονος εὔχομαι εἶναι υἱός, ἀτὰρ Ταφίοισι φιληρέτμοισιν ἀνάσσω. νῦν δʼ ὧδε ξὺν νηὶ κατήλυθον ἠδʼ ἑτάροισιν πλέων ἐπὶ οἴνοπα πόντον ἐπʼ ἀλλοθρόους ἀνθρώπους, ἐς Τεμέσην μετὰ χαλκόν, ἄγω δʼ αἴθωνα σίδηρον.
 thy father, was among his people; but lo, the gods are thwarting him of his return. For not yet has goodly Odysseus perished on the earth, but still, I ween, he lives and is held back on the broad sea in a sea-girt isle, and cruel men keep him, a savage folk, that constrain him, haply sore against his will.	νηῦς δέ μοι ἥδʼ ἕστηκεν ἐπʼ ἀγροῦ νόσφι πόληος, ἐν λιμένι Ῥείθρῳ ὑπὸ Νηίῳ ὑλήεντι. ξεῖνοι δʼ ἀλλήλων πατρώιοι εὐχόμεθʼ εἶναι ἐξ ἀρχῆς, εἴ πέρ τε γέροντʼ εἴρηαι ἐπελθὼν Λαέρτην ἥρωα, τὸν οὐκέτι φασὶ πόλινδε
 Nay, I will now prophesy to thee, as the immortals put it in my heart, and as I think it shall be brought to pass, though I am in no wise a soothsayer, nor one versed in the signs of birds. Not much longer shall he be absent from his dear native land, no, not though bonds of iron hold him.	ἔρχεσθʼ, ἀλλʼ ἀπάνευθεν ἐπʼ ἀγροῦ πήματα πάσχειν γρηὶ σὺν ἀμφιπόλῳ, ἥ οἱ βρῶσίν τε πόσιν τε παρτιθεῖ, εὖτʼ ἄν μιν κάματος κατὰ γυῖα λάβῃσιν ἑρπύζοντʼ ἀνὰ γουνὸν ἀλωῆς οἰνοπέδοιο. νῦν δʼ ἦλθον· δὴ γάρ μιν ἔφαντʼ ἐπιδήμιον εἶναι,
 He will contrive a way to return, for he is a man of many devices. But come, tell me this and declare it truly, whether indeed, tall as thou art, thou art the son of Odysseus himself. Wondrously like his are thy head and beautiful eyes; for full often did we consort with one another	σὸν πατέρʼ· ἀλλά νυ τόν γε θεοὶ βλάπτουσι κελεύθου. οὐ γάρ πω τέθνηκεν ἐπὶ χθονὶ δῖος Ὀδυσσεύς, ἀλλʼ ἔτι που ζωὸς κατερύκεται εὐρέι πόντῳ νήσῳ ἐν ἀμφιρύτῃ, χαλεποὶ δέ μιν ἄνδρες ἔχουσιν ἄγριοι, οἵ που κεῖνον ἐρυκανόωσʼ ἀέκοντα.
before he embarked for the land of Troy , whither others, too, the bravest of the Argives, went in their hollow ships. But since that day neither have I seen Odysseus, nor he me.” Then wise Telemachus answered her: “Therefore of a truth, stranger, will I frankly tell thee all.	αὐτὰρ νῦν τοι ἐγὼ μαντεύσομαι, ὡς ἐνὶ θυμῷ ἀθάνατοι βάλλουσι καὶ ὡς τελέεσθαι ὀίω, οὔτε τι μάντις ἐὼν οὔτʼ οἰωνῶν σάφα εἰδώς. οὔ τοι ἔτι δηρόν γε φίλης ἀπὸ πατρίδος αἴης ἔσσεται, οὐδʼ εἴ πέρ τε σιδήρεα δέσματʼ ἔχῃσιν·
 My mother says that I am his child; but I know not, for never yet did any man of himself know his own parentage. Ah, would that I had been the son of some blest man, whom old age overtook among his own possessions. But now of him who was the most ill-fated of mortal men	φράσσεται ὥς κε νέηται, ἐπεὶ πολυμήχανός ἐστιν. ἀλλʼ ἄγε μοι τόδε εἰπὲ καὶ ἀτρεκέως κατάλεξον, εἰ δὴ ἐξ αὐτοῖο τόσος πάϊς εἰς Ὀδυσῆος. αἰνῶς μὲν κεφαλήν τε καὶ ὄμματα καλὰ ἔοικας κείνῳ, ἐπεὶ θαμὰ τοῖον ἐμισγόμεθʼ ἀλλήλοισιν,
they say that I am sprung, since thou askest me of this.” Then the goddess, flashing-eyed Athena, answered him: “Surely, then, no nameless lineage have the gods appointed for thee in time to come, seeing that Penelope bore thee such as thou art. But come, tell me this and declare it truly.	πρίν γε τὸν ἐς Τροίην ἀναβήμεναι, ἔνθα περ ἄλλοι Ἀργείων οἱ ἄριστοι ἔβαν κοίλῃς ἐνὶ νηυσίν· ἐκ τοῦ δʼ οὔτʼ Ὀδυσῆα ἐγὼν ἴδον οὔτʼ ἔμʼ ἐκεῖνος. τὴν δʼ αὖ Τηλέμαχος πεπνυμένος ἀντίον ηὔδα· τοιγὰρ ἐγώ τοι, ξεῖνε, μάλʼ ἀτρεκέως ἀγορεύσω.
What feast, what throng is this? What need hast thou of it? Is it a drinking bout, or a wedding feast? For this plainly is no meal to which each brings his portion, with such outrage and overweening do they seem to me to be feasting in thy halls. Angered would a man be at seeing all these shameful acts, any man of sense who should come among them.”	μήτηρ μέν τέ μέ φησι τοῦ ἔμμεναι, αὐτὰρ ἐγώ γε οὐκ οἶδʼ· οὐ γάρ πώ τις ἑὸν γόνον αὐτὸς ἀνέγνω. ὡς δὴ ἐγώ γʼ ὄφελον μάκαρός νύ τευ ἔμμεναι υἱὸς ἀνέρος, ὃν κτεάτεσσιν ἑοῖς ἔπι γῆρας ἔτετμε. νῦν δʼ ὃς ἀποτμότατος γένετο θνητῶν ἀνθρώπων,
 Then wise Telemachus answered her: “Stranger, since indeed thou dost ask and question me of this, our house once bade fair to be rich and honorable, so long as that man was still among his people. But now the gods have willed otherwise in their evil devising,	τοῦ μʼ ἔκ φασι γενέσθαι, ἐπεὶ σύ με τοῦτʼ ἐρεείνεις. τὸν δʼ αὖτε προσέειπε θεά, γλαυκῶπις Ἀθήνη· οὐ μέν τοι γενεήν γε θεοὶ νώνυμνον ὀπίσσω θῆκαν, ἐπεὶ σέ γε τοῖον ἐγείνατο Πηνελόπεια. ἀλλʼ ἄγε μοι τόδε εἰπὲ καὶ ἀτρεκέως κατάλεξον·
 seeing that they have caused him to pass from sight as they have no other man. For I should not so grieve for his death, if he had been slain among his comrades in the land of the Trojans, or had died in the arms of his friends, when he had wound up the skein of war. Then would the whole host of the Achaeans have made him a tomb,	τίς δαίς, τίς δὲ ὅμιλος ὅδʼ ἔπλετο; τίπτε δέ σε χρεώ; εἰλαπίνη ἠὲ γάμος; ἐπεὶ οὐκ ἔρανος τάδε γʼ ἐστίν· ὥς τέ μοι ὑβρίζοντες ὑπερφιάλως δοκέουσι δαίνυσθαι κατὰ δῶμα. νεμεσσήσαιτό κεν ἀνὴρ αἴσχεα πόλλʼ ὁρόων, ὅς τις πινυτός γε μετέλθοι.
and for his son, too, he would have won great glory in days to come. But as it is, the spirits of the storm have swept him away and left no tidings: he is gone out of sight, out of hearing, and for me he has left anguish and weeping; nor do I in any wise mourn and wail for him alone, seeing that the gods have brought upon me other sore troubles.	τὴν δʼ αὖ Τηλέμαχος πεπνυμένος ἀντίον ηὔδα· ξεῖνʼ, ἐπεὶ ἂρ δὴ ταῦτά μʼ ἀνείρεαι ἠδὲ μεταλλᾷς, μέλλεν μέν ποτε οἶκος ὅδʼ ἀφνειὸς καὶ ἀμύμων ἔμμεναι, ὄφρʼ ἔτι κεῖνος ἀνὴρ ἐπιδήμιος ἦεν· νῦν δʼ ἑτέρως ἐβόλοντο θεοὶ κακὰ μητιόωντες,
For all the princes who hold sway over the islands—Dulichium and Same and wooded Zacynthus—and those who lord it over rocky Ithaca , all these woo my mother and lay waste my house. And she neither refuses the hateful marriage,	οἳ κεῖνον μὲν ἄιστον ἐποίησαν περὶ πάντων ἀνθρώπων, ἐπεὶ οὔ κε θανόντι περ ὧδʼ ἀκαχοίμην, εἰ μετὰ οἷς ἑτάροισι δάμη Τρώων ἐνὶ δήμῳ, ἠὲ φίλων ἐν χερσίν, ἐπεὶ πόλεμον τολύπευσεν. τῷ κέν οἱ τύμβον μὲν ἐποίησαν Παναχαιοί,
nor is she able to make an end; but they with feasting consume my substance: ere long they will bring me, too, to ruin.” Then, stirred to anger, Pallas Athena spoke to him:“Out on it! Thou hast of a truth sore need of Odysseus that is gone, that he might put forth his hands upon the shameless wooers.	ἠδέ κε καὶ ᾧ παιδὶ μέγα κλέος ἤρατʼ ὀπίσσω. νῦν δέ μιν ἀκλειῶς ἅρπυιαι ἀνηρείψαντο· οἴχετʼ ἄιστος ἄπυστος, ἐμοὶ δʼ ὀδύνας τε γόους τε κάλλιπεν. οὐδέ τι κεῖνον ὀδυρόμενος στεναχίζω οἶον, ἐπεί νύ μοι ἄλλα θεοὶ κακὰ κήδεʼ ἔτευξαν.
 Would that he might come now and take his stand at the outer gate of the house, with helmet and shield and two spears, such a man as he was when I first saw him in our house drinking and making merry, on his way back from Ephyre, from the house of Ilus, son of Mermerus.	ὅσσοι γὰρ νήσοισιν ἐπικρατέουσιν ἄριστοι, Δουλιχίῳ τε Σάμῃ τε καὶ ὑλήεντι Ζακύνθῳ, ἠδʼ ὅσσοι κραναὴν Ἰθάκην κάτα κοιρανέουσιν, τόσσοι μητέρʼ ἐμὴν μνῶνται, τρύχουσι δὲ οἶκον. ἡ δʼ οὔτʼ ἀρνεῖται στυγερὸν γάμον οὔτε τελευτὴν
 For thither, too, went Odysseus in his swift ship in search of a deadly drug, that he might have wherewith to smear his bronze-tipped arrows; yet Ilus gave it not to him, for he stood in awe of the gods that are forever; but my father gave it, for he held him strangely dear.	ποιῆσαι δύναται· τοὶ δὲ φθινύθουσιν ἔδοντες οἶκον ἐμόν· τάχα δή με διαρραίσουσι καὶ αὐτόν. τὸν δʼ ἐπαλαστήσασα προσηύδα Παλλὰς Ἀθήνη· ὢ πόποι, ἦ δὴ πολλὸν ἀποιχομένου Ὀδυσῆος δεύῃ, ὅ κε μνηστῆρσιν ἀναιδέσι χεῖρας ἐφείη.
 Would, I say, that in such strength Odysseus might come amongst the wooers; then should they all find swift destruction and bitterness in their wooing. Yet these things verily lie on the knees of the gods, whether he shall return and wreak vengeance in his halls, or whether he shall not; but for thyself, I bid thee take thought	εἰ γὰρ νῦν ἐλθὼν δόμου ἐν πρώτῃσι θύρῃσι σταίη, ἔχων πήληκα καὶ ἀσπίδα καὶ δύο δοῦρε, τοῖος ἐὼν οἷόν μιν ἐγὼ τὰ πρῶτʼ ἐνόησα οἴκῳ ἐν ἡμετέρῳ πίνοντά τε τερπόμενόν τε, ἐξ Ἐφύρης ἀνιόντα παρʼ Ἴλου Μερμερίδαο—
 how thou mayest thrust forth the wooers from the hall. Come now, give ear, and hearken to my words. On the morrow call to an assembly the Achaean lords, and speak out thy word to all, and let the gods be thy witnesses. As for the wooers, bid them scatter, each to his own;	ᾤχετο γὰρ καὶ κεῖσε θοῆς ἐπὶ νηὸς Ὀδυσσεὺς φάρμακον ἀνδροφόνον διζήμενος, ὄφρα οἱ εἴη ἰοὺς χρίεσθαι χαλκήρεας· ἀλλʼ ὁ μὲν οὔ οἱ δῶκεν, ἐπεί ῥα θεοὺς νεμεσίζετο αἰὲν ἐόντας, ἀλλὰ πατήρ οἱ δῶκεν ἐμός· φιλέεσκε γὰρ αἰνῶς—
and for thy mother, if her heart bids her marry, let her go back to the hall of her mighty father, and there they will prepare a wedding feast, and make ready the gifts full many—aye, all that should follow after a well-loved daughter. And to thyself will I give wise counsel, if thou wilt hearken.	τοῖος ἐὼν μνηστῆρσιν ὁμιλήσειεν Ὀδυσσεύς· πάντες κʼ ὠκύμοροί τε γενοίατο πικρόγαμοί τε. ἀλλʼ ἦ τοι μὲν ταῦτα θεῶν ἐν γούνασι κεῖται, ἤ κεν νοστήσας ἀποτίσεται, ἦε καὶ οὐκί, οἷσιν ἐνὶ μεγάροισι· σὲ δὲ φράζεσθαι ἄνωγα,
Man with twenty rowers the best ship thou hast, and go to seek tidings of thy father, that has long been gone, if haply any mortal may tell thee, or thou mayest hear a voice from Zeus, which oftenest brings tidings to men. First go to Pylos and question goodly Nestor,	ὅππως κε μνηστῆρας ἀπώσεαι ἐκ μεγάροιο. εἰ δʼ ἄγε νῦν ξυνίει καὶ ἐμῶν ἐμπάζεο μύθων· αὔριον εἰς ἀγορὴν καλέσας ἥρωας Ἀχαιοὺς μῦθον πέφραδε πᾶσι, θεοὶ δʼ ἐπὶ μάρτυροι ἔστων. μνηστῆρας μὲν ἐπὶ σφέτερα σκίδνασθαι ἄνωχθι,
and from thence to Sparta to fair-haired Menelaus; for he was the last to reach home of the brazen-coated Achaeans. If so be thou shalt hear that thy father is alive and coming home, then verily, though thou art sore afflicted, thou couldst endure for yet a year. But if thou shalt hear that he is dead and gone,	μητέρα δʼ, εἴ οἱ θυμὸς ἐφορμᾶται γαμέεσθαι, ἂψ ἴτω ἐς μέγαρον πατρὸς μέγα δυναμένοιο· οἱ δὲ γάμον τεύξουσι καὶ ἀρτυνέουσιν ἔεδνα πολλὰ μάλʼ, ὅσσα ἔοικε φίλης ἐπὶ παιδὸς ἕπεσθαι. σοὶ δʼ αὐτῷ πυκινῶς ὑποθήσομαι, αἴ κε πίθηαι·
 how thou mayest slay the wooers in thy halls whether by guile or openly; for it beseems thee not to practise childish ways, since thou art no longer of such an age. Or hast thou not heard what fame the goodly Orestes won among all mankind when he slew his father's murderer,	νῆʼ ἄρσας ἐρέτῃσιν ἐείκοσιν, ἥ τις ἀρίστη, ἔρχεο πευσόμενος πατρὸς δὴν οἰχομένοιο, ἤν τίς τοι εἴπῃσι βροτῶν, ἢ ὄσσαν ἀκούσῃς ἐκ Διός, ἥ τε μάλιστα φέρει κλέος ἀνθρώποισι. πρῶτα μὲν ἐς Πύλον ἐλθὲ καὶ εἴρεο Νέστορα δῖον,
 the guileful Aegisthus, for that he slew his glorious father? Thou too, my friend, for I see that thou art comely and tall, be thou valiant, that many an one of men yet to be born may praise thee. But now I will go down to my swift ship and my comrades, who, methinks, are chafing much at waiting for me.	κεῖθεν δὲ Σπάρτηνδε παρὰ ξανθὸν Μενέλαον· ὃς γὰρ δεύτατος ἦλθεν Ἀχαιῶν χαλκοχιτώνων. εἰ μέν κεν πατρὸς βίοτον καὶ νόστον ἀκούσῃς, ἦ τʼ ἂν τρυχόμενός περ ἔτι τλαίης ἐνιαυτόν· εἰ δέ κε τεθνηῶτος ἀκούσῃς μηδʼ ἔτʼ ἐόντος,
For thyself, give heed and have regard to my words.” Then wise Telemachus answered her: “Stranger, in truth thou speakest these things with kindly thought, as a father to his son, and never will I forget them. But come now, tarry, eager though thou art to be gone,	νοστήσας δὴ ἔπειτα φίλην ἐς πατρίδα γαῖαν σῆμά τέ οἱ χεῦαι καὶ ἐπὶ κτέρεα κτερεΐξαι πολλὰ μάλʼ, ὅσσα ἔοικε, καὶ ἀνέρι μητέρα δοῦναι. αὐτὰρ ἐπὴν δὴ ταῦτα τελευτήσῃς τε καὶ ἔρξῃς, φράζεσθαι δὴ ἔπειτα κατὰ φρένα καὶ κατὰ θυμὸν
in order that when thou hast bathed and satisfied thy heart to the full, thou mayest go to thy ship glad in spirit, and bearing a gift costly and very beautiful, which shall be to thee an heirloom from me, even such a gift as dear friends give to friends.” Then the goddess, flashing-eyed Athena, answered him:	ὅππως κε μνηστῆρας ἐνὶ μεγάροισι τεοῖσι κτείνῃς ἠὲ δόλῳ ἢ ἀμφαδόν· οὐδέ τί σε χρὴ νηπιάας ὀχέειν, ἐπεὶ οὐκέτι τηλίκος ἐσσι. ἢ οὐκ ἀίεις οἷον κλέος ἔλλαβε δῖος Ὀρέστης πάντας ἐπʼ ἀνθρώπους, ἐπεὶ ἔκτανε πατροφονῆα,
“Stay me now no longer, when I am eager to be gone, and whatsoever gift thy heart bids thee give me, give it when I come back, to bear to my home, choosing a right beautiful one; it shall bring thee its worth in return.” So spoke the goddess, flashing-eyed Athena, and departed,	Αἴγισθον δολόμητιν, ὅ οἱ πατέρα κλυτὸν ἔκτα; καὶ σύ, φίλος, μάλα γάρ σʼ ὁρόω καλόν τε μέγαν τε, ἄλκιμος ἔσσʼ, ἵνα τίς σε καὶ ὀψιγόνων ἐὺ εἴπῃ. αὐτὰρ ἐγὼν ἐπὶ νῆα θοὴν κατελεύσομαι ἤδη ἠδʼ ἑτάρους, οἵ πού με μάλʼ ἀσχαλόωσι μένοντες·
flying upward as a bird; and in his heart she put strength and courage, and made him think of his father even more than aforetime. And in his mind he marked her and marvelled, for he deemed that she was a god; and straightway he went among the wooers, a godlike man.	σοὶ δʼ αὐτῷ μελέτω, καὶ ἐμῶν ἐμπάζεο μύθων. τὴν δʼ αὖ Τηλέμαχος πεπνυμένος ἀντίον ηὔδα· ξεῖνʼ, ἦ τοι μὲν ταῦτα φίλα φρονέων ἀγορεύεις, ὥς τε πατὴρ ᾧ παιδί, καὶ οὔ ποτε λήσομαι αὐτῶν. ἀλλʼ ἄγε νῦν ἐπίμεινον, ἐπειγόμενός περ ὁδοῖο,
For them the famous minstrel was singing, and they sat in silence listening; and he sang of the return of the Achaeans—the woeful return from Troy which Pallas Athena laid upon them. And from her upper chamber the daughter of Icarius, wise Penelope, heard his wondrous song,	ὄφρα λοεσσάμενός τε τεταρπόμενός τε φίλον κῆρ, δῶρον ἔχων ἐπὶ νῆα κίῃς, χαίρων ἐνὶ θυμῷ, τιμῆεν, μάλα καλόν, ὅ τοι κειμήλιον ἔσται ἐξ ἐμεῦ, οἷα φίλοι ξεῖνοι ξείνοισι διδοῦσι. τὸν δʼ ἠμείβετʼ ἔπειτα θεά, γλαυκῶπις Ἀθήνη·
 and she went down the high stairway from her chamber, not alone, for two handmaids attended her. Now when the fair lady had come to the wooers, she stood by the door-post of the well-built hall, holding before her face her shining veil;	μή μʼ ἔτι νῦν κατέρυκε, λιλαιόμενόν περ ὁδοῖο. δῶρον δʼ ὅττι κέ μοι δοῦναι φίλον ἦτορ ἀνώγῃ, αὖτις ἀνερχομένῳ δόμεναι οἶκόνδε φέρεσθαι, καὶ μάλα καλὸν ἑλών· σοὶ δʼ ἄξιον ἔσται ἀμοιβῆς. ἡ μὲν ἄρʼ ὣς εἰποῦσʼ ἀπέβη γλαυκῶπις Ἀθήνη,
and a faithful handmaid stood on either side of her. Then she burst into tears, and spoke to the divine minstrel: “Phemius, many other things thou knowest to charm mortals, deeds of men and gods which minstrels make famous. Sing them one of these, as thou sittest here,	ὄρνις δʼ ὣς ἀνόπαια διέπτατο· τῷ δʼ ἐνὶ θυμῷ θῆκε μένος καὶ θάρσος, ὑπέμνησέν τέ ἑ πατρὸς μᾶλλον ἔτʼ ἢ τὸ πάροιθεν. ὁ δὲ φρεσὶν ᾗσι νοήσας θάμβησεν κατὰ θυμόν· ὀίσατο γὰρ θεὸν εἶναι. αὐτίκα δὲ μνηστῆρας ἐπῴχετο ἰσόθεος φώς.
Then wise Telemachus answered her: “My mother, why dost thou begrudge the good minstrel to give pleasure in whatever way his heart is moved? It is not minstrels that are to blame, but Zeus, I ween, is to blame, who gives to men that live by toil, to each one as he will.	τοῖσι δʼ ἀοιδὸς ἄειδε περικλυτός, οἱ δὲ σιωπῇ ἥατʼ ἀκούοντες· ὁ δʼ Ἀχαιῶν νόστον ἄειδε λυγρόν, ὃν ἐκ Τροίης ἐπετείλατο Παλλὰς Ἀθήνη. τοῦ δʼ ὑπερωιόθεν φρεσὶ σύνθετο θέσπιν ἀοιδὴν κούρη Ἰκαρίοιο, περίφρων Πηνελόπεια·
 With this man no one can be wroth if he sings of the evil doom of the Danaans; for men praise that song the most which comes the newest to their ears. For thyself, let thy heart and soul endure to listen; for not Odysseus alone lost	κλίμακα δʼ ὑψηλὴν κατεβήσετο οἷο δόμοιο, οὐκ οἴη, ἅμα τῇ γε καὶ ἀμφίπολοι δύʼ ἕποντο. ἡ δʼ ὅτε δὴ μνηστῆρας ἀφίκετο δῖα γυναικῶν, στῆ ῥα παρὰ σταθμὸν τέγεος πύκα ποιητοῖο, ἄντα παρειάων σχομένη λιπαρὰ κρήδεμνα·
in Troy the day of his return, but many others likewise perished. Nay, go to thy chamber, and busy thyself with thine own tasks, the loom and the distaff, and bid thy handmaids ply their tasks; but speech shall be for men, for all, but most of all for me; since mine is the authority in the house.”	ἀμφίπολος δʼ ἄρα οἱ κεδνὴ ἑκάτερθε παρέστη. δακρύσασα δʼ ἔπειτα προσηύδα θεῖον ἀοιδόν· Φήμιε, πολλὰ γὰρ ἄλλα βροτῶν θελκτήρια οἶδας, ἔργʼ ἀνδρῶν τε θεῶν τε, τά τε κλείουσιν ἀοιδοί· τῶν ἕν γέ σφιν ἄειδε παρήμενος, οἱ δὲ σιωπῇ
She then, seized with wonder, went back to her chamber, for she laid to heart the wise saying of her son. Up to her upper chamber she went with her handmaids, and then bewailed Odysseus, her dear husband until flashing-eyed Athena cast sweet sleep upon her eyelids.	οἶνον πινόντων· ταύτης δʼ ἀποπαύεʼ ἀοιδῆς λυγρῆς, ἥ τέ μοι αἰεὶ ἐνὶ στήθεσσι φίλον κῆρ τείρει, ἐπεί με μάλιστα καθίκετο πένθος ἄλαστον. τοίην γὰρ κεφαλὴν ποθέω μεμνημένη αἰεί, ἀνδρός, τοῦ κλέος εὐρὺ καθʼ Ἑλλάδα καὶ μέσον Ἄργος.
But the wooers broke into uproar throughout the shadowy halls, and all prayed, each that he might lie by her side. And among them wise Telemachus was the first to speak: “Wooers of my mother, overweening in your insolence, for the present let us make merry with feasting,	τὴν δʼ αὖ Τηλέμαχος πεπνυμένος ἀντίον ηὔδα· μῆτερ ἐμή, τί τʼ ἄρα φθονέεις ἐρίηρον ἀοιδὸν τέρπειν ὅππῃ οἱ νόος ὄρνυται; οὔ νύ τʼ ἀοιδοὶ αἴτιοι, ἀλλά ποθι Ζεὺς αἴτιος, ὅς τε δίδωσιν ἀνδράσιν ἀλφηστῇσιν, ὅπως ἐθέλῃσιν, ἑκάστῳ.
 but let there be no brawling; for this is a goodly thing, to listen to a minstrel such as this man is, like to the gods in voice. But in the morning let us go to the assembly and take our seats, one and all, that I may declare my word to you outright that you depart from these halls. Prepare you other feasts,	τούτῳ δʼ οὐ νέμεσις Δαναῶν κακὸν οἶτον ἀείδειν· τὴν γὰρ ἀοιδὴν μᾶλλον ἐπικλείουσʼ ἄνθρωποι, ἥ τις ἀκουόντεσσι νεωτάτη ἀμφιπέληται. σοὶ δʼ ἐπιτολμάτω κραδίη καὶ θυμὸς ἀκούειν· οὐ γὰρ Ὀδυσσεὺς οἶος ἀπώλεσε νόστιμον ἦμαρ
 eating your own substance and changing from house to house. But if this seems in your eyes to be a better and more profitable thing, that one man's livelihood should be ruined without atonement, waste ye it. But I will call upon the gods that are forever, if haply Zeus may grant that deeds of requital may be wrought.	ἐν Τροίῃ, πολλοὶ δὲ καὶ ἄλλοι φῶτες ὄλοντο. ἀλλʼ εἰς οἶκον ἰοῦσα τὰ σʼ αὐτῆς ἔργα κόμιζε, ἱστόν τʼ ἠλακάτην τε, καὶ ἀμφιπόλοισι κέλευε ἔργον ἐποίχεσθαι· μῦθος δʼ ἄνδρεσσι μελήσει πᾶσι, μάλιστα δʼ ἐμοί· τοῦ γὰρ κράτος ἔστʼ ἐνὶ οἴκῳ.
Without atonement, then, should ye perish within my halls.” So he spoke, and they all bit their lips and marvelled at Telemachus, for that he spoke boldly. Then Antinous, son of Eupeithes, answered him:“Telemachus, verily the gods themselves are teaching thee	ἡ μὲν θαμβήσασα πάλιν οἶκόνδε βεβήκει· παιδὸς γὰρ μῦθον πεπνυμένον ἔνθετο θυμῷ. ἐς δʼ ὑπερῷʼ ἀναβᾶσα σὺν ἀμφιπόλοισι γυναιξὶ κλαῖεν ἔπειτʼ Ὀδυσῆα φίλον πόσιν, ὄφρα οἱ ὕπνον ἡδὺν ἐπὶ βλεφάροισι βάλε γλαυκῶπις Ἀθήνη.
to be a man of vaunting tongue, and to speak with boldness. May the son of Cronos never make thee king in sea-girt Ithaca , which thing is by birth thy heritage.” Then wise Telemachus answered him: “Antinous, wilt thou be wroth with me for the word that I shall say?	μνηστῆρες δʼ ὁμάδησαν ἀνὰ μέγαρα σκιόεντα, πάντες δʼ ἠρήσαντο παραὶ λεχέεσσι κλιθῆναι. τοῖσι δὲ Τηλέμαχος πεπνυμένος ἤρχετο μύθων· μητρὸς ἐμῆς μνηστῆρες ὑπέρβιον ὕβριν ἔχοντες, νῦν μὲν δαινύμενοι τερπώμεθα, μηδὲ βοητὺς
 Even this should I be glad to accept from the hand of Zeus. Thinkest thou indeed that this is the worst fate among men? Nay, it is no bad thing to be a king. Straightway one's house grows rich and oneself is held in greater honor. However, there are other kings of the Achaeans	ἔστω, ἐπεὶ τόδε καλὸν ἀκουέμεν ἐστὶν ἀοιδοῦ τοιοῦδʼ οἷος ὅδʼ ἐστί, θεοῖς ἐναλίγκιος αὐδήν. ἠῶθεν δʼ ἀγορήνδε καθεζώμεσθα κιόντες πάντες, ἵνʼ ὕμιν μῦθον ἀπηλεγέως ἀποείπω, ἐξιέναι μεγάρων· ἄλλας δʼ ἀλεγύνετε δαῖτας,
full many in seagirt Ithaca , both young and old. One of these haply may have this place, since goodly Odysseus is dead. But I will be lord of our own house and of the slaves that goodly Odysseus won for me.” Then Eurymachus, son of Polybus, answered him:	ὑμὰ κτήματʼ ἔδοντες, ἀμειβόμενοι κατὰ οἴκους. εἰ δʼ ὕμιν δοκέει τόδε λωίτερον καὶ ἄμεινον ἔμμεναι, ἀνδρὸς ἑνὸς βίοτον νήποινον ὀλέσθαι, κείρετʼ· ἐγὼ δὲ θεοὺς ἐπιβώσομαι αἰὲν ἐόντας, αἴ κέ ποθι Ζεὺς δῷσι παλίντιτα ἔργα γενέσθαι·
“Telemachus, this matter verily lies on the knees of the gods, who of the Achaeans shall be king in sea-girt Ithaca ; but as for thy possessions, thou mayest keep them thyself, and be lord in thine own house. Never may that man come who by violence and against thy will shall wrest thy possessions from thee, while men yet live in Ithaca .	νήποινοί κεν ἔπειτα δόμων ἔντοσθεν ὄλοισθε. ὣς ἔφαθʼ, οἱ δʼ ἄρα πάντες ὀδὰξ ἐν χείλεσι φύντες Τηλέμαχον θαύμαζον, ὃ θαρσαλέως ἀγόρευεν. τὸν δʼ αὖτʼ Ἀντίνοος προσέφη, Εὐπείθεος υἱός· Τηλέμαχʼ, ἦ μάλα δή σε διδάσκουσιν θεοὶ αὐτοὶ
 But I am fain, good sir, to ask thee of the stranger, whence this man comes. Of what land does he declare himself to be? Where are his kinsmen and his native fields? Does he bring some tidings of thy father's coming, or came he hither in furtherance of some matter of his own?	ὑψαγόρην τʼ ἔμεναι καὶ θαρσαλέως ἀγορεύειν· μὴ σέ γʼ ἐν ἀμφιάλῳ Ἰθάκῃ βασιλῆα Κρονίων ποιήσειεν, ὅ τοι γενεῇ πατρώιόν ἐστιν. τὸν δʼ αὖ Τηλέμαχος πεπνυμένος ἀντίον ηὔδα· Ἀντίνοʼ, ἦ καί μοι νεμεσήσεαι ὅττι κεν εἴπω;
How he started up, and was straightway gone! Nor did he wait to be known; and yet he seemed no base man to look upon.” Then wise Telemachus answered him: “Eurymachus, surely my father's home-coming is lost and gone. No longer do I put trust in tidings, whencesoever they may come,	καί κεν τοῦτʼ ἐθέλοιμι Διός γε διδόντος ἀρέσθαι. ἦ φῂς τοῦτο κάκιστον ἐν ἀνθρώποισι τετύχθαι; οὐ μὲν γάρ τι κακὸν βασιλευέμεν· αἶψά τέ οἱ δῶ ἀφνειὸν πέλεται καὶ τιμηέστερος αὐτός. ἀλλʼ ἦ τοι βασιλῆες Ἀχαιῶν εἰσὶ καὶ ἄλλοι
nor reck I of any prophecy which my mother haply may learn of a seer, when she has called him to the hall. But this stranger is a friend of my father's house from Taphos. He declares that he is Mentes, son of wise Anchialus, and he is lord over the oar-loving Taphians.”	πολλοὶ ἐν ἀμφιάλῳ Ἰθάκῃ, νέοι ἠδὲ παλαιοί, τῶν κέν τις τόδʼ ἔχῃσιν, ἐπεὶ θάνε δῖος Ὀδυσσεύς· αὐτὰρ ἐγὼν οἴκοιο ἄναξ ἔσομʼ ἡμετέροιο καὶ δμώων, οὕς μοι ληίσσατο δῖος Ὀδυσσεύς. τὸν δʼ αὖτʼ Εὐρύμαχος Πολύβου πάϊς ἀντίον ηὔδα·
So spoke Telemachus, but in his heart he knew the immortal goddess. Now the wooers turned to the dance and to gladsome song, and made them merry, and waited till evening should come; and as they made merry dark evening came upon them. Then they went, each man to his house, to take their rest.	Τηλέμαχʼ, ἦ τοι ταῦτα θεῶν ἐν γούνασι κεῖται, ὅς τις ἐν ἀμφιάλῳ Ἰθάκῃ βασιλεύσει Ἀχαιῶν· κτήματα δʼ αὐτὸς ἔχοις καὶ δώμασιν οἷσιν ἀνάσσοις. μὴ γὰρ ὅ γʼ ἔλθοι ἀνὴρ ὅς τίς σʼ ἀέκοντα βίηφιν κτήματʼ ἀπορραίσει, Ἰθάκης ἔτι ναιετοώσης.
 But Telemachus, where his chamber was built in the beautiful court, high, in a place of wide outlook, thither went to his bed, pondering many things in mind; and with him, bearing blazing torches, went true-hearted Eurycleia, daughter of Ops, son of Peisenor.	ἀλλʼ ἐθέλω σε, φέριστε, περὶ ξείνοιο ἐρέσθαι, ὁππόθεν οὗτος ἀνήρ, ποίης δʼ ἐξ εὔχεται εἶναι γαίης, ποῦ δέ νύ οἱ γενεὴ καὶ πατρὶς ἄρουρα. ἠέ τινʼ ἀγγελίην πατρὸς φέρει ἐρχομένοιο, ἦ ἑὸν αὐτοῦ χρεῖος ἐελδόμενος τόδʼ ἱκάνει;
Her long ago Laertes had bought with his wealth, when she was in her first youth, and gave for her the price of twenty oxen; and he honored her even as he honored his faithful wife in his halls, but he never lay with her in love, for he shunned the wrath of his wife. She it was who bore for Telemachus the blazing torches;	οἷον ἀναΐξας ἄφαρ οἴχεται, οὐδʼ ὑπέμεινε γνώμεναι· οὐ μὲν γάρ τι κακῷ εἰς ὦπα ἐῴκει. τὸν δʼ αὖ Τηλέμαχος πεπνυμένος ἀντίον ηὔδα· Εὐρύμαχʼ, ἦ τοι νόστος ἀπώλετο πατρὸς ἐμοῖο· οὔτʼ οὖν ἀγγελίῃ ἔτι πείθομαι, εἴ ποθεν ἔλθοι,
 for she of all the handmaids loved him most, and had nursed him when he was a child. He opened the doors of the well-built chamber, sat down on the bed, and took off his soft tunic and laid it in the wise old woman's hands. And she folded and smoothed the tunic	οὔτε θεοπροπίης ἐμπάζομαι, ἥν τινα μήτηρ ἐς μέγαρον καλέσασα θεοπρόπον ἐξερέηται. ξεῖνος δʼ οὗτος ἐμὸς πατρώιος ἐκ Τάφου ἐστίν, Μέντης δʼ Ἀγχιάλοιο δαΐφρονος εὔχεται εἶναι υἱός, ἀτὰρ Ταφίοισι φιληρέτμοισιν ἀνάσσει.
and hung it on a peg beside the corded bedstead, and then went forth from the chamber, drawing the door to by its silver handle, and driving the bolt home with the thong. So there, the night through, wrapped in a fleece of wool, he pondered in his mind upon the journey which Athena had shewn him.	ὣς φάτο Τηλέμαχος, φρεσὶ δʼ ἀθανάτην θεὸν ἔγνω. οἱ δʼ εἰς ὀρχηστύν τε καὶ ἱμερόεσσαν ἀοιδὴν τρεψάμενοι τέρποντο, μένον δʼ ἐπὶ ἕσπερον ἐλθεῖν. τοῖσι δὲ τερπομένοισι μέλας ἐπὶ ἕσπερος ἦλθε· δὴ τότε κακκείοντες ἔβαν οἶκόνδε ἕκαστος.
 Soon as early Dawn appeared, the rosy-fingered, up from his bed arose the dear son of Odysseus and put on his clothing. About his shoulder he slung his sharp sword, and beneath his shining feet bound his fair sandals,	τήν ποτε Λαέρτης πρίατο κτεάτεσσιν ἑοῖσιν πρωθήβην ἔτʼ ἐοῦσαν, ἐεικοσάβοια δʼ ἔδωκεν, ἶσα δέ μιν κεδνῇ ἀλόχῳ τίεν ἐν μεγάροισιν, εὐνῇ δʼ οὔ ποτʼ ἔμικτο, χόλον δʼ ἀλέεινε γυναικός· ἥ οἱ ἅμʼ αἰθομένας δαΐδας φέρε, καί ἑ μάλιστα
 and went forth from his chamber like a god to look upon. Straightway he bade the clear-voiced heralds to summon to the assembly the long-haired Achaeans. And the heralds made the summons, and the Achaeans assembled full quickly. Now when they were assembled and met together,	δμῳάων φιλέεσκε, καὶ ἔτρεφε τυτθὸν ἐόντα. ὤιξεν δὲ θύρας θαλάμου πύκα ποιητοῖο, ἕζετο δʼ ἐν λέκτρῳ, μαλακὸν δʼ ἔκδυνε χιτῶνα· καὶ τὸν μὲν γραίης πυκιμηδέος ἔμβαλε χερσίν. ἡ μὲν τὸν πτύξασα καὶ ἀσκήσασα χιτῶνα,
Telemachus went his way to the place of assembly, holding in his hand a spear of bronze—not alone, for along with him two swift hounds followed; and wondrous was the grace that Athena shed upon him, and all the people marvelled at him as he came. But he sat down in his father's seat, and the elders gave place.	πασσάλῳ ἀγκρεμάσασα παρὰ τρητοῖσι λέχεσσι βῆ ῥʼ ἴμεν ἐκ θαλάμοιο, θύρην δʼ ἐπέρυσσε κορώνῃ ἀργυρέῃ, ἐπὶ δὲ κληῖδʼ ἐτάνυσσεν ἱμάντι. ἔνθʼ ὅ γε παννύχιος, κεκαλυμμένος οἰὸς ἀώτῳ, βούλευε φρεσὶν ᾗσιν ὁδὸν τὴν πέφραδʼ Ἀθήνη.
in his hollow cave, and made of him his latest meal. Three others there were; one, Eurynomus, consorted with the wooers, and two ever kept their father's farm. Yet, even so, he could not forget that other, mourning and sorrowing; and weeping for him he addressed the assembly, and spoke among them:	ἦμος δʼ ἠριγένεια φάνη ῥοδοδάκτυλος Ἠώς, ὤρνυτʼ ἄρʼ ἐξ εὐνῆφιν Ὀδυσσῆος φίλος υἱὸς εἵματα ἑσσάμενος, περὶ δὲ ξίφος ὀξὺ θέτʼ ὤμῳ, ποσσὶ δʼ ὑπὸ λιπαροῖσιν ἐδήσατο καλὰ πέδιλα,
“Hearken now to me, men of Ithaca , to the word that I shall say. Never have we held assembly or session since the day when goodly Odysseus departed in the hollow ships. And now who has called us together? On whom has such need come either of the young men or of those who are older?	βῆ δʼ ἴμεν ἐκ θαλάμοιο θεῷ ἐναλίγκιος ἄντην. αἶψα δὲ κηρύκεσσι λιγυφθόγγοισι κέλευσε κηρύσσειν ἀγορήνδε κάρη κομόωντας Ἀχαιούς. οἱ μὲν ἐκήρυσσον, τοὶ δʼ ἠγείροντο μάλʼ ὦκα. αὐτὰρ ἐπεί ῥʼ ἤγερθεν ὁμηγερέες τʼ ἐγένοντο,
Has he heard some tidings of the army's return, which he might tell us plainly, seeing that he has first learned of it himself? Or is there some other public matter on which he is to speak and address us? A good man he seems in my eyes, a blessed man. May Zeus fulfil unto him himself some good, even whatsoever he desires in his heart.”	βῆ ῥʼ ἴμεν εἰς ἀγορήν, παλάμῃ δʼ ἔχε χάλκεον ἔγχος, οὐκ οἶος, ἅμα τῷ γε δύω κύνες ἀργοὶ ἕποντο. θεσπεσίην δʼ ἄρα τῷ γε χάριν κατέχευεν Ἀθήνη. τὸν δʼ ἄρα πάντες λαοὶ ἐπερχόμενον θηεῦντο· ἕζετο δʼ ἐν πατρὸς θώκῳ, εἶξαν δὲ γέροντες.
So he spoke, and the dear son of Odysseus rejoiced at the word of omen; nor did he thereafter remain seated, but was fain to speak. So he took his stand in the midst of the assembly, and the staff was placed in his hands by the herald Peisenor, wise in counsel. Then he spoke, addressing first the old man:	τοῖσι δʼ ἔπειθʼ ἥρως Αἰγύπτιος ἦρχʼ ἀγορεύειν, ὃς δὴ γήραϊ κυφὸς ἔην καὶ μυρία ᾔδη. καὶ γὰρ τοῦ φίλος υἱὸς ἅμʼ ἀντιθέῳ Ὀδυσῆι Ἴλιον εἰς ἐύπωλον ἔβη κοίλῃς ἐνὶ νηυσίν, Ἄντιφος αἰχμητής· τὸν δʼ ἄγριος ἔκτανε Κύκλωψ
 “Old man, not far off, as thou shalt soon learn thyself, is that man who has called the host together—even I; for on me above all others has sorrow come. I have neither heard any tidings of the army's return, which I might tell you plainly, seeing that I had first learned of it myself, nor is there any other public matter on which I am to speak and address you.	ἐν σπῆι γλαφυρῷ, πύματον δʼ ὡπλίσσατο δόρπον. τρεῖς δέ οἱ ἄλλοι ἔσαν, καὶ ὁ μὲν μνηστῆρσιν ὁμίλει, Εὐρύνομος, δύο δʼ αἰὲν ἔχον πατρώια ἔργα. ἀλλʼ οὐδʼ ὣς τοῦ λήθετʼ ὀδυρόμενος καὶ ἀχεύων. τοῦ ὅ γε δάκρυ χέων ἀγορήσατο καὶ μετέειπε·
 Nay, it is mine own need, for that evil has fallen upon my house in two-fold wise. First, I have lost my noble sire who was once king among you here, and was gentle as a father; and now there is come an evil yet greater far, which will presently altogether destroy my house and ruin all my livelihood.	κέκλυτε δὴ νῦν μευ, Ἰθακήσιοι, ὅττι κεν εἴπω· οὔτε ποθʼ ἡμετέρη ἀγορὴ γένετʼ οὔτε θόωκος ἐξ οὗ Ὀδυσσεὺς δῖος ἔβη κοίλῃς ἐνὶ νηυσί. νῦν δὲ τίς ὧδʼ ἤγειρε; τίνα χρειὼ τόσον ἵκει ἠὲ νέων ἀνδρῶν ἢ οἳ προγενέστεροί εἰσιν;
 My mother have wooers beset against her will, the sons of those men who are here the noblest. They shrink from going to the house of her father, Icarius, that he may himself exact the bride-gifts for his daughter, and give her to whom he will, even to him who meets his favour,	ἠέ τινʼ ἀγγελίην στρατοῦ ἔκλυεν ἐρχομένοιο, ἥν χʼ ἡμῖν σάφα εἴποι, ὅτε πρότερός γε πύθοιτο; ἦέ τι δήμιον ἄλλο πιφαύσκεται ἠδʼ ἀγορεύει; ἐσθλός μοι δοκεῖ εἶναι, ὀνήμενος. εἴθε οἱ αὐτῷ Ζεὺς ἀγαθὸν τελέσειεν, ὅτι φρεσὶν ᾗσι μενοινᾷ.
 but thronging our house day after day they slay our oxen and sheep and fat goats, and keep revel, and drink the sparkling wine recklessly; and havoc is made of all this wealth. For there is no man here, such as Odysseus was, to ward off ruin from the house.	ὣς φάτο, χαῖρε δὲ φήμῃ Ὀδυσσῆος φίλος υἱός, οὐδʼ ἄρʼ ἔτι δὴν ἧστο, μενοίνησεν δʼ ἀγορεύειν, στῆ δὲ μέσῃ ἀγορῇ· σκῆπτρον δέ οἱ ἔμβαλε χειρὶ κῆρυξ Πεισήνωρ πεπνυμένα μήδεα εἰδώς. πρῶτον ἔπειτα γέροντα καθαπτόμενος προσέειπεν·
 As for me, I am no-wise such as he to ward it off. Nay verily, even if I try I shall be found a weakling and one knowing naught of valor. Yet truly I would defend myself, if I had but the power; for now deeds past all enduring have been wrought, and past all that is seemly has my house been destroyed. Take shame upon yourselves,	ὦ γέρον, οὐχ ἑκὰς οὗτος ἀνήρ, τάχα δʼ εἴσεαι αὐτός, ὃς λαὸν ἤγειρα· μάλιστα δέ μʼ ἄλγος ἱκάνει. οὔτε τινʼ ἀγγελίην στρατοῦ ἔκλυον ἐρχομένοιο, ἥν χʼ ὑμῖν σάφα εἴπω, ὅτε πρότερός γε πυθοίμην, οὔτε τι δήμιον ἄλλο πιφαύσκομαι οὐδʼ ἀγορεύω,
and have regard to your neighbors who dwell roundabout, and fear the wrath of the gods, lest haply they turn against you in anger at your evil deeds. I pray you by Olympian Zeus, and by Themis who looses and gathers the assemblies of men,	ἀλλʼ ἐμὸν αὐτοῦ χρεῖος, ὅ μοι κακὰ ἔμπεσεν οἴκῳ δοιά· τὸ μὲν πατέρʼ ἐσθλὸν ἀπώλεσα, ὅς ποτʼ ἐν ὑμῖν τοίσδεσσιν βασίλευε, πατὴρ δʼ ὣς ἤπιος ἦεν· νῦν δʼ αὖ καὶ πολὺ μεῖζον, ὃ δὴ τάχα οἶκον ἅπαντα πάγχυ διαρραίσει, βίοτον δʼ ἀπὸ πάμπαν ὀλέσσει.
forbear, my friends, and leave me alone to pine in bitter grief—unless indeed my father, goodly Odysseus, despitefully wrought the well-greaved Achaeans woe, in requital whereof ye work me woe despitefully by urging these men on. For me it were better	μητέρι μοι μνηστῆρες ἐπέχραον οὐκ ἐθελούσῃ, τῶν ἀνδρῶν φίλοι υἷες, οἳ ἐνθάδε γʼ εἰσὶν ἄριστοι, οἳ πατρὸς μὲν ἐς οἶκον ἀπερρίγασι νέεσθαι Ἰκαρίου, ὥς κʼ αὐτὸς ἐεδνώσαιτο θύγατρα, δοίη δʼ ᾧ κʼ ἐθέλοι καί οἱ κεχαρισμένος ἔλθοι·
that ye should yourselves eat up my treasures and my flocks. If ye were to devour them, recompense would haply be made some day; for just so long should we go up and down the city, pressing our suit and asking back our goods, until all was given back. But now past cure are the woes ye put upon my heart.”	οἱ δʼ εἰς ἡμέτερον πωλεύμενοι ἤματα πάντα, βοῦς ἱερεύοντες καὶ ὄις καὶ πίονας αἶγας εἰλαπινάζουσιν πίνουσί τε αἴθοπα οἶνον μαψιδίως· τὰ δὲ πολλὰ κατάνεται. οὐ γὰρ ἔπʼ ἀνήρ, οἷος Ὀδυσσεὺς ἔσκεν, ἀρὴν ἀπὸ οἴκου ἀμῦναι.
Thus he spoke in wrath, and dashed the staff down upon the ground, bursting into tears; and pity fell upon all the people. Then all the others kept silent, and no man had the heart to answer Telemachus with angry words. Antinous alone answered him, and said:	ἡμεῖς δʼ οὔ νύ τι τοῖοι ἀμυνέμεν· ἦ καὶ ἔπειτα λευγαλέοι τʼ ἐσόμεσθα καὶ οὐ δεδαηκότες ἀλκήν. ἦ τʼ ἂν ἀμυναίμην, εἴ μοι δύναμίς γε παρείη. οὐ γὰρ ἔτʼ ἀνσχετὰ ἔργα τετεύχαται, οὐδʼ ἔτι καλῶς οἶκος ἐμὸς διόλωλε. νεμεσσήθητε καὶ αὐτοί,
“Telemachus, thou braggart, unrestrained in daring, what a thing hast thou said, putting us to shame, and wouldest fain fasten reproach upon us! Nay, I tell thee, it is not the Achaean wooers who are anywise at fault, but thine own mother, for she is crafty above all women. For it is now the third year and the fourth will soon pass,	ἄλλους τʼ αἰδέσθητε περικτίονας ἀνθρώπους, οἳ περιναιετάουσι· θεῶν δʼ ὑποδείσατε μῆνιν, μή τι μεταστρέψωσιν ἀγασσάμενοι κακὰ ἔργα. λίσσομαι ἠμὲν Ζηνὸς Ὀλυμπίου ἠδὲ Θέμιστος, ἥ τʼ ἀνδρῶν ἀγορὰς ἠμὲν λύει ἠδὲ καθίζει·
 since she has been deceiving the hearts of the Achaeans in their breasts. To all she offers hopes, and has promises for each man, sending them messages, but her mind is set on other things. And she devised in her heart this guileful thing also: she set up in her halls a great web, and fell to weaving—	σχέσθε, φίλοι, καί μʼ οἶον ἐάσατε πένθεϊ λυγρῷ τείρεσθʼ, εἰ μή πού τι πατὴρ ἐμὸς ἐσθλὸς Ὀδυσσεὺς δυσμενέων κάκʼ ἔρεξεν ἐυκνήμιδας Ἀχαιούς, τῶν μʼ ἀποτινύμενοι κακὰ ῥέζετε δυσμενέοντες, τούτους ὀτρύνοντες. ἐμοὶ δέ κε κέρδιον εἴη
fine of thread was the web and very wide; and straightway she spoke among us: “‘Young men, my wooers, since goodly Odysseus is dead, be patient, though eager for my marriage, until I finish this robe—I would not that my spinning should come to naught—a shroud for the lord Laertes, against the time when	ὑμέας ἐσθέμεναι κειμήλιά τε πρόβασίν τε. εἴ χʼ ὑμεῖς γε φάγοιτε, τάχʼ ἄν ποτε καὶ τίσις εἴη· τόφρα γὰρ ἂν κατὰ ἄστυ ποτιπτυσσοίμεθα μύθῳ χρήματʼ ἀπαιτίζοντες, ἕως κʼ ἀπὸ πάντα δοθείη· νῦν δέ μοι ἀπρήκτους ὀδύνας ἐμβάλλετε θυμῷ.
the fell fate of grievous death shall strike him down; lest any of the Achaean women in the land should be wroth with me, if he, who had won great possessions, were to lie without a shroud.’ “So she spoke, and our proud hearts consented. Then day by day she would weave at the great web,	ὣς φάτο χωόμενος, ποτὶ δὲ σκῆπτρον βάλε γαίῃ δάκρυʼ ἀναπρήσας· οἶκτος δʼ ἕλε λαὸν ἅπαντα. ἔνθʼ ἄλλοι μὲν πάντες ἀκὴν ἔσαν, οὐδέ τις ἔτλη Τηλέμαχον μύθοισιν ἀμείψασθαι χαλεποῖσιν· Ἀντίνοος δέ μιν οἶος ἀμειβόμενος προσέειπε·
 but by night would unravel it, when she had let place torches by her. Thus for three years she by her craft kept the Achaeans from knowing, and beguiled them; but when the fourth year came as the seasons rolled on, even then one of her women who knew all told us, and we caught her unravelling the splendid web.	Τηλέμαχʼ ὑψαγόρη, μένος ἄσχετε, ποῖον ἔειπες ἡμέας αἰσχύνων· ἐθέλοις δέ κε μῶμον ἀνάψαι. σοὶ δʼ οὔ τι μνηστῆρες Ἀχαιῶν αἴτιοί εἰσιν, ἀλλὰ φίλη μήτηρ, ἥ τοι πέρι κέρδεα οἶδεν. ἤδη γὰρ τρίτον ἐστὶν ἔτος, τάχα δʼ εἶσι τέταρτον,
 So she finished it against her will, perforce. Therefore to thee the wooers make answer thus, that thou mayest thyself know it in thine heart, and that all the Achaeans may know. Send away thy mother, and command her to wed whomsoever her father bids, and whoso is pleasing to her.	ἐξ οὗ ἀτέμβει θυμὸν ἐνὶ στήθεσσιν Ἀχαιῶν. πάντας μέν ῥʼ ἔλπει καὶ ὑπίσχεται ἀνδρὶ ἑκάστῳ ἀγγελίας προϊεῖσα, νόος δέ οἱ ἄλλα μενοινᾷ. ἡ δὲ δόλον τόνδʼ ἄλλον ἐνὶ φρεσὶ μερμήριξε· στησαμένη μέγαν ἱστὸν ἐνὶ μεγάροισιν ὕφαινε,
 But if she shall continue long time to vex the sons of the Achaeans, mindful in her heart of this, that Athena has endowed her above other women with knowledge of fair handiwork and an understanding heart, and wiles, such as we have never yet heard that any even of the women of old knew, of those who long ago were fair-tressed Achaean women—	λεπτὸν καὶ περίμετρον· ἄφαρ δʼ ἡμῖν μετέειπε· κοῦροι ἐμοὶ μνηστῆρες, ἐπεὶ θάνε δῖος Ὀδυσσεύς, μίμνετʼ ἐπειγόμενοι τὸν ἐμὸν γάμον, εἰς ὅ κε φᾶρος ἐκτελέσω, μή μοι μεταμώνια νήματʼ ὄληται, Λαέρτῃ ἥρωι ταφήιον, εἰς ὅτε κέν μιν
 Tyro and Alcmene and Mycene of the fair crown—of whom not one was like Penelope in shrewd device; yet this at least she devised not aright. For so long shall men devour thy livelihood and thy possessions, even as long as she shall keep the counsel which	μοῖρʼ ὀλοὴ καθέλῃσι τανηλεγέος θανάτοιο, μή τίς μοι κατὰ δῆμον Ἀχαιϊάδων νεμεσήσῃ. αἴ κεν ἄτερ σπείρου κεῖται πολλὰ κτεατίσσας. ὣς ἔφαθʼ, ἡμῖν δʼ αὖτʼ ἐπεπείθετο θυμὸς ἀγήνωρ. ἔνθα καὶ ἠματίη μὲν ὑφαίνεσκεν μέγαν ἱστόν,
the gods now put in her heart. Great fame she brings on herself, but on thee regret for thy much substance. For us, we will go neither to our lands nor else whither, until she marries that one of the Achaeans whom she will.” Then wise Telemachus answered him, and said:	νύκτας δʼ ἀλλύεσκεν, ἐπεὶ δαΐδας παραθεῖτο. ὣς τρίετες μὲν ἔληθε δόλῳ καὶ ἔπειθεν Ἀχαιούς· ἀλλʼ ὅτε τέτρατον ἦλθεν ἔτος καὶ ἐπήλυθον ὧραι, καὶ τότε δή τις ἔειπε γυναικῶν, ἣ σάφα ᾔδη, καὶ τήν γʼ ἀλλύουσαν ἐφεύρομεν ἀγλαὸν ἱστόν.
 “Antinous, in no wise may I thrust forth from the house against her will her that bore me and reared me; and, as for my father, he is in some other land, whether he be alive or dead. An evil thing it were for me to pay back a great price to Icarius, as I must, if of my own will I send my mother away. For from her father's hand shall I suffer evil, and heaven	ὣς τὸ μὲν ἐξετέλεσσε καὶ οὐκ ἐθέλουσʼ ὑπʼ ἀνάγκης· σοὶ δʼ ὧδε μνηστῆρες ὑποκρίνονται, ἵνʼ εἰδῇς αὐτὸς σῷ θυμῷ, εἰδῶσι δὲ πάντες Ἀχαιοί· μητέρα σὴν ἀπόπεμψον, ἄνωχθι δέ μιν γαμέεσθαι τῷ ὅτεῴ τε πατὴρ κέλεται καὶ ἁνδάνει αὐτῇ.
 will send other ills besides, for my mother as she leaves the house will invoke the dread Avengers; and I shall have blame, too, from men. Therefore will I never speak this word. And for you, if your own heart is wroth here at, get you forth from my halls and prepare you other feasts,	εἰ δʼ ἔτʼ ἀνιήσει γε πολὺν χρόνον υἷας Ἀχαιῶν, τὰ φρονέουσʼ ἀνὰ θυμόν, ὅ οἱ πέρι δῶκεν Ἀθήνη ἔργα τʼ ἐπίστασθαι περικαλλέα καὶ φρένας ἐσθλὰς κέρδεά θʼ, οἷʼ οὔ πώ τινʼ ἀκούομεν οὐδὲ παλαιῶν, τάων αἳ πάρος ἦσαν ἐυπλοκαμῖδες Ἀχαιαί,
 eating your own substance and changing from house to house. But if this seems in your eyes to be a better and more profitable thing, that one man's livelihood should be ruined without atonement, waste ye it. But I will call upon the gods that are forever, if haply Zeus may grant that deeds of requital may be wrought.	Τυρώ τʼ Ἀλκμήνη τε ἐυστέφανός τε Μυκήνη· τάων οὔ τις ὁμοῖα νοήματα Πηνελοπείῃ ᾔδη· ἀτὰρ μὲν τοῦτό γʼ ἐναίσιμον οὐκ ἐνόησε. τόφρα γὰρ οὖν βίοτόν τε τεὸν καὶ κτήματʼ ἔδονται, ὄφρα κε κείνη τοῦτον ἔχῃ νόον, ὅν τινά οἱ νῦν
Without atonement then should ye perish within my halls.” So spoke Telemachus, and in answer Zeus, whose voice is borne afar, sent forth two eagles, flying from on high, from a mountain peak. For a time they flew swift as the blasts of the wind side by side with wings outspread;	ἐν στήθεσσι τιθεῖσι θεοί. μέγα μὲν κλέος αὐτῇ ποιεῖτʼ, αὐτὰρ σοί γε ποθὴν πολέος βιότοιο. ἡμεῖς δʼ οὔτʼ ἐπὶ ἔργα πάρος γʼ ἴμεν οὔτε πῃ ἄλλῃ, πρίν γʼ αὐτὴν γήμασθαι Ἀχαιῶν ᾧ κʼ ἐθέλῃσι. τὸν δʼ αὖ Τηλέμαχος πεπνυμένος ἀντίον ηὔδα·
 but when they reached the middle of the many-voiced assembly, then they wheeled about, flapping their wings rapidly, and down on the heads of all they looked, and death was in their glare. Then they tore with their talons one another's cheeks and necks on either side, and darted away to the right across the houses and the city of the men.	Ἀντίνοʼ, οὔ πως ἔστι δόμων ἀέκουσαν ἀπῶσαι ἥ μʼ ἔτεχʼ, ἥ μʼ ἔθρεψε· πατὴρ δʼ ἐμὸς ἄλλοθι γαίης, ζώει ὅ γʼ ἦ τέθνηκε· κακὸν δέ με πόλλʼ ἀποτίνειν Ἰκαρίῳ, αἴ κʼ αὐτὸς ἑκὼν ἀπὸ μητέρα πέμψω. ἐκ γὰρ τοῦ πατρὸς κακὰ πείσομαι, ἄλλα δὲ δαίμων
 But they were seized with wonder at the birds when their eyes beheld them, and pondered in their hearts on what was to come to pass. Then among them spoke the old lord Halitherses, son of Mastor, for he surpassed all men of his day in knowledge of birds and in uttering words of fate.	δώσει, ἐπεὶ μήτηρ στυγερὰς ἀρήσετʼ ἐρινῦς οἴκου ἀπερχομένη· νέμεσις δέ μοι ἐξ ἀνθρώπων ἔσσεται· ὣς οὐ τοῦτον ἐγώ ποτε μῦθον ἐνίψω. ὑμέτερος δʼ εἰ μὲν θυμὸς νεμεσίζεται αὐτῶν, ἔξιτέ μοι μεγάρων, ἄλλας δʼ ἀλεγύνετε δαῖτας
He with good intent addressed their assembly, and spoke among them: “Hearken now to me, men of Ithaca , to the word that I shall say; and to the wooers especially do I declare and announce these things, since on them a great woe is rolling. For Odysseus shall not long be away from his friends, but even now, methinks,	ὑμὰ κτήματʼ ἔδοντες ἀμειβόμενοι κατὰ οἴκους. εἰ δʼ ὑμῖν δοκέει τόδε λωίτερον καὶ ἄμεινον ἔμμεναι, ἀνδρὸς ἑνὸς βίοτον νήποινον ὀλέσθαι, κείρετʼ· ἐγὼ δὲ θεοὺς ἐπιβώσομαι αἰὲν ἐόντας, αἴ κέ ποθι Ζεὺς δῷσι παλίντιτα ἔργα γενέσθαι.
he is near, and is sowing death and fate for these men, one and all. Aye, and to many others of us also who dwell in clear-seen Ithaca will he be a bane. But long ere that let us take thought how we may make an end of this—or rather let them of themselves make an end, for this is straightway the better course for them.	νήποινοί κεν ἔπειτα δόμων ἔντοσθεν ὄλοισθε. ὣς φάτο Τηλέμαχος, τῷ δʼ αἰετὼ εὐρύοπα Ζεὺς ὑψόθεν ἐκ κορυφῆς ὄρεος προέηκε πέτεσθαι. τὼ δʼ ἕως μέν ῥʼ ἐπέτοντο μετὰ πνοιῇς ἀνέμοιο πλησίω ἀλλήλοισι τιταινομένω πτερύγεσσιν·
Not as one untried do I prophesy, but with sure knowledge. For unto Odysseus I declare that all things are fulfilled even as I told him, when the Argives embarked for Ilios and with them went Odysseus of many wiles. I declared that after suffering many ills and losing all his comrades he would come home in the twentieth year	ἀλλʼ ὅτε δὴ μέσσην ἀγορὴν πολύφημον ἱκέσθην, ἔνθʼ ἐπιδινηθέντε τιναξάσθην πτερὰ πυκνά, ἐς δʼ ἰδέτην πάντων κεφαλάς, ὄσσοντο δʼ ὄλεθρον· δρυψαμένω δʼ ὀνύχεσσι παρειὰς ἀμφί τε δειρὰς δεξιὼ ἤιξαν διά τʼ οἰκία καὶ πόλιν αὐτῶν.
unknown to all; and lo, all this is now being brought to pass.” Then Eurymachus, son of Polybus, answered him, and said: “Old man, up now, get thee home and prophesy to thy children, lest haply in days to come they suffer ill.	θάμβησαν δʼ ὄρνιθας, ἐπεὶ ἴδον ὀφθαλμοῖσιν· ὥρμηναν δʼ ἀνὰ θυμὸν ἅ περ τελέεσθαι ἔμελλον. τοῖσι δὲ καὶ μετέειπε γέρων ἥρως Ἁλιθέρσης Μαστορίδης· ὁ γὰρ οἶος ὁμηλικίην ἐκέκαστο ὄρνιθας γνῶναι καὶ ἐναίσιμα μυθήσασθαι·
 In this matter I am better far than thou to prophesy. Many birds there are that fare to and fro under the rays of the sun, and not all are fateful. As for Odysseus, he has perished far away, as I would that thou hadst likewise perished with him. Then wouldst thou not prate so much in thy reading of signs,	ὅ σφιν ἐὺ φρονέων ἀγορήσατο καὶ μετέειπε· κέκλυτε δὴ νῦν μευ, Ἰθακήσιοι, ὅττι κεν εἴπω· μνηστῆρσιν δὲ μάλιστα πιφαυσκόμενος τάδε εἴρω· τοῖσιν γὰρ μέγα πῆμα κυλίνδεται· οὐ γὰρ Ὀδυσσεὺς δὴν ἀπάνευθε φίλων ὧν ἔσσεται, ἀλλά που ἤδη
 or be urging Telemachus on in his wrath, hoping for some gift for thy house, if haply he shall give it. But I will speak out to thee, and this word shall verily be brought to pass. If thou, wise in the wisdom of old, shalt beguile with thy talk a younger man, and set him on to be wroth,	ἐγγὺς ἐὼν τοῖσδεσσι φόνον καὶ κῆρα φυτεύει πάντεσσιν· πολέσιν δὲ καὶ ἄλλοισιν κακὸν ἔσται, οἳ νεμόμεσθʼ Ἰθάκην ἐυδείελον. ἀλλὰ πολὺ πρὶν φραζώμεσθʼ, ὥς κεν καταπαύσομεν· οἱ δὲ καὶ αὐτοὶ παυέσθων· καὶ γάρ σφιν ἄφαρ τόδε λώιόν ἐστιν.
 for him in the first place it shall be the more grievous, and he will in no case be able to do aught because of these men here, and on thee, old man, will we lay a fine which it will grieve thy soul to pay, and bitter shall be thy sorrow. And to Telemachus I myself, here among all, will offer this counsel.	οὐ γὰρ ἀπείρητος μαντεύομαι, ἀλλʼ ἐὺ εἰδώς· καὶ γὰρ κείνῳ φημὶ τελευτηθῆναι ἅπαντα, ὥς οἱ ἐμυθεόμην, ὅτε Ἴλιον εἰσανέβαινον Ἀργεῖοι, μετὰ δέ σφιν ἔβη πολύμητις Ὀδυσσεύς. φῆν κακὰ πολλὰ παθόντʼ, ὀλέσαντʼ ἄπο πάντας ἑταίρους,
 His mother let him bid to go back to the house of her father, and they will prepare a wedding feast and make ready the gifts full many,—aye, all that should follow after a well-loved daughter. For ere that, methinks, the sons of the Achaeans will not cease from their grievous wooing, since in any case we fear no man,—	ἄγνωστον πάντεσσιν ἐεικοστῷ ἐνιαυτῷ οἴκαδʼ ἐλεύσεσθαι· τὰ δὲ δὴ νῦν πάντα τελεῖται. τὸν δʼ αὖτʼ Εὐρύμαχος Πολύβου πάϊς ἀντίον ηὔδα· ὦ γέρον, εἰ δʼ ἄγε νῦν μαντεύεο σοῖσι τέκεσσιν οἴκαδʼ ἰών, μή πού τι κακὸν πάσχωσιν ὀπίσσω·
 no, not Telemachus for all his many words,—nor do we reck of any soothsaying which thou, old man, mayest declare; it will fail of fulfillment, and thou shalt be hated the more. Aye, and his possessions shall be devoured in evil wise, nor shall requital ever be made, so long as she shall put off the Achaeans	ταῦτα δʼ ἐγὼ σέο πολλὸν ἀμείνων μαντεύεσθαι. ὄρνιθες δέ τε πολλοὶ ὑπʼ αὐγὰς ἠελίοιο φοιτῶσʼ, οὐδέ τε πάντες ἐναίσιμοι· αὐτὰρ Ὀδυσσεὺς ὤλετο τῆλʼ, ὡς καὶ σὺ καταφθίσθαι σὺν ἐκείνῳ ὤφελες. οὐκ ἂν τόσσα θεοπροπέων ἀγόρευες,
in the matter of her marriage. And we on our part waiting here day after day are rivals by reason of her excellence, and go not after other women, whom each one might fitly wed.” Then wise Telemachus answered him: “Eurymachus and all ye other lordly wooers,	οὐδέ κε Τηλέμαχον κεχολωμένον ὧδʼ ἀνιείης, σῷ οἴκῳ δῶρον ποτιδέγμενος, αἴ κε πόρῃσιν. ἀλλʼ ἔκ τοι ἐρέω, τὸ δὲ καὶ τετελεσμένον ἔσται· αἴ κε νεώτερον ἄνδρα παλαιά τε πολλά τε εἰδὼς παρφάμενος ἐπέεσσιν ἐποτρύνῃς χαλεπαίνειν,
in this matter I entreat you no longer nor speak thereof, for now the gods know it, and all the Achaeans. But come, give me a swift ship and twenty comrades who will accomplish my journey for me to and fro. For I shall go to Sparta and to sandy Pylos	αὐτῷ μέν οἱ πρῶτον ἀνιηρέστερον ἔσται, πρῆξαι δʼ ἔμπης οὔ τι δυνήσεται εἵνεκα τῶνδε· σοὶ δέ, γέρον, θωὴν ἐπιθήσομεν, ἥν κʼ ἐνὶ θυμῷ τίνων ἀσχάλλῃς· χαλεπὸν δέ τοι ἔσσεται ἄλγος. Τηλεμάχῳ δʼ ἐν πᾶσιν ἐγὼν ὑποθήσομαι αὐτός·
 to seek tidings of the return of my father that has long been gone, if haply any mortal man may tell me, or I may hear a voice from Zeus, which oftenest brings tidings to men.	μητέρα ἣν ἐς πατρὸς ἀνωγέτω ἀπονέεσθαι· οἱ δὲ γάμον τεύξουσι καὶ ἀρτυνέουσιν ἔεδνα πολλὰ μάλʼ, ὅσσα ἔοικε φίλης ἐπὶ παιδὸς ἕπεσθαι. οὐ γὰρ πρὶν παύσεσθαι ὀίομαι υἷας Ἀχαιῶν μνηστύος ἀργαλέης, ἐπεὶ οὔ τινα δείδιμεν ἔμπης,
If so be I shall hear that my father is alive and coming home, then verily, though I am sore afflicted, I could endure for yet a year. But if I shall hear that he is dead and gone, then I will return to my dear native land and heap up a mound for him, and over it pay funeral rites, full many, as is due, and give my mother to a husband.” So saying he sat down, and among them rose	οὔτʼ οὖν Τηλέμαχον μάλα περ πολύμυθον ἐόντα, οὔτε θεοπροπίης ἐμπαζόμεθʼ, ἣν σύ, γεραιέ, μυθέαι ἀκράαντον, ἀπεχθάνεαι δʼ ἔτι μᾶλλον. χρήματα δʼ αὖτε κακῶς βεβρώσεται, οὐδέ ποτʼ ἶσα ἔσσεται, ὄφρα κεν ἥ γε διατρίβῃσιν Ἀχαιοὺς
Mentor, who was a comrade of noble Odysseus. To him, on departing with his ships, Odysseus had given all his house in charge, that it should obey the old man and that he should keep all things safe. He with good intent addressed their assembly, and spoke among them: “Hearken now to me, men of Ithaca , to the word that I shall say.	ὃν γάμον· ἡμεῖς δʼ αὖ ποτιδέγμενοι ἤματα πάντα εἵνεκα τῆς ἀρετῆς ἐριδαίνομεν, οὐδὲ μετʼ ἄλλας ἐρχόμεθʼ, ἃς ἐπιεικὲς ὀπυιέμεν ἐστὶν ἑκάστῳ. τὸν δʼ αὖ Τηλέμαχος πεπνυμένος ἀντίον ηὔδα· Εὐρύμαχʼ ἠδὲ καὶ ἄλλοι, ὅσοι μνηστῆρες ἀγαυοί,
 Never henceforth let sceptred king with a ready heart be kind and gentle, nor let him heed righteousness in his heart, but let him ever be harsh and work unrighteousness, seeing that no one remembers divine Odysseus of the people whose lord he was; yet gentle was he as a father.	ταῦτα μὲν οὐχ ὑμέας ἔτι λίσσομαι οὐδʼ ἀγορεύω· ἤδη γὰρ τὰ ἴσασι θεοὶ καὶ πάντες Ἀχαιοί. ἀλλʼ ἄγε μοι δότε νῆα θοὴν καὶ εἴκοσʼ ἑταίρους, οἵ κέ μοι ἔνθα καὶ ἔνθα διαπρήσσωσι κέλευθον. εἶμι γὰρ ἐς Σπάρτην τε καὶ ἐς Πύλον ἠμαθόεντα
 But of a truth I begrudge not the proud wooers that they work deeds of violence in the evil contrivings of their minds, for it is at the hazard of their own lives that they violently devour the house of Odysseus, who, they say, will no more return. Nay, rather it is with the rest of the folk that I am wroth, that ye all	νόστον πευσόμενος πατρὸς δὴν οἰχομένοιο, ἤν τίς μοι εἴπῃσι βροτῶν ἢ ὄσσαν ἀκούσω ἐκ Διός, ἥ τε μάλιστα φέρει κλέος ἀνθρώποισιν· εἰ μέν κεν πατρὸς βίοτον καὶ νόστον ἀκούσω, ἦ τʼ ἄν, τρυχόμενός περ, ἔτι τλαίην ἐνιαυτόν·
sit thus in silence, and utter no word of rebuke to make the wooers cease, though ye are many and they but few.” Then Leocritus, son of Euenor, answered him:“Mentor, thou mischief-maker, thou wanderer in thy wits, what hast thou said, bidding men make us cease? Nay, it were a hard thing	εἰ δέ κε τεθνηῶτος ἀκούσω μηδʼ ἔτʼ ἐόντος, νοστήσας δὴ ἔπειτα φίλην ἐς πατρίδα γαῖαν σῆμά τέ οἱ χεύω καὶ ἐπὶ κτέρεα κτερεΐξω πολλὰ μάλʼ, ὅσσα ἔοικε, καὶ ἀνέρι μητέρα δώσω. ἦ τοι ὅ γʼ ὣς εἰπὼν κατʼ ἄρʼ ἕζετο, τοῖσι δʼ ἀνέστη
 to fight about a feast with men that moreover outnumber you. For if Ithacan Odysseus himself were to come and be eager at heart to drive out from his hall the lordly wooers who are feasting in his house, then should his wife have no joy	Μέντωρ, ὅς ῥʼ Ὀδυσῆος ἀμύμονος ἦεν ἑταῖρος, καί οἱ ἰὼν ἐν νηυσὶν ἐπέτρεπεν οἶκον ἅπαντα, πείθεσθαί τε γέροντι καὶ ἔμπεδα πάντα φυλάσσειν· ὅ σφιν ἐὺ φρονέων ἀγορήσατο καὶ μετέειπεν· κέκλυτε δὴ νῦν μευ, Ἰθακήσιοι, ὅττι κεν εἴπω·
at his coming, though sorely she longed for him, but right here would he meet a shameful death, if he fought with men that outnumbered him. Thou hast not spoken aright. But come now, ye people, scatter, each one of you to his own lands. As for this fellow, Mentor and Halitherses will speed his journey, for they are friends of his father's house from of old.	μή τις ἔτι πρόφρων ἀγανὸς καὶ ἤπιος ἔστω σκηπτοῦχος βασιλεύς, μηδὲ φρεσὶν αἴσιμα εἰδώς, ἀλλʼ αἰεὶ χαλεπός τʼ εἴη καὶ αἴσυλα ῥέζοι· ὡς οὔ τις μέμνηται Ὀδυσσῆος θείοιο λαῶν οἷσιν ἄνασσε, πατὴρ δʼ ὣς ἤπιος ἦεν.
But methinks he will long abide here and get his tidings in Ithaca , and never accomplish this journey.” So he spoke, and hastily broke up the assembly. They then scattered, each one to his own house; and the wooers went to the house of divine Odysseus.	ἀλλʼ ἦ τοι μνηστῆρας ἀγήνορας οὔ τι μεγαίρω ἔρδειν ἔργα βίαια κακορραφίῃσι νόοιο· σφὰς γὰρ παρθέμενοι κεφαλὰς κατέδουσι βιαίως οἶκον Ὀδυσσῆος, τὸν δʼ οὐκέτι φασὶ νέεσθαι. νῦν δʼ ἄλλῳ δήμῳ νεμεσίζομαι, οἷον ἅπαντες
 But Telemachus went apart to the shore of the sea, and having washed his hands in the grey seawater, prayed to Athena: “Hear me, thou who didst come yesterday as a god to our house, and didst bid me go in a ship over the misty deep to seek tidings of the return of my father, that has long been gone.	ἧσθʼ ἄνεῳ, ἀτὰρ οὔ τι καθαπτόμενοι ἐπέεσσι παύρους μνηστῆρας καταπαύετε πολλοὶ ἐόντες. τὸν δʼ Εὐηνορίδης Λειώκριτος ἀντίον ηὔδα· Μέντορ ἀταρτηρέ, φρένας ἠλεέ, ποῖον ἔειπες ἡμέας ὀτρύνων καταπαυέμεν. ἀργαλέον δὲ
Lo, all this the Achaeans hinder, but the wooers most of all in their evil insolence.” So he spoke in prayer, and Athena drew near to him in the likeness of Mentor, both in form and invoice; and she spoke, and addressed him with winged words:	ἀνδράσι καὶ πλεόνεσσι μαχήσασθαι περὶ δαιτί. εἴ περ γάρ κʼ Ὀδυσεὺς Ἰθακήσιος αὐτὸς ἐπελθὼν δαινυμένους κατὰ δῶμα ἑὸν μνηστῆρας ἀγαυοὺς ἐξελάσαι μεγάροιο μενοινήσειʼ ἐνὶ θυμῷ, οὔ κέν οἱ κεχάροιτο γυνή, μάλα περ χατέουσα,
 “Telemachus, neither hereafter shalt thou be a base man or a witless, if aught of thy father's goodly spirit has been instilled into thee, such a man was he to fulfil both deed and word. So then shall this journey of thine be neither vain nor unfulfilled. But if thou art not the son of him and of Penelope,	ἐλθόντʼ, ἀλλά κεν αὐτοῦ ἀεικέα πότμον ἐπίσποι, εἰ πλεόνεσσι μάχοιτο· σὺ δʼ οὐ κατὰ μοῖραν ἔειπες. ἀλλʼ ἄγε, λαοὶ μὲν σκίδνασθʼ ἐπὶ ἔργα ἕκαστος, τούτῳ δʼ ὀτρυνέει Μέντωρ ὁδὸν ἠδʼ Ἁλιθέρσης, οἵ τέ οἱ ἐξ ἀρχῆς πατρώιοί εἰσιν ἑταῖροι.
 then I have no hope that thou wilt accomplish thy desire. Few sons indeed are like their fathers; most are worse, few better than their fathers. But since neither hereafter shalt thou be a base man or a witless, nor has the wisdom of Odysseus wholly failed thee,	ἀλλʼ ὀίω, καὶ δηθὰ καθήμενος ἀγγελιάων πεύσεται εἰν Ἰθάκῃ, τελέει δʼ ὁδὸν οὔ ποτε ταύτην. ὣς ἄρʼ ἐφώνησεν, λῦσεν δʼ ἀγορὴν αἰψηρήν. οἱ μὲν ἄρʼ ἐσκίδναντο ἑὰ πρὸς δώμαθʼ ἕκαστος, μνηστῆρες δʼ ἐς δώματʼ ἴσαν θείου Ὀδυσῆος.
 there is therefore hope that thou wilt accomplish this work. Now then let be the will and counsel of the wooers—fools, for they are in no wise either prudent or just, nor do they know aught of death or black fate, which verily is near at hand for them, that they shall all perish in a day.	Τηλέμαχος δʼ ἀπάνευθε κιὼν ἐπὶ θῖνα θαλάσσης, χεῖρας νιψάμενος πολιῆς ἁλὸς εὔχετʼ Ἀθήνῃ· κλῦθί μευ, ὃ χθιζὸς θεὸς ἤλυθες ἡμέτερον δῶ καί μʼ ἐν νηὶ κέλευσας ἐπʼ ἠεροειδέα πόντον νόστον πευσόμενον πατρὸς δὴν οἰχομένοιο
 But for thyself, the journey on which thy heart is set shall not be long delayed, so true a friend of thy father's house am I, who will equip for thee a swift ship, and myself go with thee. But go thou now to the house and join the company of the wooers; make ready stores, and bestow all in vessels—	ἔρχεσθαι· τὰ δὲ πάντα διατρίβουσιν Ἀχαιοί, μνηστῆρες δὲ μάλιστα κακῶς ὑπερηνορέοντες. ὣς ἔφατʼ εὐχόμενος, σχεδόθεν δέ οἱ ἦλθεν Ἀθήνη, Μέντορι εἰδομένη ἠμὲν δέμας ἠδὲ καὶ αὐδήν, καί μιν φωνήσασʼ ἔπεα πτερόεντα προσηύδα·
wine in jars, and barley meal, the marrow of men, in stout skins;—but I, going through the town, will quickly gather comrades that go willingly. And ships there are full many in sea-girt Ithaca , both new and old; of these will I choose out for thee the one that is best,	Τηλέμαχʼ, οὐδʼ ὄπιθεν κακὸς ἔσσεαι οὐδʼ ἀνοήμων, εἰ δή τοι σοῦ πατρὸς ἐνέστακται μένος ἠύ, οἷος κεῖνος ἔην τελέσαι ἔργον τε ἔπος τε· οὔ τοι ἔπειθʼ ἁλίη ὁδὸς ἔσσεται οὐδʼ ἀτέλεστος. εἰ δʼ οὐ κείνου γʼ ἐσσὶ γόνος καὶ Πηνελοπείης,
and quickly will we make her ready and launch her on the broad deep.” So spoke Athena, daughter of Zeus, nor did Telemachus tarry long after he had heard the voice of the goddess, but went his way to the house, his heart heavy within him. He found there the proud wooers in the halls,	οὐ σέ γʼ ἔπειτα ἔολπα τελευτήσειν, ἃ μενοινᾷς. παῦροι γάρ τοι παῖδες ὁμοῖοι πατρὶ πέλονται, οἱ πλέονες κακίους, παῦροι δέ τε πατρὸς ἀρείους. ἀλλʼ ἐπεὶ οὐδʼ ὄπιθεν κακὸς ἔσσεαι οὐδʼ ἀνοήμων, οὐδέ σε πάγχυ γε μῆτις Ὀδυσσῆος προλέλοιπεν,
flaying goats and singeing swine in the court. And Antinous with a laugh came straight to Telemachus, and clasped his hand, and spoke, and addressed him: “Telemachus, thou braggart, unrestrained in daring, let no more any evil deed or word be in thy heart.	ἐλπωρή τοι ἔπειτα τελευτῆσαι τάδε ἔργα. τῶ νῦν μνηστήρων μὲν ἔα βουλήν τε νόον τε ἀφραδέων, ἐπεὶ οὔ τι νοήμονες οὐδὲ δίκαιοι· οὐδέ τι ἴσασιν θάνατον καὶ κῆρα μέλαιναν, ὃς δή σφι σχεδόν ἐστιν, ἐπʼ ἤματι πάντας ὀλέσθαι.
Nay, I bid thee, eat and drink even as before. All these things the Achaeans will surely provide for thee—the ship and chosen oarsmen—that with speed thou mayest go to sacred Pylos to seek for tidings of thy noble father.” Then wise Telemachus answered him:	σοὶ δʼ ὁδὸς οὐκέτι δηρὸν ἀπέσσεται ἣν σὺ μενοινᾷς· τοῖος γάρ τοι ἑταῖρος ἐγὼ πατρώιός εἰμι, ὅς τοι νῆα θοὴν στελέω καὶ ἅμʼ ἕψομαι αὐτός. ἀλλὰ σὺ μὲν πρὸς δώματʼ ἰὼν μνηστῆρσιν ὁμίλει, ὅπλισσόν τʼ ἤια καὶ ἄγγεσιν ἄρσον ἅπαντα,
 “Antinous, in no wise is it possible for me in your overweening company to sit at meat quietly and to make merry with an easy mind. Is it not enough, ye wooers, that in time past ye wasted many goodly possessions of mine, while I was still a child? But now that I am grown,	οἶνον ἐν ἀμφιφορεῦσι, καὶ ἄλφιτα, μυελὸν ἀνδρῶν, δέρμασιν ἐν πυκινοῖσιν· ἐγὼ δʼ ἀνὰ δῆμον ἑταίρους αἶψʼ ἐθελοντῆρας συλλέξομαι. εἰσὶ δὲ νῆες πολλαὶ ἐν ἀμφιάλῳ Ἰθάκῃ, νέαι ἠδὲ παλαιαί· τάων μέν τοι ἐγὼν ἐπιόψομαι ἥ τις ἀρίστη,
and gain knowledge by hearing the words of others, yea and my spirit waxes within me, I will try how I may hurl forth upon your evil fates, either going to Pylos or here in this land. For go I will, nor shall the journey be in vain whereof I speak, though I voyage in another's ship, since I may not be master of ship or oarsmen.	ὦκα δʼ ἐφοπλίσσαντες ἐνήσομεν εὐρέι πόντῳ. ὣς φάτʼ Ἀθηναίη κούρη Διός· οὐδʼ ἄρʼ ἔτι δὴν Τηλέμαχος παρέμιμνεν, ἐπεὶ θεοῦ ἔκλυεν αὐδήν. βῆ δʼ ἰέναι πρὸς δῶμα, φίλον τετιημένος ἦτορ, εὗρε δʼ ἄρα μνηστῆρας ἀγήνορας ἐν μεγάροισιν,
So, I ween, it seemed to you to be more to your profit.” He spoke, and snatched his hand from the hand of Antinous without more ado, and the wooers were busy with the feast throughout the hall. They mocked and jeered at him in their talk; and thus would one of the proud youths speak:	αἶγας ἀνιεμένους σιάλους θʼ εὕοντας ἐν αὐλῇ. Ἀντίνοος δʼ ἰθὺς γελάσας κίε Τηλεμάχοιο, ἔν τʼ ἄρα οἱ φῦ χειρί, ἔπος τʼ ἔφατʼ ἔκ τʼ ὀνόμαζε· Τηλέμαχʼ ὑψαγόρη, μένος ἄσχετε, μή τί τοι ἄλλο ἐν στήθεσσι κακὸν μελέτω ἔργον τε ἔπος τε,
“Aye, verily Telemachus is planning our murder. He will bring men to aid him from sandy Pylos or even from Sparta , so terribly is he set upon it. Or he means to go to Ephyre, that rich land, to bring from thence deadly drugs,	ἀλλά μοι ἐσθιέμεν καὶ πινέμεν, ὡς τὸ πάρος περ. ταῦτα δέ τοι μάλα πάντα τελευτήσουσιν Ἀχαιοί, νῆα καὶ ἐξαίτους ἐρέτας, ἵνα θᾶσσον ἵκηαι ἐς Πύλον ἠγαθέην μετʼ ἀγαυοῦ πατρὸς ἀκουήν. τὸν δʼ αὖ Τηλέμαχος πεπνυμένος ἀντίον ηὔδα·
that he may cast them in the wine-bowl, and destroy us all.” And again another of the proud youths would say: “Who knows but he himself as he goes on the hollow ship may perish wandering far from his friends, even as Odysseus did? So would he cause us yet more labour;	Ἀντίνοʼ, οὔ πως ἔστιν ὑπερφιάλοισι μεθʼ ὑμῖν δαίνυσθαί τʼ ἀκέοντα καὶ εὐφραίνεσθαι ἕκηλον. ἦ οὐχ ἅλις ὡς τὸ πάροιθεν ἐκείρετε πολλὰ καὶ ἐσθλὰ κτήματʼ ἐμά, μνηστῆρες, ἐγὼ δʼ ἔτι νήπιος ἦα; νῦν δʼ ὅτε δὴ μέγας εἰμὶ καὶ ἄλλων μῦθον ἀκούων
for we should have to divide all his possessions, and his house we should give to his mother to possess, and to him who should wed her.” So they spoke, but Telemachus went down to the high-roofed treasure-chamber of his father, a wide room where gold and bronze lay piled, and raiment in chests, and stores of fragrant oil.	πυνθάνομαι, καὶ δή μοι ἀέξεται ἔνδοθι θυμός, πειρήσω, ὥς κʼ ὔμμι κακὰς ἐπὶ κῆρας ἰήλω, ἠὲ Πύλονδʼ ἐλθών, ἢ αὐτοῦ τῷδʼ ἐνὶ δήμῳ. εἶμι μέν, οὐδʼ ἁλίη ὁδὸς ἔσσεται ἣν ἀγορεύω, ἔμπορος· οὐ γὰρ νηὸς ἐπήβολος οὐδʼ ἐρετάων
 There, too, stood great jars of wine, old and sweet, holding within them an unmixed divine drink, and ranged in order along the wall, if ever Odysseus should return home even after many grievous toils. Shut were	γίγνομαι· ὥς νύ που ὔμμιν ἐείσατο κέρδιον εἶναι. ἦ ῥα, καὶ ἐκ χειρὸς χεῖρα σπάσατʼ Ἀντινόοιο ῥεῖα· μνηστῆρες δὲ δόμον κάτα δαῖτα πένοντο. οἱ δʼ ἐπελώβευον καὶ ἐκερτόμεον ἐπέεσσιν. ὧδε δέ τις εἴπεσκε νέων ὑπερηνορεόντων·
the double doors, close-fitted; and there both night and day a stewardess abode, who guarded all in wisdom of mind, Eurycleia, daughter of Ops, son of Peisenor. To her now Telemachus, when he had called her to the treasure-chamber, spoke, and said: “Nurse, draw me off wine in jars,	ἦ μάλα Τηλέμαχος φόνον ἡμῖν μερμηρίζει. ἤ τινας ἐκ Πύλου ἄξει ἀμύντορας ἠμαθόεντος ἢ ὅ γε καὶ Σπάρτηθεν, ἐπεί νύ περ ἵεται αἰνῶς· ἠὲ καὶ εἰς Ἐφύρην ἐθέλει, πίειραν ἄρουραν, ἐλθεῖν, ὄφρʼ ἔνθεν θυμοφθόρα φάρμακʼ ἐνείκῃ,
 sweet wine that is the choicest next to that which thou guardest ever thinking upon that ill-fated one, if haply Zeus-born Odysseus may come I know not whence, having escaped from death and the fates. Fill twelve jars and fit them all with covers, and pour me barley meal into well-sewn skins,	ἐν δὲ βάλῃ κρητῆρι καὶ ἡμέας πάντας ὀλέσσῃ. ἄλλος δʼ αὖτʼ εἴπεσκε νέων ὑπερηνορεόντων· τίς δʼ οἶδʼ, εἴ κε καὶ αὐτὸς ἰὼν κοίλης ἐπὶ νηὸς τῆλε φίλων ἀπόληται ἀλώμενος ὥς περ Ὀδυσσεύς; οὕτω κεν καὶ μᾶλλον ὀφέλλειεν πόνον ἄμμιν·
and let there be twenty measures of ground barley meal. But keep knowledge hereof to thyself, and have all these things brought together; for at evening I will fetch them, when my mother goes to her upper chamber and bethinks her of her rest. For I am going to Sparta and to sandy Pylos	κτήματα γάρ κεν πάντα δασαίμεθα, οἰκία δʼ αὖτε τούτου μητέρι δοῖμεν ἔχειν ἠδʼ ὅς τις ὀπυίοι. ὣς φάν, ὁ δʼ ὑψόροφον θάλαμον κατεβήσετο πατρὸς εὐρύν, ὅθι νητὸς χρυσὸς καὶ χαλκὸς ἔκειτο ἐσθής τʼ ἐν χηλοῖσιν ἅλις τʼ ἐυῶδες ἔλαιον·
to seek tidings of the return of my dear father, if haply I may hear any.” So he spoke, and the dear nurse, Eurycleia, uttered a shrill cry, and weeping spoke to him winged words:“Ah, dear child, how has this thought come into thy mind? Whither art thou minded to go over the wide earth,	ἐν δὲ πίθοι οἴνοιο παλαιοῦ ἡδυπότοιο ἕστασαν, ἄκρητον θεῖον ποτὸν ἐντὸς ἔχοντες, ἑξείης ποτὶ τοῖχον ἀρηρότες, εἴ ποτʼ Ὀδυσσεὺς οἴκαδε νοστήσειε καὶ ἄλγεα πολλὰ μογήσας. κληισταὶ δʼ ἔπεσαν σανίδες πυκινῶς ἀραρυῖαι,
 thou who art an only son and well-beloved? But he hath perished far from his country, the Zeus-born Odysseus, in a strange land; and these men, so soon as thou art gone, will devise evil for thee hereafter, that thou mayest perish by guile, and themselves divide all these possessions. Nay, abide here in charge of what is thine; thou hast no need	δικλίδες· ἐν δὲ γυνὴ ταμίη νύκτας τε καὶ ἦμαρ ἔσχʼ, ἣ πάντʼ ἐφύλασσε νόου πολυϊδρείῃσιν, Εὐρύκλειʼ, Ὦπος θυγάτηρ Πεισηνορίδαο. τὴν τότε Τηλέμαχος προσέφη θαλαμόνδε καλέσσας· μαῖʼ, ἄγε δή μοι οἶνον ἐν ἀμφιφορεῦσιν ἄφυσσον
to suffer ills and go a wanderer over the unresting sea.” Then wise Telemachus answered her: “Take heart, nurse, for not without a god's warrant is this my plan. But swear to tell naught of this to my dear mother until the eleventh or twelfth day shall come,	ἡδύν, ὅτις μετὰ τὸν λαρώτατος ὃν σὺ φυλάσσεις κεῖνον ὀιομένη τὸν κάμμορον, εἴ ποθεν ἔλθοι διογενὴς Ὀδυσεὺς θάνατον καὶ κῆρας ἀλύξας. δώδεκα δʼ ἔμπλησον καὶ πώμασιν ἄρσον ἅπαντας. ἐν δέ μοι ἄλφιτα χεῦον ἐϋρραφέεσσι δοροῖσιν·
or until she shall herself miss me and hear that I am gone, that she may not mar her fair flesh with weeping.” So he spoke, and the old woman swore a great oath by the gods to say naught. But when she had sworn and made an end of the oath, straightway she drew for him wine in jars,	εἴκοσι δʼ ἔστω μέτρα μυληφάτου ἀλφίτου ἀκτῆς. αὐτὴ δʼ οἴη ἴσθι· τὰ δʼ ἁθρόα πάντα τετύχθω· ἑσπέριος γὰρ ἐγὼν αἱρήσομαι, ὁππότε κεν δὴ μήτηρ εἰς ὑπερῷʼ ἀναβῇ κοίτου τε μέδηται. εἶμι γὰρ ἐς Σπάρτην τε καὶ ἐς Πύλον ἠμαθόεντα
and poured barley meal into well-sewn skins; and Telemachus went to the hall and joined the company of the wooers. Then the goddess, flashing-eyed Athena, took other counsel. In the likeness of Telemachus she went everywhere throughout the city, and to each of the men she drew near and spoke her word,	νόστον πευσόμενος πατρὸς φίλου, ἤν που ἀκούσω. ὣς φάτο, κώκυσεν δὲ φίλη τροφὸς Εὐρύκλεια, καί ῥʼ ὀλοφυρομένη ἔπεα πτερόεντα προσηύδα· τίπτε δέ τοι, φίλε τέκνον, ἐνὶ φρεσὶ τοῦτο νόημα ἔπλετο; πῇ δʼ ἐθέλεις ἰέναι πολλὴν ἐπὶ γαῖαν
bidding them gather at even beside the swift ship. Furthermore, of Noemon, the glorious son of Phronius, she asked a swift ship, and he promised it to her with a ready heart. Now the sun set and all the ways grew dark. Then she drew the swift ship to the sea and	μοῦνος ἐὼν ἀγαπητός; ὁ δʼ ὤλετο τηλόθι πάτρης διογενὴς Ὀδυσεὺς ἀλλογνώτῳ ἐνὶ δήμῳ. οἱ δέ τοι αὐτίκʼ ἰόντι κακὰ φράσσονται ὀπίσσω, ὥς κε δόλῳ φθίῃς, τάδε δʼ αὐτοὶ πάντα δάσονται. ἀλλὰ μένʼ αὖθʼ ἐπὶ σοῖσι καθήμενος· οὐδέ τί σε χρὴ
put in it all the gear that well-benched ships carry. And she moored it at the mouth of the harbor, and round about it the goodly company was gathered together, and the goddess heartened each man. Then again the goddess, flashing-eyed Athena, took other counsel. She went her way to the house of divine Odysseus,	πόντον ἐπʼ ἀτρύγετον κακὰ πάσχειν οὐδʼ ἀλάλησθαι. τὴν δʼ αὖ Τηλέμαχος πεπνυμένος ἀντίον ηὔδα· θάρσει, μαῖʼ, ἐπεὶ οὔ τοι ἄνευ θεοῦ ἥδε γε βουλή. ἀλλʼ ὄμοσον μὴ μητρὶ φίλῃ τάδε μυθήσασθαι, πρίν γʼ ὅτʼ ἂν ἑνδεκάτη τε δυωδεκάτη τε γένηται,
 and there began to shed sweet sleep upon the wooers and made them to wander in their drinking, and from their hands she cast the cups. But they rose to go to their rest throughout the city, and remained no long time seated, for sleep was falling upon their eyelids. But to Telemachus spoke flashing-eyed Athena,	ἢ αὐτὴν ποθέσαι καὶ ἀφορμηθέντος ἀκοῦσαι, ὡς ἂν μὴ κλαίουσα κατὰ χρόα καλὸν ἰάπτῃ. ὣς ἄρʼ ἔφη, γρῆυς δὲ θεῶν μέγαν ὅρκον ἀπώμνυ. αὐτὰρ ἐπεί ῥʼ ὄμοσέν τε τελεύτησέν τε τὸν ὅρκον, αὐτίκʼ ἔπειτά οἱ οἶνον ἐν ἀμφιφορεῦσιν ἄφυσσεν,
calling him forth before the stately hall, having likened herself to Mentor both in form and in voice: “Telemachus, already thy well-greaved comrades sit at the oar and await thy setting out. Come, let us go, that we may not long delay their journey.”	ἐν δέ οἱ ἄλφιτα χεῦεν ἐϋρραφέεσσι δοροῖσι. Τηλέμαχος δʼ ἐς δώματʼ ἰὼν μνηστῆρσιν ὁμίλει. ἔνθʼ αὖτʼ ἄλλʼ ἐνόησε θεά, γλαυκῶπις Ἀθήνη. Τηλεμάχῳ ἐικυῖα κατὰ πτόλιν ᾤχετο πάντῃ, καί ῥα ἑκάστῳ φωτὶ παρισταμένη φάτο μῦθον,
So saying, Pallas Athena led the way quickly, and he followed in the footsteps of the goddess. Now when they had come down to the ship and to the sea, they found on the shore their long-haired comrades, and the strong and mighty Telemachus spoke among them:	ἑσπερίους δʼ ἐπὶ νῆα θοὴν ἀγέρεσθαι ἀνώγει. ἡ δʼ αὖτε Φρονίοιο Νοήμονα φαίδιμον υἱὸν ᾔτεε νῆα θοήν· ὁ δέ οἱ πρόφρων ὑπέδεκτο. δύσετό τʼ ἠέλιος σκιόωντό τε πᾶσαι ἀγυιαί, καὶ τότε νῆα θοὴν ἅλαδʼ εἴρυσε, πάντα δʼ ἐν αὐτῇ
“Come, friends, let us fetch the stores, for all are now gathered together in the hall. My mother knows naught hereof, nor the handmaids either: one only heard my word.” Thus saying, he led the way, and they went along with him. So they brought and	ὅπλʼ ἐτίθει, τά τε νῆες ἐύσσελμοι φορέουσι. στῆσε δʼ ἐπʼ ἐσχατιῇ λιμένος, περὶ δʼ ἐσθλοὶ ἑταῖροι ἁθρόοι ἠγερέθοντο· θεὰ δʼ ὤτρυνεν ἕκαστον. ἔνθʼ αὖτʼ ἄλλʼ ἐνόησε θεά, γλαυκῶπις Ἀθήνη. βῆ ῤʼ ἰέναι πρὸς δώματʼ Ὀδυσσῆος θείοιο·
 stowed everything in the well-benched ship, as the dear son of Odysseus bade. Then on board the ship stepped Telemachus, and Athena went before him and sat down in the stern of the ship, and near her sat Telemachus, while the men loosed the stern cables and themselves stepped on board, and sat down upon the benches.	ἔνθα μνηστήρεσσιν ἐπὶ γλυκὺν ὕπνον ἔχευε, πλάζε δὲ πίνοντας, χειρῶν δʼ ἔκβαλλε κύπελλα. οἱ δʼ εὕδειν ὤρνυντο κατὰ πτόλιν, οὐδʼ ἄρʼ ἔτι δὴν ἥατʼ, ἐπεί σφισιν ὕπνος ἐπὶ βλεφάροισιν ἔπιπτεν. αὐτὰρ Τηλέμαχον προσέφη γλαυκῶπις Ἀθήνη
 And flashing-eyed Athena sent them a favorable wind, a strong-blowing West wind that sang over the wine-dark sea. And Telemachus called to his men, and bade them lay hold of the tackling, and they hearkened to his call. The mast of fir	ἐκπροκαλεσσαμένη μεγάρων ἐὺ ναιεταόντων, Μέντορι εἰδομένη ἠμὲν δέμας ἠδὲ καὶ αὐδήν· Τηλέμαχʼ, ἤδη μέν τοι ἐυκνήμιδες ἑταῖροι ἥατʼ ἐπήρετμοι τὴν σὴν ποτιδέγμενοι ὁρμήν· ἀλλʼ ἴομεν, μὴ δηθὰ διατρίβωμεν ὁδοῖο.
 they raised and set in the hollow socket, and made it fast with fore-stays, and hauled up the white sail with twisted thongs of ox-hide. So the wind filled the belly of the sail, and the dark wave sang loudly about the stem of the ship as she went, and she sped over the wave accomplishing her way.	ὣς ἄρα φωνήσασʼ ἡγήσατο Παλλὰς Ἀθήνη καρπαλίμως· ὁ δʼ ἔπειτα μετʼ ἴχνια βαῖνε θεοῖο. αὐτὰρ ἐπεί ῥʼ ἐπὶ νῆα κατήλυθον ἠδὲ θάλασσαν, εὗρον ἔπειτʼ ἐπὶ θινὶ κάρη κομόωντας ἑταίρους. τοῖσι δὲ καὶ μετέειφʼ ἱερὴ ἲς Τηλεμάχοιο·
 Then, when they had made the tackling fast in the swift black ship, they set forth bowls brim full of wine, and poured libations to the immortal gods that are forever, and chiefest of all to the flashing-eyed daughter of Zeus. So all night long and through the dawn the ship cleft her way.	δεῦτε, φίλοι, ἤια φερώμεθα· πάντα γὰρ ἤδη ἁθρόʼ ἐνὶ μεγάρῳ. μήτηρ δʼ ἐμὴ οὔ τι πέπυσται, οὐδʼ ἄλλαι δμωαί, μία δʼ οἴη μῦθον ἄκουσεν. ὣς ἄρα φωνήσας ἡγήσατο, τοὶ δʼ ἅμʼ ἕποντο. οἱ δʼ ἄρα πάντα φέροντες ἐυσσέλμῳ ἐπὶ νηὶ
And now the sun, leaving the beauteous mere, sprang up into the brazen heaven to give light to the immortals and to mortal men on the earth, the giver of grain; and they came to Pylos , the well-built citadel of Neleus.	τοῖσιν δʼ ἴκμενον οὖρον ἵει γλαυκῶπις Ἀθήνη, ἀκραῆ Ζέφυρον, κελάδοντʼ ἐπὶ οἴνοπα πόντον. Τηλέμαχος δʼ ἑτάροισιν ἐποτρύνας ἐκέλευσεν ὅπλων ἅπτεσθαι· τοὶ δʼ ὀτρύνοντος ἄκουσαν. ἱστὸν δʼ εἰλάτινον κοίλης ἔντοσθε μεσόδμης
 Here the townsfolk on the shore of the sea were offering sacrifice of black bulls to the dark-haired Earth-shaker. Nine companies there were, and five hundred men sat in each, and in each they held nine bulls ready for sacrifice. Now when they had tasted the inner parts and were burning the thigh-pieces to the god,	στῆσαν ἀείραντες, κατὰ δὲ προτόνοισιν ἔδησαν, ἕλκον δʼ ἱστία λευκὰ ἐυστρέπτοισι βοεῦσιν. ἔπρησεν δʼ ἄνεμος μέσον ἱστίον, ἀμφὶ δὲ κῦμα στείρῃ πορφύρεον μεγάλʼ ἴαχε νηὸς ἰούσης· ἡ δʼ ἔθεεν κατὰ κῦμα διαπρήσσουσα κέλευθον.
the others put straight in to the shore, and hauled up and furled the sail of the shapely ship, and moored her, and themselves stepped forth. Forth too from the ship stepped Telemachus, and Athena led the way. And the goddess, flashing-eyed Athena, spake first to him, and said: “Telemachus, no longer hast thou need to feel shame, no, not a whit.	δησάμενοι δʼ ἄρα ὅπλα θοὴν ἀνὰ νῆα μέλαιναν στήσαντο κρητῆρας ἐπιστεφέας οἴνοιο, λεῖβον δʼ ἀθανάτοισι θεοῖς αἰειγενέτῃσιν, ἐκ πάντων δὲ μάλιστα Διὸς γλαυκώπιδι κούρῃ. παννυχίη μέν ῥʼ ἥ γε καὶ ἠῶ πεῖρε κέλευθον.
A lie will he not utter, for he is wise indeed.” Then wise Telemachus answered her: “Mentor, how shall I go, and how shall I greet him? I am as yet all unversed in subtle speech, and moreover a young man has shame to question an elder.”	Ἠέλιος δʼ ἀνόρουσε, λιπὼν περικαλλέα λίμνην, οὐρανὸν ἐς πολύχαλκον, ἵνʼ ἀθανάτοισι φαείνοι καὶ θνητοῖσι βροτοῖσιν ἐπὶ ζείδωρον ἄρουραν· οἱ δὲ Πύλον, Νηλῆος ἐυκτίμενον πτολίεθρον,
Then the goddess, flashing-eyed Athena, answered him: “Telemachus, somewhat thou wilt of thyself devise in thy breast, and somewhat heaven too will prompt thee. For, methinks, not without the favour of the gods hast thou been born and reared.” So spake Pallas Athena, and led the way	ἷξον· τοὶ δʼ ἐπὶ θινὶ θαλάσσης ἱερὰ ῥέζον, ταύρους παμμέλανας, ἐνοσίχθονι κυανοχαίτῃ. ἐννέα δʼ ἕδραι ἔσαν, πεντακόσιοι δʼ ἐν ἑκάστῃ ἥατο καὶ προύχοντο ἑκάστοθι ἐννέα ταύρους. εὖθʼ οἱ σπλάγχνα πάσαντο, θεῷ δʼ ἐπὶ μηρίʼ ἔκαιον,
quickly; but he followed in the footsteps of the goddess; and they came to the gathering and the companies of the men of Pylos . There Nestor sat with his sons, and round about his people, making ready the feast, were roasting some of the meat and putting other pieces on spits. But when they saw the strangers they all came thronging about them,	οἱ δʼ ἰθὺς κατάγοντο ἰδʼ ἱστία νηὸς ἐίσης στεῖλαν ἀείραντες, τὴν δʼ ὥρμισαν, ἐκ δʼ ἔβαν αὐτοί· ἐκ δʼ ἄρα Τηλέμαχος νηὸς βαῖνʼ, ἦρχε δʼ Ἀθήνη. τὸν προτέρη προσέειπε θεά, γλαυκῶπις Ἀθήνη· Τηλέμαχʼ, οὐ μέν σε χρὴ ἔτʼ αἰδοῦς, οὐδʼ ἠβαιόν·
 and clasped their hands in welcome, and bade them sit down. First Nestor's son Peisistratus came near and took both by the hand, and made them to sit down at the feast on soft fleeces upon the sand of the sea, beside his brother Thrasymedes and his father.	τοὔνεκα γὰρ καὶ πόντον ἐπέπλως, ὄφρα πύθηαι πατρός, ὅπου κύθε γαῖα καὶ ὅν τινα πότμον ἐπέσπεν. ἀλλʼ ἄγε νῦν ἰθὺς κίε Νέστορος ἱπποδάμοιο· εἴδομεν ἥν τινα μῆτιν ἐνὶ στήθεσσι κέκευθε. λίσσεσθαι δέ μιν αὐτός, ὅπως νημερτέα εἴπῃ·
Thereupon he gave them portions of the inner meat and poured wine in a golden cup, and, pledging her, he spoke to Pallas Athena, daughter of Zeus who bears the aegis: “Pray now, stranger, to the lord Poseidon, for his is the feast whereon you have chanced in coming hither.	ψεῦδος δʼ οὐκ ἐρέει· μάλα γὰρ πεπνυμένος ἐστί. τὴν δʼ αὖ Τηλέμαχος πεπνυμένος ἀντίον ηὔδα· Μέντορ, πῶς τʼ ἄρʼ ἴω; πῶς τʼ ἂρ προσπτύξομαι αὐτόν; οὐδέ τί πω μύθοισι πεπείρημαι πυκινοῖσιν· αἰδὼς δʼ αὖ νέον ἄνδρα γεραίτερον ἐξερέεσθαι.
 And when thou hast poured libations and hast prayed, as is fitting, then give thy friend also the cup of honey-sweet wine that he may pour, since he too, I ween, prays to the immortals; for all men have need of the gods. Howbeit he is the younger, of like age with myself,	τὸν δʼ αὖτε προσέειπε θεά, γλαυκῶπις Ἀθήνη· Τηλέμαχʼ, ἄλλα μὲν αὐτὸς ἐνὶ φρεσὶ σῇσι νοήσεις, ἄλλα δὲ καὶ δαίμων ὑποθήσεται· οὐ γὰρ ὀίω οὔ σε θεῶν ἀέκητι γενέσθαι τε τραφέμεν τε. ὣς ἄρα φωνήσασʼ ἡγήσατο Παλλὰς Ἀθήνη
wherefore to thee first will I give the golden cup.” So he spake, and placed in her hand the cup of sweet wine. But Pallas Athena rejoiced at the man's wisdom and judgment, in that to her first he gave the golden cup; and straightway she prayed earnestly to the lord Poseidon:	καρπαλίμως· ὁ δʼ ἔπειτα μετʼ ἴχνια βαῖνε θεοῖο. ἷξον δʼ ἐς Πυλίων ἀνδρῶν ἄγυρίν τε καὶ ἕδρας, ἔνθʼ ἄρα Νέστωρ ἧστο σὺν υἱάσιν, ἀμφὶ δʼ ἑταῖροι δαῖτʼ ἐντυνόμενοι κρέα τʼ ὤπτων ἄλλα τʼ ἔπειρον. οἱ δʼ ὡς οὖν ξείνους ἴδον, ἁθρόοι ἦλθον ἅπαντες,
“Hear me, Poseidon, thou Earth-enfolder, and grudge not in answer to our prayer to bring these deeds to fulfillment. To Nestor, first of all, and to his sons vouchsafe renown, and then do thou grant to the rest gracious requital for this glorious hecatomb, even to all the men of Pylos ;	χερσίν τʼ ἠσπάζοντο καὶ ἑδριάασθαι ἄνωγον. πρῶτος Νεστορίδης Πεισίστρατος ἐγγύθεν ἐλθὼν ἀμφοτέρων ἕλε χεῖρα καὶ ἵδρυσεν παρὰ δαιτὶ κώεσιν ἐν μαλακοῖσιν ἐπὶ ψαμάθοις ἁλίῃσιν πάρ τε κασιγνήτῳ Θρασυμήδεϊ καὶ πατέρι ᾧ·
and grant furthermore that Telemachus and I may return when we have accomplished all that for which we came hither with our swift black ship.” Thus she prayed, and was herself fulfilling all. Then she gave Telemachus the fair two-handled cup, and in like manner the dear son of Odysseus prayed.	δῶκε δʼ ἄρα σπλάγχνων μοίρας, ἐν δʼ οἶνον ἔχευεν χρυσείῳ δέπαϊ· δειδισκόμενος δὲ προσηύδα Παλλάδʼ Ἀθηναίην κούρην Διὸς αἰγιόχοιο· εὔχεο νῦν, ὦ ξεῖνε, Ποσειδάωνι ἄνακτι· τοῦ γὰρ καὶ δαίτης ἠντήσατε δεῦρο μολόντες.
Then when they had roasted the outer flesh and drawn it off the spits, they divided the portions and feasted a glorious feast. But when they had put from them the desire of food and drink, the horseman, Nestor of Gerenia , spoke first among them: “Now verily is it seemlier to ask and enquire	αὐτὰρ ἐπὴν σπείσῃς τε καὶ εὔξεαι, ἣ θέμις ἐστί, δὸς καὶ τούτῳ ἔπειτα δέπας μελιηδέος οἴνου σπεῖσαι, ἐπεὶ καὶ τοῦτον ὀίομαι ἀθανάτοισιν εὔχεσθαι· πάντες δὲ θεῶν χατέουσʼ ἄνθρωποι. ἀλλὰ νεώτερός ἐστιν, ὁμηλικίη δʼ ἐμοὶ αὐτῷ·
of the strangers who they are, since now they have had their joy of food. Strangers, who are ye? Whence do ye sail over the watery ways? Is it on some business, or do ye wander at random over the sea, even as pirates, who wander hazarding their lives and bringing evil to men of other lands?”	τοὔνεκα σοὶ προτέρῳ δώσω χρύσειον ἄλεισον. ὣς εἰπὼν ἐν χειρὶ τίθει δέπας ἡδέος οἴνου· χαῖρε δʼ Ἀθηναίη πεπνυμένῳ ἀνδρὶ δικαίῳ, οὕνεκα οἷ προτέρῃ δῶκε χρύσειον ἄλεισον· αὐτίκα δʼ εὔχετο πολλὰ Ποσειδάωνι ἄνακτι·
Then wise Telemachus took courage, and made answer, for Athena herself put courage in his heart, that he might ask about his father that was gone, and that good report might be his among men: “Nestor, son of Neleus, great glory of the Achaeans,	κλῦθι, Ποσείδαον γαιήοχε, μηδὲ μεγήρῃς ἡμῖν εὐχομένοισι τελευτῆσαι τάδε ἔργα. Νέστορι μὲν πρώτιστα καὶ υἱάσι κῦδος ὄπαζε, αὐτὰρ ἔπειτʼ ἄλλοισι δίδου χαρίεσσαν ἀμοιβὴν σύμπασιν Πυλίοισιν ἀγακλειτῆς ἑκατόμβης.
thou askest whence we are, and I will surely tell thee. We have come from Ithaca that is below Neion; but this business whereof I speak is mine own, and concerns not the people. I come after the wide-spread rumor of my father, if haply I may hear of it, even of goodly Odysseus of the steadfast heart, who once, men say,	δὸς δʼ ἔτι Τηλέμαχον καὶ ἐμὲ πρήξαντα νέεσθαι, οὕνεκα δεῦρʼ ἱκόμεσθα θοῇ σὺν νηὶ μελαίνῃ. ὣς ἄρʼ ἔπειτʼ ἠρᾶτο καὶ αὐτὴ πάντα τελεύτα. δῶκε δὲ Τηλεμάχῳ καλὸν δέπας ἀμφικύπελλον· ὣς δʼ αὔτως ἠρᾶτο Ὀδυσσῆος φίλος υἱός.
 fought by thy side and sacked the city of the Trojans. For of all men else, as many as warred with the Trojans, we learn where each man died a woeful death, but of him the son of Cronos has made even the death to be past learning; for no man can tell surely where he hath died,—	οἱ δʼ ἐπεὶ ὤπτησαν κρέʼ ὑπέρτερα καὶ ἐρύσαντο, μοίρας δασσάμενοι δαίνυντʼ ἐρικυδέα δαῖτα. αὐτὰρ ἐπεὶ πόσιος καὶ ἐδητύος ἐξ ἔρον ἕντο, τοῖς ἄρα μύθων ἦρχε Γερήνιος ἱππότα Νέστωρ· νῦν δὴ κάλλιόν ἐστι μεταλλῆσαι καὶ ἐρέσθαι
 whether he was overcome by foes on the mainland, or on the deep among the waves of Amphitrite. Therefore am I now come to thy knees, if perchance thou wilt be willing to tell me of his woeful death, whether thou sawest it haply with thine own eyes, or didst hear from some other the story	ξείνους, οἱ τινές εἰσιν, ἐπεὶ τάρπησαν ἐδωδῆς. ὦ ξεῖνοι, τίνες ἐστέ; πόθεν πλεῖθʼ ὑγρὰ κέλευθα; ἤ τι κατὰ πρῆξιν ἦ μαψιδίως ἀλάλησθε οἷά τε ληιστῆρες ὑπεὶρ ἅλα, τοί τʼ ἀλόωνται ψυχὰς παρθέμενοι κακὸν ἀλλοδαποῖσι φέροντες;
of his wanderings; for beyond all men did his mother bear him to sorrow. And do thou nowise out of ruth or pity for me speak soothing words, but tell me truly how thou didst come to behold him. I beseech thee, if ever my father, noble Odysseus, promised aught to thee of word or deed and fulfilled it	τὸν δʼ αὖ Τηλέμαχος πεπνυμένος ἀντίον ηὔδα θαρσήσας· αὐτὴ γὰρ ἐνὶ φρεσὶ θάρσος Ἀθήνη θῆχʼ, ἵνα μιν περὶ πατρὸς ἀποιχομένοιο ἔροιτο ἠδʼ ἵνα μιν κλέος ἐσθλὸν ἐν ἀνθρώποισιν ἔχῃσιν· ὦ Νέστορ Νηληϊάδη, μέγα κῦδος Ἀχαιῶν,
in the land of the Trojans, where you Achaeans suffered woes, be mindful of it now, I pray thee, and tell me the very truth.” Then the horseman, Nestor of Gerenia , answered him: “My friend, since thou hast recalled to my mind the sorrow which we endured in that land, we sons of the Achaeans, unrestrained in daring,—	εἴρεαι ὁππόθεν εἰμέν· ἐγὼ δέ κέ τοι καταλέξω. ἡμεῖς ἐξ Ἰθάκης ὑπονηίου εἰλήλουθμεν· πρῆξις δʼ ἥδʼ ἰδίη, οὐ δήμιος, ἣν ἀγορεύω. πατρὸς ἐμοῦ κλέος εὐρὺ μετέρχομαι, ἤν που ἀκούσω, δίου Ὀδυσσῆος ταλασίφρονος, ὅν ποτέ φασι
 all that we endured on shipboard, as we roamed after booty over the misty deep whithersoever Achilles led; and all our fightings around the great city of king Priam;—lo, there all our best were slain. There lies warlike Aias, there Achilles,	σὺν σοὶ μαρνάμενον Τρώων πόλιν ἐξαλαπάξαι. ἄλλους μὲν γὰρ πάντας, ὅσοι Τρωσὶν πολέμιζον, πευθόμεθʼ, ἧχι ἕκαστος ἀπώλετο λυγρῷ ὀλέθρῳ, κείνου δʼ αὖ καὶ ὄλεθρον ἀπευθέα θῆκε Κρονίων. οὐ γάρ τις δύναται σάφα εἰπέμεν ὁππόθʼ ὄλωλεν,
 there Patroclus, the peer of the gods in counsel; and there my own dear son, strong alike and peerless, Antilochus, pre-eminent in speed of foot and as a warrior. Aye, and many other ills we suffered besides these; who of mortal men could tell them all?	εἴθʼ ὅ γʼ ἐπʼ ἠπείρου δάμη ἀνδράσι δυσμενέεσσιν, εἴτε καὶ ἐν πελάγει μετὰ κύμασιν Ἀμφιτρίτης. τοὔνεκα νῦν τὰ σὰ γούναθʼ ἱκάνομαι, αἴ κʼ ἐθέλῃσθα κείνου λυγρὸν ὄλεθρον ἐνισπεῖν, εἴ που ὄπωπας ὀφθαλμοῖσι τεοῖσιν ἢ ἄλλου μῦθον ἄκουσας
 Nay, if for five years' space or six years' space thou wert to abide here, and ask of all the woes which the goodly Achaeans endured there, thou wouldest grow weary ere the end and get thee back to thy native land. For nine years' space were we busied plotting their ruin with all manner of wiles; and hardly did the son of Cronos bring it to pass.	πλαζομένου· πέρι γάρ μιν ὀιζυρὸν τέκε μήτηρ. μηδέ τί μʼ αἰδόμενος μειλίσσεο μηδʼ ἐλεαίρων, ἀλλʼ εὖ μοι κατάλεξον ὅπως ἤντησας ὀπωπῆς. λίσσομαι, εἴ ποτέ τοί τι πατὴρ ἐμός, ἐσθλὸς Ὀδυσσεύς, ἢ ἔπος ἠέ τι ἔργον ὑποστὰς ἐξετέλεσσε
 There no man ventured to vie with him in counsel, since goodly Odysseus far excelled in all manner of wiles,—thy father, if indeed thou art his son. Amazement holds me as I look on thee, for verily thy speech is like his; nor would one think	δήμῳ ἔνι Τρώων, ὅθι πάσχετε πήματʼ Ἀχαιοί, τῶν νῦν μοι μνῆσαι, καί μοι νημερτὲς ἐνίσπες. τὸν δʼ ἠμείβετʼ ἔπειτα Γερήνιος ἱππότα Νέστωρ· ὦ φίλʼ, ἐπεί μʼ ἔμνησας ὀιζύος, ἣν ἐν ἐκείνῳ δήμῳ ἀνέτλημεν μένος ἄσχετοι υἷες Ἀχαιῶν,
 that a younger man would speak so like him. Now all the time that we were there goodly Odysseus and I never spoke at variance either in the assembly or in the council, but being of one mind advised the Argives with wisdom and shrewd counsel how all might be for the best.	ἠμὲν ὅσα ξὺν νηυσὶν ἐπʼ ἠεροειδέα πόντον πλαζόμενοι κατὰ ληίδʼ, ὅπῃ ἄρξειεν Ἀχιλλεύς, ἠδʼ ὅσα καὶ περὶ ἄστυ μέγα Πριάμοιο ἄνακτος μαρνάμεθʼ· ἔνθα δʼ ἔπειτα κατέκταθεν ὅσσοι ἄριστοι. ἔνθα μὲν Αἴας κεῖται ἀρήιος, ἔνθα δʼ Ἀχιλλεύς,
 But when we had sacked the lofty city of Priam, and had gone away in our ships, and a god had scattered the Achaeans, then, even then, Zeus planned in his heart a woeful return for the Argives, for in no wise prudent or just were all. Wherefore many of them met an evil fate	ἔνθα δὲ Πάτροκλος, θεόφιν μήστωρ ἀτάλαντος, ἔνθα δʼ ἐμὸς φίλος υἱός, ἅμα κρατερὸς καὶ ἀμύμων, Ἀντίλοχος, πέρι μὲν θείειν ταχὺς ἠδὲ μαχητής· ἄλλα τε πόλλʼ ἐπὶ τοῖς πάθομεν κακά· τίς κεν ἐκεῖνα πάντα γε μυθήσαιτο καταθνητῶν ἀνθρώπων;
 through the fell wrath of the flashing-eyed goddess, the daughter of the mighty sire, for she caused strife between the two sons of Atreus. Now these two called to an assembly all the Achaeans, recklessly and in no due order, at set of sun—and they came heavy with wine, the sons of the Achaeans,—	οὐδʼ εἰ πεντάετές γε καὶ ἑξάετες παραμίμνων ἐξερέοις ὅσα κεῖθι πάθον κακὰ δῖοι Ἀχαιοί· πρίν κεν ἀνιηθεὶς σὴν πατρίδα γαῖαν ἵκοιο. εἰνάετες γάρ σφιν κακὰ ῥάπτομεν ἀμφιέποντες παντοίοισι δόλοισι, μόγις δʼ ἐτέλεσσε Κρονίων.
and they spoke their word, and told wherefore they had gathered the host together. Then in truth Menelaus bade all the Achaeans think of their return over the broad back of the sea, but in no wise did he please Agamemnon, for he was fain to hold back the host and to offer holy hecatombs,	ἔνθʼ οὔ τίς ποτε μῆτιν ὁμοιωθήμεναι ἄντην ἤθελʼ, ἐπεὶ μάλα πολλὸν ἐνίκα δῖος Ὀδυσσεὺς παντοίοισι δόλοισι, πατὴρ τεός, εἰ ἐτεόν γε κείνου ἔκγονός ἐσσι· σέβας μʼ ἔχει εἰσορόωντα. ἦ τοι γὰρ μῦθοί γε ἐοικότες, οὐδέ κε φαίης
 that he might appease the dread wrath of Athena,—fool! nor knew he this, that with her was to be no hearkening; for the mind of the gods that are forever is not quickly turned. So these two stood bandying harsh words; but the well-greaved Achaeans sprang up	ἄνδρα νεώτερον ὧδε ἐοικότα μυθήσασθαι. ἔνθʼ ἦ τοι ἧος μὲν ἐγὼ καὶ δῖος Ὀδυσσεὺς οὔτε ποτʼ εἰν ἀγορῇ δίχʼ ἐβάζομεν οὔτʼ ἐνὶ βουλῇ, ἀλλʼ ἕνα θυμὸν ἔχοντε νόῳ καὶ ἐπίφρονι βουλῇ φραζόμεθʼ Ἀργείοισιν ὅπως ὄχʼ ἄριστα γένοιτο.
 with a wondrous din, and two-fold plans found favour with them. That night we rested, each side pondering hard thoughts against the other, for Zeus was bringing upon us an evil doom, but in the morning some of us launched our ships upon the bright sea, and put on board our goods and the low-girdled women.	αὐτὰρ ἐπεὶ Πριάμοιο πόλιν διεπέρσαμεν αἰπήν, βῆμεν δʼ ἐν νήεσσι, θεὸς δʼ ἐκέδασσεν Ἀχαιούς, καὶ τότε δὴ Ζεὺς λυγρὸν ἐνὶ φρεσὶ μήδετο νόστον Ἀργείοις, ἐπεὶ οὔ τι νοήμονες οὐδὲ δίκαιοι πάντες ἔσαν· τῶ σφεων πολέες κακὸν οἶτον ἐπέσπον
Half, indeed, of the host held back and remained there with Agamemnon, son of Atreus, shepherd of the host, but half of us embarked and rowed away; and swiftly the ships sailed, for a god made smooth the cavernous sea. But when we came to Tenedos , we offered sacrifice to the gods,	μήνιος ἐξ ὀλοῆς γλαυκώπιδος ὀβριμοπάτρης. ἥ τʼ ἔριν Ἀτρεΐδῃσι μετʼ ἀμφοτέροισιν ἔθηκε. τὼ δὲ καλεσσαμένω ἀγορὴν ἐς πάντας Ἀχαιούς, μάψ, ἀτὰρ οὐ κατὰ κόσμον, ἐς ἠέλιον καταδύντα, οἱ ἦλθον οἴνῳ βεβαρηότες υἷες Ἀχαιῶν,
 being eager to reach our homes, howbeit Zeus did not yet purpose our return, stubborn god, who roused evil strife again a second time. Then some turned back their curved ships and departed, even the lord Odysseus, the wise and crafty-minded, with his company, once more showing favour to Agamemnon, son of Atreus;	μῦθον μυθείσθην, τοῦ εἵνεκα λαὸν ἄγειραν. ἔνθʼ ἤ τοι Μενέλαος ἀνώγει πάντας Ἀχαιοὺς νόστου μιμνήσκεσθαι ἐπʼ εὐρέα νῶτα θαλάσσης, οὐδʼ Ἀγαμέμνονι πάμπαν ἑήνδανε· βούλετο γάρ ῥα λαὸν ἐρυκακέειν ῥέξαι θʼ ἱερὰς ἑκατόμβας,
but I with the full company of ships that followed me fled on, for I knew that the god was devising evil. And the warlike son of Tydeus fled and urged on his men; and late upon our track came fair-haired Menelaus, and overtook us in Lesbos , as we were debating the long voyage,	ὡς τὸν Ἀθηναίης δεινὸν χόλον ἐξακέσαιτο, νήπιος, οὐδὲ τὸ ᾔδη, ὃ οὐ πείσεσθαι ἔμελλεν· οὐ γάρ τʼ αἶψα θεῶν τρέπεται νόος αἰὲν ἐόντων. ὣς τὼ μὲν χαλεποῖσιν ἀμειβομένω ἐπέεσσιν ἕστασαν· οἱ δʼ ἀνόρουσαν ἐυκνήμιδες Ἀχαιοὶ
whether we should sail to sea-ward of rugged Chios , toward the isle Psyria, keeping Chios itself on our left, or to land-ward of Chios past windy Mimas. So we asked the god to shew us a sign, and he shewed it us, and bade us cleave through the midst of the sea to Euboea ,	ἠχῇ θεσπεσίῃ, δίχα δέ σφισιν ἥνδανε βουλή. νύκτα μὲν ἀέσαμεν χαλεπὰ φρεσὶν ὁρμαίνοντες ἀλλήλοις· ἐπὶ γὰρ Ζεὺς ἤρτυε πῆμα κακοῖο· ἠῶθεν δʼ οἱ μὲν νέας ἕλκομεν εἰς ἅλα δῖαν κτήματά τʼ ἐντιθέμεσθα βαθυζώνους τε γυναῖκας.
 that we might the soonest escape from misery. And a shrill wind sprang up to blow, and the ships ran swiftly over the teeming ways, and at night put in to Geraestus. There on the altar of Poseidon we laid many thighs of bulls, thankful to have traversed the great sea.	ἡμίσεες δʼ ἄρα λαοὶ ἐρητύοντο μένοντες αὖθι παρʼ Ἀτρεΐδῃ Ἀγαμέμνονι, ποιμένι λαῶν· ἡμίσεες δʼ ἀναβάντες ἐλαύνομεν· αἱ δὲ μάλʼ ὦκα ἔπλεον, ἐστόρεσεν δὲ θεὸς μεγακήτεα πόντον. ἐς Τένεδον δʼ ἐλθόντες ἐρέξαμεν ἱρὰ θεοῖσιν,
It was the fourth day when in Argos the company of Diomedes, son of Tydeus, tamer of horses, stayed their shapely ships; but I held on toward Pylos , and the wind was not once quenched from the time when the god first sent it forth to blow. “Thus I came, dear child, without tidings, nor know I aught	οἴκαδε ἱέμενοι· Ζεὺς δʼ οὔ πω μήδετο νόστον, σχέτλιος, ὅς ῥʼ ἔριν ὦρσε κακὴν ἔπι δεύτερον αὖτις. οἱ μὲν ἀποστρέψαντες ἔβαν νέας ἀμφιελίσσας ἀμφʼ Ὀδυσῆα ἄνακτα δαΐφρονα, ποικιλομήτην, αὖτις ἐπʼ Ἀτρεΐδῃ Ἀγαμέμνονι ἦρα φέροντες·
 of those others, who of the Achaeans were saved, and who were lost. But what tidings I have heard as I abide in our halls thou shalt hear, as is right, nor will I hide it from thee. Safely, they say, came the Myrmidons that rage with the spear, whom the famous son of great-hearted Achilles led;	αὐτὰρ ἐγὼ σὺν νηυσὶν ἀολλέσιν, αἵ μοι ἕποντο, φεῦγον, ἐπεὶ γίγνωσκον, ὃ δὴ κακὰ μήδετο δαίμων. φεῦγε δὲ Τυδέος υἱὸς ἀρήιος, ὦρσε δʼ ἑταίρους. ὀψὲ δὲ δὴ μετὰ νῶι κίε ξανθὸς Μενέλαος, ἐν Λέσβῳ δʼ ἔκιχεν δολιχὸν πλόον ὁρμαίνοντας,
and safely Philoctetes, the glorious son of Poias. All his company, too, did Idomeneus bring to Crete , all who escaped the war, and the sea robbed him of none. But of the son of Atreus you have yourselves heard, far off though you are, how he came, and how Aegisthus devised for him a woeful doom.	ἢ καθύπερθε Χίοιο νεοίμεθα παιπαλοέσσης, νήσου ἔπι Ψυρίης, αὐτὴν ἐπʼ ἀριστέρʼ ἔχοντες, ἦ ὑπένερθε Χίοιο, παρʼ ἠνεμόεντα Μίμαντα. ᾐτέομεν δὲ θεὸν φῆναι τέρας· αὐτὰρ ὅ γʼ ἡμῖν δεῖξε, καὶ ἠνώγει πέλαγος μέσον εἰς Εὔβοιαν
 Yet verily he paid the reckoning therefor in terrible wise, so good a thing is it that a son be left behind a man at his death, since that son took vengeance on his father's slayer, the guileful Aegisthus, for that he slew his glorious father. Thou, too, friend, for I see thou art a comely man and tall,	τέμνειν, ὄφρα τάχιστα ὑπὲκ κακότητα φύγοιμεν. ὦρτο δʼ ἐπὶ λιγὺς οὖρος ἀήμεναι· αἱ δὲ μάλʼ ὦκα ἰχθυόεντα κέλευθα διέδραμον, ἐς δὲ Γεραιστὸν ἐννύχιαι κατάγοντο· Ποσειδάωνι δὲ ταύρων πόλλʼ ἐπὶ μῆρʼ ἔθεμεν, πέλαγος μέγα μετρήσαντες.
be thou valiant, that many an one among men yet to be born may praise thee.” Then wise Telemachus answered him: “Nestor, son of Neleus, great glory of the Achaeans, yea verily that son took vengeance, and the Achaeans shall spread his fame abroad, that men who are yet to be may hear thereof.	τέτρατον ἦμαρ ἔην, ὅτʼ ἐν Ἄργεϊ νῆας ἐίσας Τυδεΐδεω ἕταροι Διομήδεος ἱπποδάμοιο ἵστασαν· αὐτὰρ ἐγώ γε Πύλονδʼ ἔχον, οὐδέ ποτʼ ἔσβη οὖρος, ἐπεὶ δὴ πρῶτα θεὸς προέηκεν ἀῆναι. ὣς ἦλθον, φίλε τέκνον, ἀπευθής, οὐδέ τι οἶδα
O that the gods would clothe me with such strength, that I might take vengeance on the wooers for their grievous sin, who in wantonness devise mischief against me. But lo, the gods have spun for me no such happiness, for me or for my father; and now I must in any case endure.”	κείνων, οἵ τʼ ἐσάωθεν Ἀχαιῶν οἵ τʼ ἀπόλοντο. ὅσσα δʼ ἐνὶ μεγάροισι καθήμενος ἡμετέροισι πεύθομαι, ἣ θέμις ἐστί, δαήσεαι, οὐδέ σε κεύσω. εὖ μὲν Μυρμιδόνας φάσʼ ἐλθέμεν ἐγχεσιμώρους, οὓς ἄγʼ Ἀχιλλῆος μεγαθύμου φαίδιμος υἱός,
Then the horseman, Nestor of Gerenia , answered him: “Friend, since thou calledst this to my mind and didst speak of it, they say that many wooers for the hand of thy mother devise evils in thy halls in thy despite. Tell me, art thou willingly thus oppressed, or do the people	εὖ δὲ Φιλοκτήτην, Ποιάντιον ἀγλαὸν υἱόν. πάντας δʼ Ἰδομενεὺς Κρήτην εἰσήγαγʼ ἑταίρους, οἳ φύγον ἐκ πολέμου, πόντος δέ οἱ οὔ τινʼ ἀπηύρα. Ἀτρεΐδην δὲ καὶ αὐτοὶ ἀκούετε, νόσφιν ἐόντες, ὥς τʼ ἦλθʼ, ὥς τʼ Αἴγισθος ἐμήσατο λυγρὸν ὄλεθρον.
 throughout the land hate thee, following the voice of a god? Who knows but Odysseus may some day come and take vengeance on them for their violent deeds,—he alone, it may be, or even all the host of the Achaeans? Ah, would that flashing-eyed Athena might choose to love thee even as then she cared exceedingly for glorious Odysseus	ἀλλʼ ἦ τοι κεῖνος μὲν ἐπισμυγερῶς ἀπέτισεν· ὡς ἀγαθὸν καὶ παῖδα καταφθιμένοιο λιπέσθαι ἀνδρός, ἐπεὶ καὶ κεῖνος ἐτίσατο πατροφονῆα, Αἴγισθον δολόμητιν, ὅ οἱ πατέρα κλυτὸν ἔκτα. καὶ σὺ φίλος, μάλα γάρ σʼ ὁρόω καλόν τε μέγαν τε,
in the land of the Trojans, where we Achaeans suffered woes. For never yet have I seen the gods so manifestly shewing love, as Pallas Athena did to him, standing manifest by his side. If she would be pleased to love thee in such wise and would care for thee at heart, then would many a one of them utterly forget marriage.”	ἄλκιμος ἔσσʼ, ἵνα τίς σε καὶ ὀψιγόνων ἐὺ εἴπῃ. τὸν δʼ αὖ Τηλέμαχος πεπνυμένος ἀντίον ηὔδα· ὦ Νέστορ Νηληϊάδη, μέγα κῦδος Ἀχαιῶν, καὶ λίην κεῖνος μὲν ἐτίσατο, καί οἱ Ἀχαιοὶ οἴσουσι κλέος εὐρὺ καὶ ἐσσομένοισι πυθέσθαι·
Then wise Telemachus answered him: “Old man, in no wise do I deem that this word will be brought to pass. Too great is what thou sayest; amazement holds me. No hope have I that this will come to pass, no, not though the gods should so will it.” Then the goddess, flashing-eyed Athena, spoke to him, and said:	αἲ γὰρ ἐμοὶ τοσσήνδε θεοὶ δύναμιν περιθεῖεν, τίσασθαι μνηστῆρας ὑπερβασίης ἀλεγεινῆς, οἵ τέ μοι ὑβρίζοντες ἀτάσθαλα μηχανόωνται. ἀλλʼ οὔ μοι τοιοῦτον ἐπέκλωσαν θεοὶ ὄλβον, πατρί τʼ ἐμῷ καὶ ἐμοί· νῦν δὲ χρὴ τετλάμεν ἔμπης.
 “Telemachus, what a word has escaped the barrier of thy teeth! Easily might a god who willed it bring a man safe home, even from afar. But for myself, I had rather endure many grievous toils ere I reached home and saw the day of my returning, than after my return be slain at my hearth, as Agamemnon	τὸν δʼ ἠμείβετʼ ἔπειτα Γερήνιος ἱππότα Νέστωρ· ὦ φίλʼ, ἐπεὶ δὴ ταῦτά μʼ ἀνέμνησας καὶ ἔειπες, φασὶ μνηστῆρας σῆς μητέρος εἵνεκα πολλοὺς ἐν μεγάροις ἀέκητι σέθεν κακὰ μηχανάασθαι· εἰπέ μοι, ἠὲ ἑκὼν ὑποδάμνασαι, ἦ σέ γε λαοὶ
was slain by the guile of Aegisthus and of his own wife. But of a truth death that is common to all the gods themselves cannot ward from a man they love, when the fell fate of grievous death shall strike him down.” Then wise Telemachus answered her:	ἐχθαίρουσʼ ἀνὰ δῆμον, ἐπισπόμενοι θεοῦ ὀμφῇ. τίς δʼ οἶδʼ εἴ κέ ποτέ σφι βίας ἀποτίσεται ἐλθών, ἢ ὅ γε μοῦνος ἐὼν ἢ καὶ σύμπαντες Ἀχαιοί; εἰ γάρ σʼ ὣς ἐθέλοι φιλέειν γλαυκῶπις Ἀθήνη, ὡς τότʼ Ὀδυσσῆος περικήδετο κυδαλίμοιο
 “Mentor, no longer let us tell of these things despite our grief. For him no return can ever more be brought to pass; nay, ere this the immortals have devised for him death and black fate. But now I would make enquiry and ask Nestor regarding another matter, since beyond all others he knows judgments and wisdom;	δήμῳ ἔνι Τρώων, ὅθι πάσχομεν ἄλγεʼ Ἀχαιοί— οὐ γάρ πω ἴδον ὧδε θεοὺς ἀναφανδὰ φιλεῦντας, ὡς κείνῳ ἀναφανδὰ παρίστατο Παλλὰς Ἀθήνη— εἴ σʼ οὕτως ἐθέλοι φιλέειν κήδοιτό τε θυμῷ, τῶ κέν τις κείνων γε καὶ ἐκλελάθοιτο γάμοιο.
 for thrice, men say, has he been king for a generation of men, and like unto an immortal he seems to me to look upon. Nestor, son of Neleus, do thou tell me truly: how was the son of Atreus, wide-ruling Agamemnon, slain? Where was Menelaus? What death did	τὸν δʼ αὖ Τηλέμαχος πεπνυμένος ἀντίον ηὔδα· ὦ γέρον, οὔ πω τοῦτο ἔπος τελέεσθαι ὀίω· λίην γὰρ μέγα εἶπες· ἄγη μʼ ἔχει. οὐκ ἂν ἐμοί γε ἐλπομένῳ τὰ γένοιτʼ, οὐδʼ εἰ θεοὶ ὣς ἐθέλοιεν. τὸν δʼ αὖτε προσέειπε θεά, γλαυκῶπις Ἀθήνη·
guileful Aegisthus plan for the king, since he slew a man mightier far than himself? Was Menelaus not in Achaean Argos, but wandering elsewhere among men, so that Aegisthus took heart and did the murderous deed?” Then the horseman, Nestor of Gerenia , answered him: “Then verily, my child, will I tell thee all the truth.	Τηλέμαχε, ποῖόν σε ἔπος φύγεν ἕρκος ὀδόντων. ῥεῖα θεός γʼ ἐθέλων καὶ τηλόθεν ἄνδρα σαώσαι. βουλοίμην δʼ ἂν ἐγώ γε καὶ ἄλγεα πολλὰ μογήσας οἴκαδέ τʼ ἐλθέμεναι καὶ νόστιμον ἦμαρ ἰδέσθαι, ἢ ἐλθὼν ἀπολέσθαι ἐφέστιος, ὡς Ἀγαμέμνων
Lo, of thine own self thou dost guess how this matter would have fallen out, if the son of Atreus, fair-haired Menelaus, on his return from Troy had found Aegisthus in his halls alive. Then for him not even in death would they have piled the up-piled earth, but the dogs and birds would have torn him	ὤλεθʼ ὑπʼ Αἰγίσθοιο δόλῳ καὶ ἧς ἀλόχοιο. ἀλλʼ ἦ τοι θάνατον μὲν ὁμοίιον οὐδὲ θεοί περ καὶ φίλῳ ἀνδρὶ δύνανται ἀλαλκέμεν, ὁππότε κεν δὴ μοῖρʼ ὀλοὴ καθέλῃσι τανηλεγέος θανάτοιο. τὴν δʼ αὖ Τηλέμαχος πεπνυμένος ἀντίον ηὔδα·
as he lay on the plain far from the city, nor would any of the Achaean women have bewailed him; for monstrous was the deed he devised. We on our part abode there in Troy fulfilling our many toils; but he, at ease in a nook of horse-pasturing Argos , ever sought to beguile with words the wife of Agamemnon.	Μέντορ, μηκέτι ταῦτα λεγώμεθα κηδόμενοί περ· κείνῳ δʼ οὐκέτι νόστος ἐτήτυμος, ἀλλά οἱ ἤδη φράσσαντʼ ἀθάνατοι θάνατον καὶ κῆρα μέλαιναν. νῦν δʼ ἐθέλω ἔπος ἄλλο μεταλλῆσαι καὶ ἐρέσθαι Νέστορʼ, ἐπεὶ περὶ οἶδε δίκας ἠδὲ φρόνιν ἄλλων·
Now at the first she put from her the unseemly deed, the beautiful Clytemnestra, for she had an understanding heart; and with her was furthermore a minstrel whom the son of Atreus straitly charged, when he set forth for the land of Troy , to guard his wife. But when at length the doom of the gods bound her that she should be overcome,	τρὶς γὰρ δή μίν φασιν ἀνάξασθαι γένεʼ ἀνδρῶν· ὥς τέ μοι ἀθάνατος ἰνδάλλεται εἰσοράασθαι. ὦ Νέστορ Νηληϊάδη, σὺ δʼ ἀληθὲς ἐνίσπες· πῶς ἔθανʼ Ἀτρεΐδης εὐρὺ κρείων Ἀγαμέμνων; ποῦ Μενέλαος ἔην; τίνα δʼ αὐτῷ μήσατʼ ὄλεθρον
 then verily Aegisthus took the minstrel to a desert isle and left him to be the prey and spoil of birds; and her, willing as he was willing, he led to his own house. And many thigh-pieces he burned upon the holy altars of the gods, and many offerings he hung up, woven stuffs and gold,	Αἴγισθος δολόμητις, ἐπεὶ κτάνε πολλὸν ἀρείω; ἦ οὐκ Ἄργεος ἦεν Ἀχαιικοῦ, ἀλλά πῃ ἄλλῃ πλάζετʼ ἐπʼ ἀνθρώπους, ὁ δὲ θαρσήσας κατέπεφνε; τὸν δʼ ἠμείβετʼ ἔπειτα Γερήνιος ἱππότα Νέστωρ· τοιγὰρ ἐγώ τοι, τέκνον, ἀληθέα πάντʼ ἀγορεύσω.
since he had accomplished a mighty deed beyond all his heart had hoped. “Now we were sailing together on our way from Troy , the son of Atreus and I, in all friendship; but when we came to holy Sunium, the cape of Athens , there Phoebus Apollo	ἦ τοι μὲν τάδε καὐτὸς ὀίεαι, ὥς κεν ἐτύχθη, εἰ ζωόν γʼ Αἴγισθον ἐνὶ μεγάροισιν ἔτετμεν Ἀτρεΐδης Τροίηθεν ἰών, ξανθὸς Μενέλαος· τῶ κέ οἱ οὐδὲ θανόντι χυτὴν ἐπὶ γαῖαν ἔχευαν, ἀλλʼ ἄρα τόν γε κύνες τε καὶ οἰωνοὶ κατέδαψαν
assailed with his gentle shafts and slew the helmsman of Menelaus, as he held in his hands the steering-oar of the speeding ship, even Phrontis, son of Onetor, who excelled the tribes of men in piloting a ship when the storm winds blow strong. So Menelaus tarried there, though eager for his journey,	κείμενον ἐν πεδίῳ ἑκὰς ἄστεος, οὐδέ κέ τίς μιν κλαῦσεν Ἀχαιιάδων· μάλα γὰρ μέγα μήσατο ἔργον. ἡμεῖς μὲν γὰρ κεῖθι πολέας τελέοντες ἀέθλους ἥμεθʼ· ὁ δʼ εὔκηλος μυχῷ Ἄργεος ἱπποβότοιο πόλλʼ Ἀγαμεμνονέην ἄλοχον θέλγεσκʼ ἐπέεσσιν.
 that he might bury his comrade and over him pay funeral rites. But when he in his turn, as he passed over the wine-dark sea in the hollow ships, reached in swift course the steep height of Malea, then verily Zeus, whose voice is borne afar, planned for him a hateful path and poured upon him the blasts of shrill winds,	ἡ δʼ ἦ τοι τὸ πρὶν μὲν ἀναίνετο ἔργον ἀεικὲς δῖα Κλυταιμνήστρη· φρεσὶ γὰρ κέχρητʼ ἀγαθῇσι· πὰρ δʼ ἄρʼ ἔην καὶ ἀοιδὸς ἀνήρ, ᾧ πόλλʼ ἐπέτελλεν Ἀτρεΐδης Τροίηνδε κιὼν εἴρυσθαι ἄκοιτιν. ἀλλʼ ὅτε δή μιν μοῖρα θεῶν ἐπέδησε δαμῆναι,
and the waves were swollen to huge size, like unto mountains. Then, parting his ships in twain, he brought some to Crete , where the Cydonians dwelt about the streams of Iardanus. Now there is a smooth cliff, sheer towards the sea, on the border of Gortyn in the misty deep,	δὴ τότε τὸν μὲν ἀοιδὸν ἄγων ἐς νῆσον ἐρήμην κάλλιπεν οἰωνοῖσιν ἕλωρ καὶ κύρμα γενέσθαι, τὴν δʼ ἐθέλων ἐθέλουσαν ἀνήγαγεν ὅνδε δόμονδε. πολλὰ δὲ μηρίʼ ἔκηε θεῶν ἱεροῖς ἐπὶ βωμοῖς, πολλὰ δʼ ἀγάλματʼ ἀνῆψεν, ὑφάσματά τε χρυσόν τε,
where the Southwest Wind drives the great wave against the headland on the left toward Phaestus , and a little rock holds back a great wave. Thither came some of his ships, and the men with much ado escaped destruction, howbeit the ships the waves dashed to pieces against the reef. But the five other dark-prowed ships	ἐκτελέσας μέγα ἔργον, ὃ οὔ ποτε ἔλπετο θυμῷ. ἡμεῖς μὲν γὰρ ἅμα πλέομεν Τροίηθεν ἰόντες, Ἀτρεΐδης καὶ ἐγώ, φίλα εἰδότες ἀλλήλοισιν· ἀλλʼ ὅτε Σούνιον ἱρὸν ἀφικόμεθʼ, ἄκρον Ἀθηνέων, ἔνθα κυβερνήτην Μενελάου Φοῖβος Ἀπόλλων
the wind, as it bore them, and the wave brought to Egypt . So he was wandering there with his ships among men of strange speech, gathering much livelihood and gold; but meanwhile Aegisthus devised this woeful work at home.	οἷς ἀγανοῖς βελέεσσιν ἐποιχόμενος κατέπεφνε, πηδάλιον μετὰ χερσὶ θεούσης νηὸς ἔχοντα, Φρόντιν Ὀνητορίδην, ὃς ἐκαίνυτο φῦλʼ ἀνθρώπων νῆα κυβερνῆσαι, ὁπότε σπέρχοιεν ἄελλαι. ὣς ὁ μὲν ἔνθα κατέσχετʼ, ἐπειγόμενός περ ὁδοῖο,
Seven years he reigned over Mycenae , rich in gold, after slaying the son of Atreus, and the people were subdued under him; but in the eighth came as his bane the goodly Orestes back from Athens , and slew his father's murderer,	ὄφρʼ ἕταρον θάπτοι καὶ ἐπὶ κτέρεα κτερίσειεν. ἀλλʼ ὅτε δὴ καὶ κεῖνος ἰὼν ἐπὶ οἴνοπα πόντον ἐν νηυσὶ γλαφυρῇσι Μαλειάων ὄρος αἰπὺ ἷξε θέων, τότε δὴ στυγερὴν ὁδὸν εὐρύοπα Ζεὺς ἐφράσατο, λιγέων δʼ ἀνέμων ἐπʼ ἀυτμένα χεῦε,
the guileful Aegisthus, for that he had slain his glorious father. Now when he had slain him, he made a funeral feast for the Argives over his hateful mother and the craven Aegisthus; and on the self-same day there came to him Menelaus, good at the war-cry, bringing much treasure, even all the burden that his ships could bear. “So do not thou, my friend, wander long far from home, leaving thy wealth behind thee and men in thy house	κύματά τε τροφέοντο πελώρια, ἶσα ὄρεσσιν. ἔνθα διατμήξας τὰς μὲν Κρήτῃ ἐπέλασσεν, ἧχι Κύδωνες ἔναιον Ἰαρδάνου ἀμφὶ ῥέεθρα. ἔστι δέ τις λισσὴ αἰπεῖά τε εἰς ἅλα πέτρη ἐσχατιῇ Γόρτυνος ἐν ἠεροειδέι πόντῳ·
 so insolent, lest they divide and devour all thy wealth, and thou shalt have gone on a fruitless journey. But to Menelaus I bid and command thee to go, for he has but lately come from a strange land, from a folk whence no one would hope in his heart	ἔνθα Νότος μέγα κῦμα ποτὶ σκαιὸν ῥίον ὠθεῖ, ἐς Φαιστόν, μικρὸς δὲ λίθος μέγα κῦμʼ ἀποέργει. αἱ μὲν ἄρʼ ἔνθʼ ἦλθον, σπουδῇ δʼ ἤλυξαν ὄλεθρον ἄνδρες, ἀτὰρ νῆάς γε ποτὶ σπιλάδεσσιν ἔαξαν κύματʼ· ἀτὰρ τὰς πέντε νέας κυανοπρῳρείους
 to return, whom the storms had once driven astray into a sea so great, whence the very birds do not fare in the space of a year, so great is it and terrible. But now go thy way with thy ship and thy comrades, or, if thou wilt go by land, here are chariot and horses at hand for thee,	Αἰγύπτῳ ἐπέλασσε φέρων ἄνεμός τε καὶ ὕδωρ. ὣς ὁ μὲν ἔνθα πολὺν βίοτον καὶ χρυσὸν ἀγείρων ἠλᾶτο ξὺν νηυσὶ κατʼ ἀλλοθρόους ἀνθρώπους· τόφρα δὲ ταῦτʼ Αἴγισθος ἐμήσατο οἴκοθι λυγρά.
and here at thy service are my sons, who will be thy guides to goodly Lacedaemon , where lives fair-haired Menelaus. And do thou beseech him thyself that he may tell thee the very truth. A lie will be not utter, for he is wise indeed.” So he spoke, and the sun set, and darkness came on.	ἑπτάετες δʼ ἤνασσε πολυχρύσοιο Μυκήνης, κτείνας Ἀτρεΐδην, δέδμητο δὲ λαὸς ὑπʼ αὐτῷ. τῷ δέ οἱ ὀγδοάτῳ κακὸν ἤλυθε δῖος Ὀρέστης ἂψ ἀπʼ Ἀθηνάων, κατὰ δʼ ἔκτανε πατροφονῆα, Αἴγισθον δολόμητιν, ὅ οἱ πατέρα κλυτὸν ἔκτα. ἦ τοι ὁ τὸν κτείνας δαίνυ τάφον Ἀργείοισιν
 Then among them spoke the goddess, flashing-eyed Athena: “Old man, of a truth thou hast told this tale aright. But come, cut out the tongues of the victims and mix the wine, that when we have poured libations to Poseidon and the other immortals, we may bethink us of sleep; for it is the time thereto.	μητρός τε στυγερῆς καὶ ἀνάλκιδος Αἰγίσθοιο· αὐτῆμαρ δέ οἱ ἦλθε βοὴν ἀγαθὸς Μενέλαος πολλὰ κτήματʼ ἄγων, ὅσα οἱ νέες ἄχθος ἄειραν. καὶ σύ, φίλος, μὴ δηθὰ δόμων ἄπο τῆλʼ ἀλάλησο, κτήματά τε προλιπὼν ἄνδρας τʼ ἐν σοῖσι δόμοισιν
Even now has the light gone down beneath the darkness, and it is not fitting to sit long at the feast of the gods, but to go our way.” So spoke the daughter of Zeus, and they hearkenened to her voice. Heralds poured water over their hands, and youths filled the bowls brim full of drink,	οὕτω ὑπερφιάλους, μή τοι κατὰ πάντα φάγωσιν κτήματα δασσάμενοι, σὺ δὲ τηϋσίην ὁδὸν ἔλθῃς. ἀλλʼ ἐς μὲν Μενέλαον ἐγὼ κέλομαι καὶ ἄνωγα ἐλθεῖν· κεῖνος γὰρ νέον ἄλλοθεν εἰλήλουθεν, ἐκ τῶν ἀνθρώπων, ὅθεν οὐκ ἔλποιτό γε θυμῷ
 and served out to all, pouring first drops for libation into the cups. Then they cast the tongues upon the fire, and, rising up, poured libations upon them. But when they had poured libations and had drunk to their heart's content, then verily Athena and godlike Telemachus were both fain to return to the hollow ship;	ἐλθέμεν, ὅν τινα πρῶτον ἀποσφήλωσιν ἄελλαι ἐς πέλαγος μέγα τοῖον, ὅθεν τέ περ οὐδʼ οἰωνοὶ αὐτόετες οἰχνεῦσιν, ἐπεὶ μέγα τε δεινόν τε. ἀλλʼ ἴθι νῦν σὺν νηί τε σῇ καὶ σοῖς ἑτάροισιν· εἰ δʼ ἐθέλεις πεζός, πάρα τοι δίφρος τε καὶ ἵπποι,
but Nestor on his part sought to stay them, and he spoke to them, saying: “This may Zeus forbid, and the other immortal gods, that ye should go from my house to your swift ship as from one utterly without raiment and poor, who has not cloaks and blankets in plenty in his house,	πὰρ δέ τοι υἷες ἐμοί, οἵ τοι πομπῆες ἔσονται ἐς Λακεδαίμονα δῖαν, ὅθι ξανθὸς Μενέλαος. λίσσεσθαι δέ μιν αὐτός, ἵνα νημερτὲς ἐνίσπῃ· ψεῦδος δʼ οὐκ ἐρέει· μάλα γὰρ πεπνυμένος ἐστίν. ὣς ἔφατʼ, ἠέλιος δʼ ἄρʼ ἔδυ καὶ ἐπὶ κνέφας ἦλθε.
 whereon both he and his guests may sleep softly. Nay, in my house there are cloaks and fair blankets. Never surely shall the dear son of this man Odysseus lie down upon the deck of a ship, while I yet live and children after me are left in my halls	τοῖσι δὲ καὶ μετέειπε θεά, γλαυκῶπις Ἀθήνη· ὦ γέρον, ἦ τοι ταῦτα κατὰ μοῖραν κατέλεξας· ἀλλʼ ἄγε τάμνετε μὲν γλώσσας, κεράασθε δὲ οἶνον, ὄφρα Ποσειδάωνι καὶ ἄλλοις ἀθανάτοισιν σπείσαντες κοίτοιο μεδώμεθα· τοῖο γὰρ ὥρη.
to entertain strangers, even whosoever shall come to my house.” Then the goddess, flashing-eyed Athena, answered him: “Well indeed hast thou spoken in this, old friend, and it were fitting for Telemachus to hearken to thee, since it is far better thus. But while he shall now follow with thee, that he may sleep	ἤδη γὰρ φάος οἴχεθʼ ὑπὸ ζόφον, οὐδὲ ἔοικεν· δηθὰ θεῶν ἐν δαιτὶ θαασσέμεν, ἀλλὰ νέεσθαι. ἦ ῥα Διὸς θυγάτηρ, οἱ δʼ ἔκλυον αὐδησάσης. τοῖσι δὲ κήρυκες μὲν ὕδωρ ἐπὶ χεῖρας ἔχευαν, κοῦροι δὲ κρητῆρας ἐπεστέψαντο ποτοῖο,
 in thy halls, I for my part will go to the black ship, that I may hearten my comrades and tell them all. For alone among them I declare that I am an older man; the others are younger who follow in friendship, all of them of like age with great-hearted Telemachus.	νώμησαν δʼ ἄρα πᾶσιν ἐπαρξάμενοι δεπάεσσι· γλώσσας δʼ ἐν πυρὶ βάλλον, ἀνιστάμενοι δʼ ἐπέλειβον. αὐτὰρ ἐπεὶ σπεῖσάν τʼ ἔπιον θʼ, ὅσον ἤθελε θυμός, δὴ τότʼ Ἀθηναίη καὶ Τηλέμαχος θεοειδὴς ἄμφω ἱέσθην κοίλην ἐπὶ νῆα νέεσθαι.
 There will I lay me down by the hollow black ship this night, but in the morning I will go to the great-hearted Cauconians, where a debt is owing to me, in no wise new or small. But do thou send this man on his way with a chariot and with thy son, since he has come to thy house, and give him horses,	Νέστωρ δʼ αὖ κατέρυκε καθαπτόμενος ἐπέεσσιν· Ζεὺς τό γʼ ἀλεξήσειε καὶ ἀθάνατοι θεοὶ ἄλλοι, ὡς ὑμεῖς παρʼ ἐμεῖο θοὴν ἐπὶ νῆα κίοιτε ὥς τέ τευ ἦ παρὰ πάμπαν ἀνείμονος ἠδὲ πενιχροῦ, ᾧ οὔ τι χλαῖναι καὶ ῥήγεα πόλλʼ ἐνὶ οἴκῳ,
the fleetest thou host in running and the best in strength.” So spoke the goddess, flashing-eyed Athena, and she departed in the likeness of a sea-eagle; and amazement fell upon all at the sight, and the old man marvelled, when his eyes beheld it. And he grasped the hand of Telemachus, and spoke, and addressed him:	οὔτʼ αὐτῷ μαλακῶς οὔτε ξείνοισιν ἐνεύδειν. αὐτὰρ ἐμοὶ πάρα μὲν χλαῖναι καὶ ῥήγεα καλά. οὔ θην δὴ τοῦδʼ ἀνδρὸς Ὀδυσσῆος φίλος υἱὸς νηὸς ἐπʼ ἰκριόφιν καταλέξεται, ὄφρʼ ἂν ἐγώ γε ζώω, ἔπειτα δὲ παῖδες ἐνὶ μεγάροισι λίπωνται,
“Friend, in no wise do I think that thou wilt prove a base man or a craven, if verily when thou art so young the gods follow thee to be thy guides. For truly this is none other of those that have their dwellings on Olympus but the daughter of Zeus, Tritogeneia, the maid most glorious, she that honored also thy noble father among the Argives.	ξείνους ξεινίζειν, ὅς τίς κʼ ἐμὰ δώμαθʼ ἵκηται. τὸν δʼ αὖτε προσέειπε θεά, γλαυκῶπις Ἀθήνη· εὖ δὴ ταῦτά γʼ ἔφησθα, γέρον φίλε· σοὶ δὲ ἔοικεν Τηλέμαχον πείθεσθαι, ἐπεὶ πολὺ κάλλιον οὕτως. ἀλλʼ οὗτος μὲν νῦν σοὶ ἅμʼ ἕψεται, ὄφρα κεν εὕδῃ
Nay, O Queen, be gracious, and grant to me fair renown, to me and to my sons and to my revered wife; and to thee in return will I sacrifice a sleek heifer, broad of brow, unbroken, which no man hath yet led beneath the yoke. Her will I sacrifice, and I will overlay her horns with gold.”	σοῖσιν ἐνὶ μεγάροισιν· ἐγὼ δʼ ἐπὶ νῆα μέλαιναν εἶμʼ, ἵνα θαρσύνω θʼ ἑτάρους εἴπω τε ἕκαστα. οἶος γὰρ μετὰ τοῖσι γεραίτερος εὔχομαι εἶναι· οἱ δʼ ἄλλοι φιλότητι νεώτεροι ἄνδρες ἕπονται, πάντες ὁμηλικίη μεγαθύμου Τηλεμάχοιο.
So he spoke in prayer, and Pallas Athena heard him. Then the horseman, Nestor of Gerenia , led them, his sons and the husbands of his daughters, to his beautiful palace. And when they reached the glorious palace of the king, they sat down in rows on the chairs and high seats;	ἔνθα κε λεξαίμην κοίλῃ παρὰ νηὶ μελαίνῃ νῦν· ἀτὰρ ἠῶθεν μετὰ Καύκωνας μεγαθύμους εἶμʼ ἔνθα χρεῖός μοι ὀφέλλεται, οὔ τι νέον γε οὐδʼ ὀλίγον. σὺ δὲ τοῦτον, ἐπεὶ τεὸν ἵκετο δῶμα, πέμψον σὺν δίφρῳ τε καὶ υἱέι· δὸς δέ οἱ ἵππους,
and on their coming the old man mixed for them a bowl of sweet wine, which now in the eleventh year the housewife opened, when she had loosed the string that held the lid. Thereof the old man bade mix a bowl, and earnestly he prayed, as he poured libations, to Athena, the daughter of Zeus who bears the aegis.	οἵ τοι ἐλαφρότατοι θείειν καὶ κάρτος ἄριστοι. ὣς ἄρα φωνήσασʼ ἀπέβη γλαυκῶπις Ἀθήνη φήνῃ εἰδομένη· θάμβος δʼ ἕλε πάντας ἰδόντας. θαύμαζεν δʼ ὁ γεραιός, ὅπως ἴδεν ὀφθαλμοῖς· Τηλεμάχου δʼ ἕλε χεῖρα, ἔπος τʼ ἔφατʼ ἔκ τʼ ὀνόμαζεν·
But when they had poured libations, and had drunk to their heart's content, they went, each to his home, to take their rest. But the horseman, Nestor of Gerenia , bade Telemachus, the dear son of divine Odysseus, to sleep there on a corded bedstead under the echoing portico,	ὦ φίλος, οὔ σε ἔολπα κακὸν καὶ ἄναλκιν ἔσεσθαι, εἰ δή τοι νέῳ ὧδε θεοὶ πομπῆες ἕπονται. οὐ μὲν γάρ τις ὅδʼ ἄλλος Ὀλύμπια δώματʼ ἐχόντων, ἀλλὰ Διὸς θυγάτηρ, κυδίστη Τριτογένεια, ἥ τοι καὶ πατέρʼ ἐσθλὸν ἐν Ἀργείοισιν ἐτίμα.
and by him Peisistratus, of the good ashen spear, a leader of men, who among his sons was still unwed in the palace. But he himself slept in the inmost chamber of the lofty house, and beside him lay the lady his wife, who had strewn the couch. Soon as early Dawn appeared, the rosy-fingered,	ἀλλὰ ἄνασσʼ ἵληθι, δίδωθι δέ μοι κλέος ἐσθλόν, αὐτῷ καὶ παίδεσσι καὶ αἰδοίῃ παρακοίτι· σοὶ δʼ αὖ ἐγὼ ῥέξω βοῦν ἦνιν εὐρυμέτωπον ἀδμήτην, ἣν οὔ πω ὑπὸ ζυγὸν ἤγαγεν ἀνήρ· τήν τοι ἐγὼ ῥέξω χρυσὸν κέρασιν περιχεύας.
up from his bed rose the horseman, Nestor of Gerenia , and went forth and sat down on the polished stones which were before his lofty doors, white and glistening as with oil. On these of old was wont to sit Neleus, the peer of the gods in counsel;	ὣς ἔφατʼ εὐχόμενος, τοῦ δʼ ἔκλυε Παλλὰς Ἀθήνη. τοῖσιν δʼ ἡγεμόνευε Γερήνιος ἱππότα Νέστωρ, υἱάσι καὶ γαμβροῖσιν, ἑὰ πρὸς δώματα καλά. ἀλλʼ ὅτε δώμαθʼ ἵκοντο ἀγακλυτὰ τοῖο ἄνακτος, ἑξείης ἕζοντο κατὰ κλισμούς τε θρόνους τε·
but he ere this had been stricken by fate and had gone to the house of Hades, and now there sat upon them in his turn Nestor of Gerenia , the warder of the Achaeans, holding a sceptre in his hands. About him his sons gathered in a throng as they came forth from their chambers, Echephron and Stratius and Perseus and Aretus and godlike Thrasymedes;	τοῖς δʼ ὁ γέρων ἐλθοῦσιν ἀνὰ κρητῆρα κέρασσεν οἴνου ἡδυπότοιο, τὸν ἑνδεκάτῳ ἐνιαυτῷ ὤιξεν ταμίη καὶ ἀπὸ κρήδεμνον ἔλυσε· τοῦ ὁ γέρων κρητῆρα κεράσσατο, πολλὰ δʼ Ἀθήνῃ εὔχετʼ ἀποσπένδων, κούρῃ Διὸς αἰγιόχοιο.
and to these thereafter came as the sixth the lord Peisistratus. And they led godlike Telemachus and made him sit beside them; and the horseman, Nestor of Gerenia , was first to speak among them: “Quickly, my dear children, fulfil my desire, that first of all the gods I may propitiate Athena,	αὐτὰρ ἐπεὶ σπεῖσάν τʼ ἔπιον θʼ, ὅσον ἤθελε θυμός, οἱ μὲν κακκείοντες ἔβαν οἶκόνδε ἕκαστος, τὸν δʼ αὐτοῦ κοίμησε Γερήνιος ἱππότα Νέστωρ, Τηλέμαχον, φίλον υἱὸν Ὀδυσσῆος θείοιο, τρητοῖς ἐν λεχέεσσιν ὑπʼ αἰθούσῃ ἐριδούπῳ,
 who came to me in manifest presence to the rich feast of the god. Come now, let one go to the plain for a heifer, that she may come speedily, and that the neatherd may drive her; and let one go to the black ship of great-hearted Telemachus and bring all his comrades, and let him leave two men only;	πὰρʼ δʼ ἄρʼ ἐυμμελίην Πεισίστρατον, ὄρχαμον ἀνδρῶν, ὅς οἱ ἔτʼ ἠίθεος παίδων ἦν ἐν μεγάροισιν· αὐτὸς δʼ αὖτε καθεῦδε μυχῷ δόμου ὑψηλοῖο, τῷ δʼ ἄλοχος δέσποινα λέχος πόρσυνε καὶ εὐνήν. ἦμος δʼ ἠριγένεια φάνη ῥοδοδάκτυλος Ἠώς,
and let one again bid the goldsmith Laerces come hither, that he may overlay the heifer's horns with gold. And do ye others abide here together; and bid the handmaids within to make ready a feast throughout our glorious halls, to fetch seats, and logs to set on either side of the altar, and to bring clear water.”	ὤρνυτʼ ἄρʼ ἐξ εὐνῆφι Γερήνιος ἱππότα Νέστωρ, ἐκ δʼ ἐλθὼν κατʼ ἄρʼ ἕζετʼ ἐπὶ ξεστοῖσι λίθοισιν, οἵ οἱ ἔσαν προπάροιθε θυράων ὑψηλάων, λευκοί, ἀποστίλβοντες ἀλείφατος· οἷς ἔπι μὲν πρὶν Νηλεὺς ἵζεσκεν, θεόφιν μήστωρ ἀτάλαντος·
 So he spoke, and they all set busily to work. The heifer came from the plain and from the swift, shapely ship came the comrades of great-hearted Telemachus; the smith came, bearing in his hands his tools of bronze, the implements of his craft, anvil and hammer and well-made tongs,	ἀλλʼ ὁ μὲν ἤδη κηρὶ δαμεὶς Ἄϊδόσδε βεβήκει, Νέστωρ αὖ τότʼ ἐφῖζε Γερήνιος, οὖρος Ἀχαιῶν, σκῆπτρον ἔχων. περὶ δʼ υἷες ἀολλέες ἠγερέθοντο ἐκ θαλάμων ἐλθόντες, Ἐχέφρων τε Στρατίος τε Περσεύς τʼ Ἄρητός τε καὶ ἀντίθεος Θρασυμήδης.
 wherewith he wrought the gold; and Athena came to accept the sacrifice. Then the old man, Nestor, the driver of chariots, gave gold, and the smith prepared it, and overlaid therewith the horns of the heifer, that the goddess might rejoice when she beheld the offering. And Stratius and goodly Echephron led the heifer by the horns,	τοῖσι δʼ ἔπειθʼ ἕκτος Πεισίστρατος ἤλυθεν ἥρως, πὰρ δʼ ἄρα Τηλέμαχον θεοείκελον εἷσαν ἄγοντες. τοῖσι δὲ μύθων ἦρχε Γερήνιος ἱππότα Νέστωρ· καρπαλίμως μοι, τέκνα φίλα, κρηήνατʼ ἐέλδωρ, ὄφρʼ ἦ τοι πρώτιστα θεῶν ἱλάσσομʼ Ἀθήνην,
 and Aretus came from the chamber, bringing them water for the hands in a basin embossed with flowers, and in the other hand he held barley grains in a basket; and Thrasymedes, steadfast in fight, stood by, holding in his hands a sharp axe, to fell the heifer; and Perseus held the bowl for the blood. Then the old man, Nestor, driver of chariots,	ἥ μοι ἐναργὴς ἦλθε θεοῦ ἐς δαῖτα θάλειαν. ἀλλʼ ἄγʼ ὁ μὲν πεδίονδʼ ἐπὶ βοῦν, ἴτω, ὄφρα τάχιστα ἔλθῃσιν, ἐλάσῃ δὲ βοῶν ἐπιβουκόλος ἀνήρ· εἷς δʼ ἐπὶ Τηλεμάχου μεγαθύμου νῆα μέλαιναν πάντας ἰὼν ἑτάρους ἀγέτω, λιπέτω δὲ δύʼ οἴους·
began the opening rite of hand-washing and sprinkling with barley grains, and earnestly he prayed to Athena, cutting off as first offering the hair from the head, and casting it into the fire. Now when they had prayed, and had strewn the barley grains, straightway the son of Nestor, Thrasymedes, high of heart, came near and dealt the blow; and the axe cut through the sinews	εἷς δʼ αὖ χρυσοχόον Λαέρκεα δεῦρο κελέσθω ἐλθεῖν, ὄφρα βοὸς χρυσὸν κέρασιν περιχεύῃ. οἱ δʼ ἄλλοι μένετʼ αὐτοῦ ἀολλέες, εἴπατε δʼ εἴσω δμῳῇσιν κατὰ δώματʼ ἀγακλυτὰ δαῖτα πένεσθαι, ἕδρας τε ξύλα τʼ ἀμφὶ καὶ ἀγλαὸν οἰσέμεν ὕδωρ.
 of the neck, and loosened the strength of the heifer. Then the women raised the sacred cry, the daughters and the sons' wives and the revered wife of Nestor, Eurydice, the eldest of the daughters of Clymenus, and the men raised the heifer's head from the broad-wayed earth and held it, and Peisistratus, leader of men, cut the throat.	ὣς ἔφαθʼ, οἱ δʼ ἄρα πάντες ἐποίπνυον. ἦλθε μὲν ἂρ βοῦς ἐκ πεδίου, ἦλθον δὲ θοῆς παρὰ νηὸς ἐίσης Τηλεμάχου ἕταροι μεγαλήτορος, ἦλθε δὲ χαλκεὺς ὅπλʼ ἐν χερσὶν ἔχων χαλκήια, πείρατα τέχνης, ἄκμονά τε σφῦραν τʼ ἐυποίητόν τε πυράγρην,
 And when the black blood had flowed from her and the life had left the bones, at once they cut up the body and straightway cut out the thigh-pieces all in due order, and covered them with a double layer of fat, and laid raw flesh upon them. Then the old man burned them on billets of wood, and poured over them sparkling wine,	οἷσίν τε χρυσὸν εἰργάζετο· ἦλθε δʼ Ἀθήνη ἱρῶν ἀντιόωσα. γέρων δʼ ἱππηλάτα Νέστωρ χρυσὸν ἔδωχʼ· ὁ δʼ ἔπειτα βοὸς κέρασιν περίχευεν ἀσκήσας, ἵνʼ ἄγαλμα θεὰ κεχάροιτο ἰδοῦσα. βοῦν δʼ ἀγέτην κεράων Στρατίος καὶ δῖος Ἐχέφρων.
and beside him the young men held in their hands the five-pronged forks. But when the thigh-pieces were wholly burned, and they had tasted the inner parts, they cut up the rest and spitted and roasted it, holding the pointed spits in their hands. Meanwhile the fair Polycaste,	χέρνιβα δέ σφʼ Ἄρητος ἐν ἀνθεμόεντι λέβητι ἤλυθεν ἐκ θαλάμοιο φέρων, ἑτέρῃ δʼ ἔχεν οὐλὰς ἐν κανέῳ πέλεκυν δὲ μενεπτόλεμος Θρασυμήδης ὀξὺν ἔχων ἐν χειρὶ παρίστατο βοῦν ἐπικόψων. Περσεὺς δʼ ἀμνίον εἶχε· γέρων δʼ ἱππηλάτα Νέστωρ
the youngest daughter of Nestor, son of Neleus, bathed Telemachus. And when she had bathed him and anointed him richly with oil, and had cast about him a fair cloak and a tunic, forth from the bath he came in form like unto the immortals; and he went and sat down by Nestor, the shepherd of the people.	χέρνιβά τʼ οὐλοχύτας τε κατήρχετο, πολλὰ δʼ Ἀθήνῃ εὔχετʼ ἀπαρχόμενος, κεφαλῆς τρίχας ἐν πυρὶ βάλλων. αὐτὰρ ἐπεί ῥʼ εὔξαντο καὶ οὐλοχύτας προβάλοντο, αὐτίκα Νέστορος υἱὸς ὑπέρθυμος Θρασυμήδης ἤλασεν ἄγχι στάς· πέλεκυς δʼ ἀπέκοψε τένοντας
Now when they had roasted the outer flesh and had drawn it off the spits, they sat down and feasted, and worthy men waited on them, pouring wine into golden cups. But when they had put from them the desire of food and drink, the horseman, Nestor of Gerenia , was first to speak, saying:	αὐχενίους, λῦσεν δὲ βοὸς μένος. αἱ δʼ ὀλόλυξαν θυγατέρες τε νυοί τε καὶ αἰδοίη παράκοιτις Νέστορος, Εὐρυδίκη, πρέσβα Κλυμένοιο θυγατρῶν. οἱ μὲν ἔπειτʼ ἀνελόντες ἀπὸ χθονὸς εὐρυοδείης ἔσχον· ἀτὰρ σφάξεν Πεισίστρατος, ὄρχαμος ἀνδρῶν.
“My sons, up, yoke for Telemachus horses with beautiful mane beneath the car, that he may get forward on his journey.” So he spoke, and they readily hearkened and obeyed; and quickly they yoked beneath the car the swift horses. And the housewife placed in the car bread and wine	τῆς δʼ ἐπεὶ ἐκ μέλαν αἷμα ῥύη, λίπε δʼ ὀστέα θυμός, αἶψʼ ἄρα μιν διέχευαν, ἄφαρ δʼ ἐκ μηρία τάμνον πάντα κατὰ μοῖραν, κατά τε κνίσῃ ἐκάλυψαν δίπτυχα ποιήσαντες, ἐπʼ αὐτῶν δʼ ὠμοθέτησαν. καῖε δʼ ἐπὶ σχίζῃς ὁ γέρων, ἐπὶ δʼ αἴθοπα οἶνον
 and dainties, such as kings, fostered of Zeus, are wont to eat. Then Telemachus mounted the beautiful car, and Peisistratus, son of Nestor, a leader of men, mounted beside him, and took the reins in his hands. He touched the horses with the whip to start them, and nothing loath the pair sped on	λεῖβε· νέοι δὲ παρʼ αὐτὸν ἔχον πεμπώβολα χερσίν. αὐτὰρ ἐπεὶ κατὰ μῆρʼ ἐκάη καὶ σπλάγχνα πάσαντο, μίστυλλόν τʼ ἄρα τἆλλα καὶ ἀμφʼ ὀβελοῖσιν ἔπειραν, ὤπτων δʼ ἀκροπόρους ὀβελοὺς ἐν χερσὶν ἔχοντες. τόφρα δὲ Τηλέμαχον λοῦσεν καλὴ Πολυκάστη,
to the plain, and left the steep citadel of Pylos . So all day long they shook the yoke which they bore about their necks. Now the sun set and all the ways grew dark. And they came to Pherae, to the house of Diocles, son of Ortilochus, whom Alpheus begot.	Νέστορος ὁπλοτάτη θυγάτηρ Νηληϊάδαο. αὐτὰρ ἐπεὶ λοῦσέν τε καὶ ἔχρισεν λίπʼ ἐλαίῳ, ἀμφὶ δέ μιν φᾶρος καλὸν βάλεν ἠδὲ χιτῶνα, ἔκ ῥʼ ἀσαμίνθου βῆ δέμας ἀθανάτοισιν ὁμοῖος· πὰρ δʼ ὅ γε Νέστορʼ ἰὼν κατʼ ἄρʼ ἕζετο, ποιμένα λαῶν.
There they spent the night, and before them he set the entertainment due to strangers. So soon as early Dawn appeared, the rosy-fingered, they yoked the horses and mounted the inlaid car, and drove forth from the gateway and the echoing portico. Then Peisistratus touched the horses with the whip to start them, and nothing loath the pair sped onward.	οἱ δʼ ἐπεὶ ὤπτησαν κρέʼ ὑπέρτερα καὶ ἐρύσαντο, δαίνυνθʼ ἑζόμενοι· ἐπὶ δʼ ἀνέρες ἐσθλοὶ ὄροντο οἶνον οἰνοχοεῦντες ἐνὶ χρυσέοις δεπάεσσιν. αὐτὰρ ἐπεὶ πόσιος καὶ ἐδητύος ἐξ ἔρον ἕντο, τοῖσι δὲ μύθων ἦρχε Γερήνιος ἱππότα Νέστωρ·
 So they came to the wheat-bearing plain, and thereafter pressed on toward their journey's end, so well did their swift horses bear them on. And the sun set and all the ways grew dark.	παῖδες ἐμοί, ἄγε Τηλεμάχῳ καλλίτριχας ἵππους ζεύξαθʼ ὑφʼ ἅρματʼ ἄγοντες, ἵνα πρήσσῃσιν ὁδοῖο. ὣς ἔφαθʼ, οἱ δʼ ἄρα τοῦ μάλα μὲν κλύον ἠδʼ ἐπίθοντο, καρπαλίμως δʼ ἔζευξαν ὑφʼ ἅρμασιν ὠκέας ἵππους. ἐν δὲ γυνὴ ταμίη σῖτον καὶ οἶνον ἔθηκεν
And they came to the hollow land of Lacedaemon with its many ravines, and drove to the palace of glorious Menelaus. Him they found giving a marriage feast to his many kinsfolk for his noble son and daughter within his house.	ἐς πεδίον, λιπέτην δὲ Πύλου αἰπὺ πτολίεθρον. οἱ δὲ πανημέριοι σεῖον ζυγὸν ἀμφὶς ἔχοντες. δύσετό τʼ ἠέλιος σκιόωντό τε πᾶσαι ἀγυιαί, ἐς Φηρὰς δʼ ἵκοντο Διοκλῆος ποτὶ δῶμα, υἱέος Ὀρτιλόχοιο, τὸν Ἀλφειὸς τέκε παῖδα.
His daughter he was sending to the son of Achilles, breaker of the ranks of men, for in the land of Troy he first had promised and pledged that he would give her, and now the gods were bringing their marriage to pass. Her then he was sending forth with horses and chariots to go her way to the glorious city of the Myrmidons, over whom her lord was king;	ἔνθα δὲ νύκτʼ ἄεσαν, ὁ δὲ τοῖς πὰρ ξείνια θῆκεν. ἦμος δʼ ἠριγένεια φάνη ῥοδοδάκτυλος Ἠώς, ἵππους τε ζεύγνυντʼ ἀνά θʼ ἅρματα ποικίλʼ ἔβαινον· ἐκ δʼ ἔλασαν προθύροιο καὶ αἰθούσης ἐριδούπου· μάστιξεν δʼ ἐλάαν, τὼ δʼ οὐκ ἀέκοντε πετέσθην.
but for his son he was bringing to his home from Sparta the daughter of Alector, even for the stalwart Megapenthes, who was his son well-beloved, born of a slave woman; for to Helen the gods vouchsafed issue no more after that she had at the first borne her lovely child, Hermione, who had the beauty of golden Aphrodite.	ἷξον δʼ ἐς πεδίον πυρηφόρον, ἔνθα δʼ ἔπειτα ἦνον ὁδόν· τοῖον γὰρ ὑπέκφερον ὠκέες ἵπποι. δύσετό τʼ ἠέλιος σκιόωντό τε πᾶσαι ἀγυιαί.
 Then the two, the prince Telemachus and the glorious son of Nestor, halted at the gateway of the palace, they and their two horses. And the lord Eteoneus came forth and saw them, the busy squire of glorious Menelaus; and he went through the hall to bear the tidings to the shepherd of the people.	οἱ δʼ ἷξον κοίλην Λακεδαίμονα κητώεσσαν, πρὸς δʼ ἄρα δώματʼ ἔλων Μενελάου κυδαλίμοιο. τὸν δʼ εὗρον δαινύντα γάμον πολλοῖσιν ἔτῃσιν υἱέος ἠδὲ θυγατρὸς ἀμύμονος ᾧ ἐνὶ οἴκῳ.
So he came near and spoke to him winged words: “Here are two strangers, Menelaus, fostered of Zeus, two men that are like the seed of great Zeus. But tell me, shall we unyoke for them their swift horses, or send them on their way to some other host, who will give them entertainment?”	τὴν μὲν Ἀχιλλῆος ῥηξήνορος υἱέι πέμπεν· ἐν Τροίῃ γὰρ πρῶτον ὑπέσχετο καὶ κατένευσε δωσέμεναι, τοῖσιν δὲ θεοὶ γάμον ἐξετέλειον. τὴν ἄρʼ ὅ γʼ ἔνθʼ ἵπποισι καὶ ἅρμασι πέμπε νέεσθαι Μυρμιδόνων προτὶ ἄστυ περικλυτόν, οἷσιν ἄνασσεν.
 Then, stirred to sore displeasure, fair-haired Menelaus spoke to him: “Aforetime thou was not wont to be a fool, Eteoneus, son of Boethous, but now like a child thou talkest folly. Surely we two ate full often hospitable cheer of other men, ere we came hither in the hope that Zeus	υἱέι δὲ Σπάρτηθεν Ἀλέκτορος ἤγετο κούρην, ὅς οἱ τηλύγετος γένετο κρατερὸς Μεγαπένθης ἐκ δούλης· Ἑλένῃ δὲ θεοὶ γόνον οὐκέτʼ ἔφαινον, ἐπεὶ δὴ τὸ πρῶτον ἐγείνατο παῖδʼ ἐρατεινήν, Ἑρμιόνην, ἣ εἶδος ἔχε χρυσέης Ἀφροδίτης.
would hereafter grant us respite from sorrow. Nay, unyoke the strangers' horses, and lead the men forward into the house, that they may feast.” So he spoke, and the other hastened through the hall, and called to the other busy squires to follow along with him. They loosed the sweating horses from beneath the yoke	ὣς οἱ μὲν δαίνυντο καθʼ ὑψερεφὲς μέγα δῶμα γείτονες ἠδὲ ἔται Μενελάου κυδαλίμοιο, τερπόμενοι· μετὰ δέ σφιν ἐμέλπετο θεῖος ἀοιδὸς φορμίζων, δοιὼ δὲ κυβιστητῆρε κατʼ αὐτούς, μολπῆς ἐξάρχοντος, ἐδίνευον κατὰ μέσσους.
 and tied them at the stalls of the horses, and flung before them spelt, and mixed therewith white barley. Then they tilted the chariot against the bright entrance walls, and led the men into the divine palace. But at the sight they marvelled as they passed through the palace of the king, fostered of Zeus;	τὼ δʼ αὖτʼ ἐν προθύροισι δόμων αὐτώ τε καὶ ἵππω, Τηλέμαχός θʼ ἥρως καὶ Νέστορος ἀγλαὸς υἱός, στῆσαν· ὁ δὲ προμολὼν ἴδετο κρείων Ἐτεωνεύς, ὀτρηρὸς θεράπων Μενελάου κυδαλίμοιο, βῆ δʼ ἴμεν ἀγγελέων διὰ δώματα ποιμένι λαῶν,
for there was a gleam as of sun or moon over the high-roofed house of glorious Menelaus. But when they had satisfied their eyes with gazing they went into the polished baths and bathed. And when the maids had bathed them and anointed them with oil,	ἀγχοῦ δʼ ἱστάμενος ἔπεα πτερόεντα προσηύδα· ξείνω δή τινε τώδε, διοτρεφὲς ὦ Μενέλαε, ἄνδρε δύω, γενεῇ δὲ Διὸς μεγάλοιο ἔικτον. ἀλλʼ εἴπʼ, ἤ σφωιν καταλύσομεν ὠκέας ἵππους, ἦ ἄλλον πέμπωμεν ἱκανέμεν, ὅς κε φιλήσῃ.
 and had cast about them fleecy cloaks and tunics, they sat down on chairs beside Menelaus, son of Atreus. Then a handmaid brought water for the hands in a fair pitcher of gold, and poured it over a silver basin for them to wash, and beside them drew up a polished table.	τὸν δὲ μέγʼ ὀχθήσας προσέφη ξανθὸς Μενέλαος· οὐ μὲν νήπιος ἦσθα, Βοηθοΐδη Ἐτεωνεῦ, τὸ πρίν· ἀτὰρ μὲν νῦν γε πάϊς ὣς νήπια βάζεις. ἦ μὲν δὴ νῶι ξεινήια πολλὰ φαγόντε ἄλλων ἀνθρώπων δεῦρʼ ἱκόμεθʼ, αἴ κέ ποθι Ζεὺς
And the grave housewife brought and set before them bread, and therewith dainties in abundance, giving freely of her store. And a carver lifted up and placed before them platters of all manner of meats, and set by them golden goblets. Then fair-haired Menelaus greeted the two and said:	ἐξοπίσω περ παύσῃ ὀιζύος. ἀλλὰ λύʼ ἵππους ξείνων, ἐς δʼ αὐτοὺς προτέρω ἄγε θοινηθῆναι. ὣς φάθʼ, ὁ δὲ μεγάροιο διέσσυτο, κέκλετο δʼ ἄλλους ὀτρηροὺς θεράποντας ἅμα σπέσθαι ἑοῖ αὐτῷ. οἱ δʼ ἵππους μὲν λῦσαν ὑπὸ ζυγοῦ ἱδρώοντας,
“Take of the food, and be glad, and then when you have supped, we will ask you who among men you are; for in you two the breed of your sires is not lost, but ye are of the breed of men that are sceptred kings, fostered of Zeus; for base churls could not beget such sons as you.”	καὶ τοὺς μὲν κατέδησαν ἐφʼ ἱππείῃσι κάπῃσι, πὰρ δʼ ἔβαλον ζειάς, ἀνὰ δὲ κρῖ λευκὸν ἔμιξαν, ἅρματα δʼ ἔκλιναν πρὸς ἐνώπια παμφανόωντα, αὐτοὺς δʼ εἰσῆγον θεῖον δόμον. οἱ δὲ ἰδόντες θαύμαζον κατὰ δῶμα διοτρεφέος βασιλῆος·
 So saying he took in his hands roast meat and set it before them, even the fat ox-chine which they had set before himself as a mess of honor. So they put forth their hands to the good cheer lying ready before them. But when they had put from them the desire of food and drink, lo, then Telemachus spoke to the son of Nestor,	ὥς τε γὰρ ἠελίου αἴγλη πέλεν ἠὲ σελήνης δῶμα καθʼ ὑψερεφὲς Μενελάου κυδαλίμοιο. αὐτὰρ ἐπεὶ τάρπησαν ὁρώμενοι ὀφθαλμοῖσιν, ἔς ῥʼ ἀσαμίνθους βάντες ἐυξέστας λούσαντο. τοὺς δʼ ἐπεὶ οὖν δμῳαὶ λοῦσαν καὶ χρῖσαν ἐλαίῳ,
holding his head close to him, that the others might not hear: “Son of Nestor, dear to this heart of mine, mark the flashing of bronze throughout the echoing halls, and the flashing of gold, of electrum, of silver, and of ivory. Of such sort, methinks, is the court of Olympian Zeus within,	ἀμφὶ δʼ ἄρα χλαίνας οὔλας βάλον ἠδὲ χιτῶνας, ἔς ῥα θρόνους ἕζοντο παρʼ Ἀτρεΐδην Μενέλαον. χέρνιβα δʼ ἀμφίπολος προχόῳ ἐπέχευε φέρουσα καλῇ χρυσείῃ ὑπὲρ ἀργυρέοιο λέβητος, νίψασθαι· παρὰ δὲ ξεστὴν ἐτάνυσσε τράπεζαν.
such untold wealth is here; amazement holds me as I look.” Now as he spoke fair-haired Menelaus heard him, and he spoke and addressed them with winged words: “Dear children, with Zeus verily no mortal man could vie, for everlasting are his halls and his possessions;	σῖτον δʼ αἰδοίη ταμίη παρέθηκε φέρουσα, εἴδατα πόλλʼ ἐπιθεῖσα, χαριζομένη παρεόντων. δαιτρὸς δὲ κρειῶν πίνακας παρέθηκεν ἀείρας παντοίων, παρὰ δέ σφι τίθει χρύσεια κύπελλα. τὼ καὶ δεικνύμενος προσέφη ξανθὸς Μενέλαος·
but of men another might vie with me in wealth or haply might not. For of a truth after many woes and wide wanderings I brought my wealth home in my ships and came in the eighth year. Over Cyprus and Phoenicia I wandered, and Egypt , and I came to the Ethiopians and the Sidonians and the Erembi,	σίτου θʼ ἅπτεσθον καὶ χαίρετον. αὐτὰρ ἔπειτα δείπνου πασσαμένω εἰρησόμεθʼ, οἵ τινές ἐστον ἀνδρῶν· οὐ γὰρ σφῷν γε γένος ἀπόλωλε τοκήων, ἀλλʼ ἀνδρῶν γένος ἐστὲ διοτρεφέων βασιλήων σκηπτούχων, ἐπεὶ οὔ κε κακοὶ τοιούσδε τέκοιεν.
and to Libya , where the lambs are horned from their birth. For there the ewes bear their young thrice within the full course of the year; there neither master nor shepherd has any lack of cheese or of meat or of sweet milk, but the flocks ever yield milk to the milking the year through.	ὣς φάτο, καί σφιν νῶτα βοὸς παρὰ πίονα θῆκεν ὄπτʼ ἐν χερσὶν ἑλών, τά ῥά οἱ γέρα πάρθεσαν αὐτῷ. οἱ δʼ ἐπʼ ὀνείαθʼ ἑτοῖμα προκείμενα χεῖρας ἴαλλον. αὐτὰρ ἐπεὶ πόσιος καὶ ἐδητύος ἐξ ἔρον ἕντο, δὴ τότε Τηλέμαχος προσεφώνεε Νέστορος υἱόν,
 While I wandered in those lands gathering much livelihood, meanwhile another slew my brother by stealth and at unawares, by the guile of his accursed wife. Thus, thou mayest see, I have no joy in being lord of this wealth; and you may well have heard of this from your fathers, whosoever they	ἄγχι σχὼν κεφαλήν, ἵνα μὴ πευθοίαθʼ οἱ ἄλλοι· φράζεο, Νεστορίδη, τῷ ἐμῷ κεχαρισμένε θυμῷ, χαλκοῦ τε στεροπὴν κὰδ δώματα ἠχήεντα χρυσοῦ τʼ ἠλέκτρου τε καὶ ἀργύρου ἠδʼ ἐλέφαντος. Ζηνός που τοιήδε γʼ Ὀλυμπίου ἔνδοθεν αὐλή,
may be, for full much did I suffer, and let fall into ruin a stately house and one stored with much goodly treasure. Would that I dwelt in my halls with but a third part of this wealth, and that those men were safe who then perished in the broad land of Troy far from horse-pasturing Argos .	ὅσσα τάδʼ ἄσπετα πολλά· σέβας μʼ ἔχει εἰσορόωντα. τοῦ δʼ ἀγορεύοντος ξύνετο ξανθὸς Μενέλαος, καί σφεας φωνήσας ἔπεα πτερόεντα προσηύδα· τέκνα φίλʼ, ἦ τοι Ζηνὶ βροτῶν οὐκ ἄν τις ἐρίζοι· ἀθάνατοι γὰρ τοῦ γε δόμοι καὶ κτήματʼ ἔασιν·
 And yet, though I often sit in my halls weeping and sorrowing for them all—one moment indeed I ease my heart with weeping, and then again I cease, for men soon have surfeit of chill lament—yet for them all I mourn not so much, despite my grief,	ἀνδρῶν δʼ ἤ κέν τίς μοι ἐρίσσεται, ἠὲ καὶ οὐκί, κτήμασιν. ἦ γὰρ πολλὰ παθὼν καὶ πόλλʼ ἐπαληθεὶς ἠγαγόμην ἐν νηυσὶ καὶ ὀγδοάτῳ ἔτει ἦλθον, Κύπρον Φοινίκην τε καὶ Αἰγυπτίους ἐπαληθείς, Αἰθίοπάς θʼ ἱκόμην καὶ Σιδονίους καὶ Ἐρεμβοὺς
 as for one only, who makes me to loathe both sleep and food, when I think of him; for no one of the Achaeans toiled so much as Odysseus toiled and endured. But to himself, as it seems, his portion was to be but woe, and for me there is sorrow never to be forgotten for him, in that he is gone so long, nor do we know aught	καὶ Λιβύην, ἵνα τʼ ἄρνες ἄφαρ κεραοὶ τελέθουσι. τρὶς γὰρ τίκτει μῆλα τελεσφόρον εἰς ἐνιαυτόν. ἔνθα μὲν οὔτε ἄναξ ἐπιδευὴς οὔτε τι ποιμὴν τυροῦ καὶ κρειῶν οὐδὲ γλυκεροῖο γάλακτος, ἀλλʼ αἰεὶ παρέχουσιν ἐπηετανὸν γάλα θῆσθαι.
whether he be alive or dead. Mourned is he, I ween, by the old man Laertes, and by constant Penelope, and by Telemachus, whom he left a new-born child in his house.” So he spoke, and in Telemachus he roused the desire to weep for his father. Tears from his eyelids he let fall upon the ground, when he heard his father's name,	ἧος ἐγὼ περὶ κεῖνα πολὺν βίοτον συναγείρων ἠλώμην, τῆός μοι ἀδελφεὸν ἄλλος ἔπεφνεν λάθρῃ, ἀνωιστί, δόλῳ οὐλομένης ἀλόχοιο· ὣς οὔ τοι χαίρων τοῖσδε κτεάτεσσιν ἀνάσσω. καὶ πατέρων τάδε μέλλετʼ ἀκουέμεν, οἵ τινες ὑμῖν
and with both hands held up his purple cloak before his eyes. And Menelaus noted him, and debated in mind and heart whether he should leave him to speak of his father himself, or whether he should first question him and prove him in each thing.	εἰσίν, ἐπεὶ μάλα πολλὰ πάθον, καὶ ἀπώλεσα οἶκον εὖ μάλα ναιετάοντα, κεχανδότα πολλὰ καὶ ἐσθλά. ὧν ὄφελον τριτάτην περ ἔχων ἐν δώμασι μοῖραν ναίειν, οἱ δʼ ἄνδρες σόοι ἔμμεναι, οἳ τότʼ ὄλοντο Τροίῃ ἐν εὐρείῃ ἑκὰς Ἄργεος ἱπποβότοιο.
and Phylo a silver basket, which Alcandre had given her, the wife of Polybus, who dwelt in Thebes of Egypt , where greatest store of wealth is laid up in men's houses. He gave to Menelaus two silver baths and two tripods and ten talents of gold.	ἀλλʼ ἔμπης πάντας μὲν ὀδυρόμενος καὶ ἀχεύων πολλάκις ἐν μεγάροισι καθήμενος ἡμετέροισιν ἄλλοτε μέν τε γόῳ φρένα τέρπομαι, ἄλλοτε δʼ αὖτε παύομαι· αἰψηρὸς δὲ κόρος κρυεροῖο γόοιο. τῶν πάντων οὐ τόσσον ὀδύρομαι, ἀχνύμενός περ,
And besides these, his wife gave to Helen also beautiful gifts,—a golden distaff and a basket with wheels beneath did she give, a basket of silver, and with gold were the rims thereof gilded. This then the handmaid, Phylo, brought and placed beside her, filled with finely-spun yarn, and across it	ὡς ἑνός, ὅς τέ μοι ὕπνον ἀπεχθαίρει καὶ ἐδωδὴν μνωομένῳ, ἐπεὶ οὔ τις Ἀχαιῶν τόσσʼ ἐμόγησεν, ὅσσʼ Ὀδυσεὺς ἐμόγησε καὶ ἤρατο. τῷ δʼ ἄρʼ ἔμελλεν αὐτῷ κήδεʼ ἔσεσθαι, ἐμοὶ δʼ ἄχος αἰὲν ἄλαστον κείνου, ὅπως δὴ δηρὸν ἀποίχεται, οὐδέ τι ἴδμεν,
was laid the distaff laden with violet-dark wool. So Helen sat down upon the chair, and below was a footstool for the feet; and at once she questioned her husband on each matter, and said: “Do we know, Menelaus, fostered of Zeus, who these men declare themselves to be who have come to our house?	ζώει ὅ γʼ ἦ τέθνηκεν. ὀδύρονταί νύ που αὐτὸν Λαέρτης θʼ ὁ γέρων καὶ ἐχέφρων Πηνελόπεια Τηλέμαχός θʼ, ὃν ἔλειπε νέον γεγαῶτʼ ἐνὶ οἴκῳ. ὣς φάτο, τῷ δʼ ἄρα πατρὸς ὑφʼ ἵμερον ὦρσε γόοιο. δάκρυ δʼ ἀπὸ βλεφάρων χαμάδις βάλε πατρὸς ἀκούσας,
Shall I disguise my thought, or speak the truth? Nay, my heart bids me speak. For never yet, I declare, saw I one so like another, whether man or woman—amazement holds me, as I look—as this man is like the son of great-hearted Odysseus, even Telemachus, whom that warrior left a new-born child in his house, when for the sake of shameless me ye Achaeans came up under the walls of Troy , pondering in your hearts fierce war.” Then fair-haired Menelaus answered her: “Even so do I myself now note it, wife, as thou markest the likeness. Such were his feet, such his hands,	χλαῖναν πορφυρέην ἄντʼ ὀφθαλμοῖιν ἀνασχὼν ἀμφοτέρῃσιν χερσί. νόησε δέ μιν Μενέλαος, μερμήριξε δʼ ἔπειτα κατὰ φρένα καὶ κατὰ θυμόν, ἠέ μιν αὐτὸν πατρὸς ἐάσειε μνησθῆναι ἦ πρῶτʼ ἐξερέοιτο ἕκαστά τε πειρήσαιτο.
and the glances of his eyes, and his head and hair above. And verily but now, as I made mention of Odysseus and was telling of all the woe and toil he endured for my sake, this youth let fall a bitter tear from beneath his brows, holding up his purple cloak before his eyes.”	ἧος ὁ ταῦθʼ ὥρμαινε κατὰ φρένα καὶ κατὰ θυμόν, ἐκ δʼ Ἑλένη θαλάμοιο θυώδεος ὑψορόφοιο ἤλυθεν Ἀρτέμιδι χρυσηλακάτῳ ἐικυῖα. τῇ δʼ ἄρʼ ἅμʼ Ἀδρήστη κλισίην εὔτυκτον ἔθηκεν, Ἀλκίππη δὲ τάπητα φέρεν μαλακοῦ ἐρίοιο,
 Then Peisistratus, son of Nestor, answered him:“Menelaus, son of Atreus, fostered of Zeus, leader of hosts, his son indeed this youth is, as thou sayest. But he is of prudent mind and feels shame at heart thus on his first coming to make a show of forward words	Φυλὼ δʼ ἀργύρεον τάλαρον φέρε, τόν οἱ ἔθηκεν Ἀλκάνδρη, Πολύβοιο δάμαρ, ὃς ἔναιʼ ἐνὶ Θήβῃς Αἰγυπτίῃς, ὅθι πλεῖστα δόμοις ἐν κτήματα κεῖται· ὃς Μενελάῳ δῶκε δύʼ ἀργυρέας ἀσαμίνθους, δοιοὺς δὲ τρίποδας, δέκα δὲ χρυσοῖο τάλαντα.
in the presence of thee, in whose voice we both take delight as in a god's. But the horseman, Nestor of Gerenia , sent me forth to go with him as his guide, for he was eager to see thee, that thou mightest put in his heart some word or some deed. For many sorrows has a son	χωρὶς δʼ αὖθʼ Ἑλένῃ ἄλοχος πόρε κάλλιμα δῶρα· χρυσέην τʼ ἠλακάτην τάλαρόν θʼ ὑπόκυκλον ὄπασσεν ἀργύρεον, χρυσῷ δʼ ἐπὶ χείλεα κεκράαντο. τόν ῥά οἱ ἀμφίπολος Φυλὼ παρέθηκε φέρουσα νήματος ἀσκητοῖο βεβυσμένον· αὐτὰρ ἐπʼ αὐτῷ
in his halls when his father is gone, when there are none other to be his helpers, even as it is now with Telemachus; his father is gone, and there are no others among the people who might ward off ruin.” Then fair-haired Menelaus answered him and said: “Lo now, verily is there come to my house the son of a man well-beloved,	ἠλακάτη τετάνυστο ἰοδνεφὲς εἶρος ἔχουσα. ἕζετο δʼ ἐν κλισμῷ, ὑπὸ δὲ θρῆνυς ποσὶν ἦεν. αὐτίκα δʼ ἥ γʼ ἐπέεσσι πόσιν ἐρέεινεν ἕκαστα· ἴδμεν δή, Μενέλαε διοτρεφές, οἵ τινες οἵδε ἀνδρῶν εὐχετόωνται ἱκανέμεν ἡμέτερον δῶ;
who for my sake endured many toils. And I thought that if he came back I should give him welcome beyond all the other Argives, if Olympian Zeus, whose voice is borne afar, had granted to us two a return in our swift ships over the sea. And in Argos I would have given him a city to dwell in, and would have built him a house,	ψεύσομαι ἦ ἔτυμον ἐρέω; κέλεται δέ με θυμός. οὐ γάρ πώ τινά φημι ἐοικότα ὧδε ἰδέσθαι οὔτʼ ἄνδρʼ οὔτε γυναῖκα, σέβας μʼ ἔχει εἰσορόωσαν, ὡς ὅδʼ Ὀδυσσῆος μεγαλήτορος υἷι ἔοικε, Τηλεμάχῳ, τὸν ἔλειπε νέον γεγαῶτʼ ἐνὶ οἴκῳ κεῖνος ἀνήρ, ὅτʼ ἐμεῖο κυνώπιδος εἵνεκʼ Ἀχαιοὶ ἤλθεθʼ ὑπὸ Τροίην πόλεμον θρασὺν ὁρμαίνοντες. τὴν δʼ ἀπαμειβόμενος προσέφη ξανθὸς Μενέλαος· οὕτω νῦν καὶ ἐγὼ νοέω, γύναι, ὡς σὺ ἐίσκεις· κείνου γὰρ τοιοίδε πόδες τοιαίδε τε χεῖρες
when I had brought him from Ithaca with his goods and his son and all his people, driving out the dwellers of some one city among those that lie round about and obey me myself as their lord. Then, living here, should we ofttimes have met together, nor would aught have parted us, loving and joying in one another,	ὀφθαλμῶν τε βολαὶ κεφαλή τʼ ἐφύπερθέ τε χαῖται. καὶ νῦν ἦ τοι ἐγὼ μεμνημένος ἀμφʼ Ὀδυσῆι μυθεόμην, ὅσα κεῖνος ὀιζύσας ἐμόγησεν ἀμφʼ ἐμοί, αὐτὰρ ὁ πικρὸν ὑπʼ ὀφρύσι δάκρυον εἶβε, χλαῖναν πορφυρέην ἄντʼ ὀφθαλμοῖιν ἀνασχών.
until the black cloud of death enfolded us. Howbeit of this, methinks, the god himself must have been jealous, who to that hapless man alone vouchsafed no return.” So he spoke, and in them all aroused the desire of lament. Argive Helen wept, the daughter of Zeus,	τὸν δʼ αὖ Νεστορίδης Πεισίστρατος ἀντίον ηὔδα· Ἀτρεΐδη Μενέλαε διοτρεφές, ὄρχαμε λαῶν, κείνου μέν τοι ὅδʼ υἱὸς ἐτήτυμον, ὡς ἀγορεύεις· ἀλλὰ σαόφρων ἐστί, νεμεσσᾶται δʼ ἐνὶ θυμῷ ὧδʼ ἐλθὼν τὸ πρῶτον ἐπεσβολίας ἀναφαίνειν
Telemachus wept, and Menelaus, son of Atreus, nor could the son of Nestor keep his eyes tearless. For he thought in his heart of peerless Antilochus, whom the glorious son of the bright Dawn had slain. Thinking of him, he spoke winged words:	ἄντα σέθεν, τοῦ νῶι θεοῦ ὣς τερπόμεθʼ αὐδῇ. αὐτὰρ ἐμὲ προέηκε Γερήνιος ἱππότα Νέστωρ τῷ ἅμα πομπὸν ἕπεσθαι· ἐέλδετο γάρ σε ἰδέσθαι, ὄφρα οἱ ἤ τι ἔπος ὑποθήσεαι ἠέ τι ἔργον. πολλὰ γὰρ ἄλγεʼ ἔχει πατρὸς πάϊς οἰχομένοιο
“Son of Atreus, old Nestor used ever to say that thou wast wise above all men, whenever we made mention of thee in his halls and questioned one another. And now, if it may in any wise be, hearken to me, for I take no joy in weeping at supper time, —and moreover	ἐν μεγάροις, ᾧ μὴ ἄλλοι ἀοσσητῆρες ἔωσιν, ὡς νῦν Τηλεμάχῳ ὁ μὲν οἴχεται, οὐδέ οἱ ἄλλοι εἴσʼ οἵ κεν κατὰ δῆμον ἀλάλκοιεν κακότητα. τὸν δʼ ἀπαμειβόμενος προσέφη ξανθὸς Μενέλαος· ὢ πόποι, ἦ μάλα δὴ φίλου ἀνέρος υἱὸς ἐμὸν δῶ
early dawn will soon be here. I count it indeed no blame to weep for any mortal who has died and met his fate. Yea, this is the only due we pay to miserable mortals, to cut the hair and let a tear fall from the cheeks. For a brother of mine, too, is dead, nowise the meanest	ἵκεθʼ, ὃς εἵνεκʼ ἐμεῖο πολέας ἐμόγησεν ἀέθλους· καί μιν ἔφην ἐλθόντα φιλησέμεν ἔξοχον ἄλλων Ἀργείων, εἰ νῶιν ὑπεὶρ ἅλα νόστον ἔδωκε νηυσὶ θοῇσι γενέσθαι Ὀλύμπιος εὐρύοπα Ζεύς. καί κέ οἱ Ἄργεϊ νάσσα πόλιν καὶ δώματʼ ἔτευξα,
of the Argives, and thou mayest well have known him. As for me, I never met him nor saw him; but men say that Antilochus was above all others pre-eminent in speed of foot and as a warrior.” Then fair-haired Menelaus answered him and said: “My friend, truly thou hast said all that a wise man	ἐξ Ἰθάκης ἀγαγὼν σὺν κτήμασι καὶ τέκεϊ ᾧ καὶ πᾶσιν λαοῖσι, μίαν πόλιν ἐξαλαπάξας, αἳ περιναιετάουσιν, ἀνάσσονται δʼ ἐμοὶ αὐτῷ. καί κε θάμʼ ἐνθάδʼ ἐόντες ἐμισγόμεθʼ· οὐδέ κεν ἡμέας ἄλλο διέκρινεν φιλέοντέ τε τερπομένω τε,
 might say or do, even one that was older than thou; for from such a father art thou sprung, wherefore thou dost even speak wisely. Easily known is the seed of that man for whom the son of Cronos spins the thread of good fortune at marriage and at birth, even as now he has granted to Nestor throughout all his days continually that	πρίν γʼ ὅτε δὴ θανάτοιο μέλαν νέφος ἀμφεκάλυψεν. ἀλλὰ τὰ μέν που μέλλεν ἀγάσσεσθαι θεὸς αὐτός, ὃς κεῖνον δύστηνον ἀνόστιμον οἶον ἔθηκεν. ὣς φάτο, τοῖσι δὲ πᾶσιν ὑφʼ ἵμερον ὦρσε γόοιο. κλαῖε μὲν Ἀργείη Ἑλένη, Διὸς ἐκγεγαυῖα,
 he should himself reach a sleek old age in his halls, and that his sons in their turn should be wise and most valiant with the spear. But we will cease the weeping which but now was made, and let us once more think of our supper, and let them pour water over our hands. Tales there will be in the morning also	κλαῖε δὲ Τηλέμαχός τε καὶ Ἀτρεΐδης Μενέλαος, οὐδʼ ἄρα Νέστορος υἱὸς ἀδακρύτω ἔχεν ὄσσε· μνήσατο γὰρ κατὰ θυμὸν ἀμύμονος Ἀντιλόχοιο, τόν ῥʼ Ἠοῦς ἔκτεινε φαεινῆς ἀγλαὸς υἱός· τοῦ ὅ γʼ ἐπιμνησθεὶς ἔπεα πτερόεντʼ ἀγόρευεν·
for Telemachus and me to tell to one another to the full.” So he spoke, and Asphalion poured water over their hands, the busy squire of glorious Menelaus. And they put forth their hands to the good cheer lying ready before them. Then Helen, daughter of Zeus, took other counsel.	Ἀτρεΐδη, περὶ μέν σε βροτῶν πεπνυμένον εἶναι Νέστωρ φάσχʼ ὁ γέρων, ὅτʼ ἐπιμνησαίμεθα σεῖο οἷσιν ἐνὶ μεγάροισι, καὶ ἀλλήλους ἐρέοιμεν. καὶ νῦν, εἴ τί που ἔστι, πίθοιό μοι· οὐ γὰρ ἐγώ γε τέρπομʼ ὀδυρόμενος μεταδόρπιος, ἀλλὰ καὶ ἠὼς
 Straightway she cast into the wine of which they were drinking a drug to quiet all pain and strife, and bring forgetfulness of every ill. Whoso should drink this down, when it is mingled in the bowl, would not in the course of that day let a tear fall down over his cheeks,	ἔσσεται ἠριγένεια· νεμεσσῶμαί γε μὲν οὐδὲν κλαίειν ὅς κε θάνῃσι βροτῶν καὶ πότμον ἐπίσπῃ. τοῦτό νυ καὶ γέρας οἶον ὀιζυροῖσι βροτοῖσιν, κείρασθαί τε κόμην βαλέειν τʼ ἀπὸ δάκρυ παρειῶν. καὶ γὰρ ἐμὸς τέθνηκεν ἀδελφεός, οὔ τι κάκιστος
no, not though his mother and father should lie there dead, or though before his face men should slay with the sword his brother or dear son, and his own eyes beheld it. Such cunning drugs had the daughter of Zeus, drugs of healing, which Polydamna, the wife of Thon , had given her, a woman of Egypt , for there the earth, the giver of grain, bears greatest store	Ἀργείων· μέλλεις δὲ σὺ ἴδμεναι· οὐ γὰρ ἐγώ γε ἤντησʼ οὐδὲ ἴδον· περὶ δʼ ἄλλων φασὶ γενέσθαι Ἀντίλοχον, πέρι μὲν θείειν ταχὺν ἠδὲ μαχητήν. τὸν δʼ ἀπαμειβόμενος προσέφη ξανθὸς Μενέλαος· ὦ φίλʼ, ἐπεὶ τόσα εἶπες, ὅσʼ ἂν πεπνυμένος ἀνὴρ
of drugs, many that are healing when mixed, and many that are baneful; there every man is a physician, wise above human kind; for they are of the race of Paeeon. Now when she had cast in the drug, and had bidden pour forth the wine, again she made answer, and said:	εἴποι καὶ ῥέξειε, καὶ ὃς προγενέστερος εἴη· τοίου γὰρ καὶ πατρός, ὃ καὶ πεπνυμένα βάζεις, ῥεῖα δʼ ἀρίγνωτος γόνος ἀνέρος ᾧ τε Κρονίων ὄλβον ἐπικλώσῃ γαμέοντί τε γεινομένῳ τε, ὡς νῦν Νέστορι δῶκε διαμπερὲς ἤματα πάντα
 “Menelaus, son of Atreus, fostered of Zeus, and ye that are here, sons of noble men—though now to one and now to another Zeus gives good and ill, for he can do all things,—now verily sit ye in the halls and feast, and take ye joy in telling tales, for I will tell what fitteth the time.	αὐτὸν μὲν λιπαρῶς γηρασκέμεν ἐν μεγάροισιν, υἱέας αὖ πινυτούς τε καὶ ἔγχεσιν εἶναι ἀρίστους. ἡμεῖς δὲ κλαυθμὸν μὲν ἐάσομεν, ὃς πρὶν ἐτύχθη, δόρπου δʼ ἐξαῦτις μνησώμεθα, χερσὶ δʼ ἐφʼ ὕδωρ χευάντων. μῦθοι δὲ καὶ ἠῶθέν περ ἔσονται
 All things I cannot tell or recount, even all the labours of Odysseus of the steadfast heart; but what a thing was this which that mighty man wrought and endured in the land of the Trojans, where you Achaens suffered woes! Marring his own body with cruel blows,	Τηλεμάχῳ καὶ ἐμοὶ διαειπέμεν ἀλλήλοισιν. ὣς ἔφατʼ, Ἀσφαλίων δʼ ἄρʼ ὕδωρ ἐπὶ χεῖρας ἔχευεν, ὀτρηρὸς θεράπων Μενελάου κυδαλίμοιο. οἱ δʼ ἐπʼ ὀνείαθʼ ἑτοῖμα προκείμενα χεῖρας ἴαλλον. ἔνθʼ αὖτʼ ἄλλʼ ἐνόησʼ Ἑλένη Διὸς ἐκγεγαυῖα·
and flinging a wretched garment about his shoulders, in the fashion of a slave he entered the broad-wayed city of the foe, and he hid himself under the likeness of another, a beggar, he who was in no wise such an one at the ships of the Achaeans. In this likeness he entered the city of the Trojans, and all of them were but as babes.	αὐτίκʼ ἄρʼ εἰς οἶνον βάλε φάρμακον, ἔνθεν ἔπινον, νηπενθές τʼ ἄχολόν τε, κακῶν ἐπίληθον ἁπάντων. ὃς τὸ καταβρόξειεν, ἐπὴν κρητῆρι μιγείη, οὔ κεν ἐφημέριός γε βάλοι κατὰ δάκρυ παρειῶν, οὐδʼ εἴ οἱ κατατεθναίη μήτηρ τε πατήρ τε,
 I alone recognized him in this disguise, and questioned him, but he in his cunning sought to avoid me. Howbeit when I was bathing him and anointing him with oil, and had put on him raiment, and sworn a mighty oath not to make him known among the Trojans as Odysseus	οὐδʼ εἴ οἱ προπάροιθεν ἀδελφεὸν ἢ φίλον υἱὸν χαλκῷ δηιόῳεν, ὁ δʼ ὀφθαλμοῖσιν ὁρῷτο. τοῖα Διὸς θυγάτηρ ἔχε φάρμακα μητιόεντα, ἐσθλά, τά οἱ Πολύδαμνα πόρεν, Θῶνος παράκοιτις Αἰγυπτίη, τῇ πλεῖστα φέρει ζείδωρος ἄρουρα
 before that he reached the swift ships and the huts, then at length he told me all the purpose of the Achaeans. And when he had slain many of the Trojans with the long sword, he returned to the company of the Argives and brought back plentiful tidings. Then the other Trojan women wailed aloud, but my soul	φάρμακα, πολλὰ μὲν ἐσθλὰ μεμιγμένα πολλὰ δὲ λυγρά· ἰητρὸς δὲ ἕκαστος ἐπιστάμενος περὶ πάντων ἀνθρώπων· ἦ γὰρ Παιήονός εἰσι γενέθλης. αὐτὰρ ἐπεί ῥʼ ἐνέηκε κέλευσέ τε οἰνοχοῆσαι, ἐξαῦτις μύθοισιν ἀμειβομένη προσέειπεν·
was glad, for already my heart was turned to go back to my home, and I groaned for the blindness that Aphrodite gave me, when she led me thither from my dear native land, forsaking my child and my bridal chamber, and my husband, a man who lacked nothing, whether in wisdom or in comeliness.”	Ἀτρεΐδη Μενέλαε διοτρεφὲς ἠδὲ καὶ οἵδε ἀνδρῶν ἐσθλῶν παῖδες· ἀτὰρ θεὸς ἄλλοτε ἄλλῳ Ζεὺς ἀγαθόν τε κακόν τε διδοῖ· δύναται γὰρ ἅπαντα· ἦ τοι νῦν δαίνυσθε καθήμενοι ἐν μεγάροισι καὶ μύθοις τέρπεσθε· ἐοικότα γὰρ καταλέξω.
 Then fair-haired Menelaus answered her and said:“Aye verily, all this, wife, hast thou spoken aright. Ere now have I come to know the counsel and the mind of many warriors, and have travelled over the wide earth, but never yet have mine eyes beheld such an one	πάντα μὲν οὐκ ἂν ἐγὼ μυθήσομαι οὐδʼ ὀνομήνω, ὅσσοι Ὀδυσσῆος ταλασίφρονός εἰσιν ἄεθλοι· ἀλλʼ οἷον τόδʼ ἔρεξε καὶ ἔτλη καρτερὸς ἀνὴρ δήμῳ ἔνι Τρώων, ὅθι πάσχετε πήματʼ Ἀχαιοί. αὐτόν μιν πληγῇσιν ἀεικελίῃσι δαμάσσας,
 as was Odysseus of the steadfast heart. What a thing was this, too, which that mighty man wrought and endured in the carven horse, wherein all we chiefs of the Argives were sitting, bearing to the Trojans death and fate! Then thou camest thither, and it must be that thou wast bidden	σπεῖρα κάκʼ ἀμφʼ ὤμοισι βαλών, οἰκῆι ἐοικώς, ἀνδρῶν δυσμενέων κατέδυ πόλιν εὐρυάγυιαν· ἄλλῳ δʼ αὐτὸν φωτὶ κατακρύπτων ἤισκε, δέκτῃ, ὃς οὐδὲν τοῖος ἔην ἐπὶ νηυσὶν Ἀχαιῶν. τῷ ἴκελος κατέδυ Τρώων πόλιν, οἱ δʼ ἀβάκησαν
 by some god, who wished to grant glory to the Trojans, and godlike Deiphobus followed thee on thy way. Thrice didst thou go about the hollow ambush, trying it with thy touch, and thou didst name aloud the chieftains of the Danaans by their names, likening thy voice to the voices of the wives of all the Argives.	πάντες· ἐγὼ δέ μιν οἴη ἀνέγνων τοῖον ἐόντα, καί μιν ἀνηρώτων· ὁ δὲ κερδοσύνῃ ἀλέεινεν. ἀλλʼ ὅτε δή μιν ἐγὼ λόεον καὶ χρῖον ἐλαίῳ, ἀμφὶ δὲ εἵματα ἕσσα καὶ ὤμοσα καρτερὸν ὅρκον μὴ μὲν πρὶν Ὀδυσῆα μετὰ Τρώεσσʼ ἀναφῆναι,
 Now I and the son of Tydeus and goodly Odysseus sat there in the midst and heard how thou didst call, and we two were eager to rise up and come forth, or else to answer straightway from within, but Odysseus held us back and stayed us, despite our eagerness.	πρίν γε τὸν ἐς νῆάς τε θοὰς κλισίας τʼ ἀφικέσθαι, καὶ τότε δή μοι πάντα νόον κατέλεξεν Ἀχαιῶν. πολλοὺς δὲ Τρώων κτείνας ταναήκεϊ χαλκῷ ἦλθε μετʼ Ἀργείους, κατὰ δὲ φρόνιν ἤγαγε πολλήν. ἔνθʼ ἄλλαι Τρῳαὶ λίγʼ ἐκώκυον· αὐτὰρ ἐμὸν κῆρ
Then all the other sons of the Achaeans held their peace, but Anticlus alone was fain to speak and answer thee; but Odysseus firmly closed his mouth with strong hands, and saved all the Achaeans, and held him thus until Pallas Athena led thee away.”	χαῖρʼ, ἐπεὶ ἤδη μοι κραδίη τέτραπτο νέεσθαι ἂψ οἶκόνδʼ, ἄτην δὲ μετέστενον, ἣν Ἀφροδίτη δῶχʼ, ὅτε μʼ ἤγαγε κεῖσε φίλης ἀπὸ πατρίδος αἴης, παῖδά τʼ ἐμὴν νοσφισσαμένην θάλαμόν τε πόσιν τε οὔ τευ δευόμενον, οὔτʼ ἂρ φρένας οὔτε τι εἶδος.
by sweet sleep we may rest and take our joy.” Thus he spoke, and Argive Helen bade her handmaids place bedsteads beneath the portico, and to lay on them fair purple blankets, and to spread there over coverlets, and on these to put fleecy cloaks for clothing.	τὴν δʼ ἀπαμειβόμενος προσέφη ξανθὸς Μενέλαος· ναὶ δὴ ταῦτά γε πάντα, γύναι, κατὰ μοῖραν ἔειπες. ἤδη μὲν πολέων ἐδάην βουλήν τε νόον τε ἀνδρῶν ἡρώων, πολλὴν δʼ ἐπελήλυθα γαῖαν· ἀλλʼ οὔ πω τοιοῦτον ἐγὼν ἴδον ὀφθαλμοῖσιν,
 But the maids went forth from the hall with torches in their hands and strewed the couch, and a herald led forth the guests. So they slept there in the fore-hall of the palace, the prince Telemachus and the glorious son of Nestor; but the son of Atreus slept in the inmost chamber of the lofty house,	οἷoν Ὀδυσσῆος ταλασίφρονος ἔσκε φίλον κῆρ. οἷον καὶ τόδʼ ἔρεξε καὶ ἔτλη καρτερὸς ἀνὴρ ἵππῳ ἔνι ξεστῷ, ἵνʼ ἐνήμεθα πάντες ἄριστοι Ἀργείων Τρώεσσι φόνον καὶ κῆρα φέροντες. ἦλθες ἔπειτα σὺ κεῖσε· κελευσέμεναι δέ σʼ ἔμελλε
and beside him lay long-robed Helen, peerless among women. So soon as early Dawn appeared, the rosy-fingered, up from his bed arose Menelaus, good at the war-cry, and put on his clothing. About his shoulders he slung his sharp sword, and beneath his shining feet bound his fair sandals,	δαίμων, ὃς Τρώεσσιν ἐβούλετο κῦδος ὀρέξαι· καί τοι Δηΐφοβος θεοείκελος ἕσπετʼ ἰούσῃ. τρὶς δὲ περίστειξας κοῖλον λόχον ἀμφαφόωσα, ἐκ δʼ ὀνομακλήδην Δαναῶν ὀνόμαζες ἀρίστους, πάντων Ἀργείων φωνὴν ἴσκουσʼ ἀλόχοισιν.
and went forth from his chamber like unto a god to look upon. Then he sat down beside Telemachus, and spoke, and addressed him: “What need has brought thee hither, prince Telemachus, to goodly Lacedaemon over the broad back of the sea? Is it a public matter, or thine own? Tell me the truth of this.”	αὐτὰρ ἐγὼ καὶ Τυδεΐδης καὶ δῖος Ὀδυσσεὺς ἥμενοι ἐν μέσσοισιν ἀκούσαμεν ὡς ἐβόησας. νῶι μὲν ἀμφοτέρω μενεήναμεν ὁρμηθέντε ἢ ἐξελθέμεναι, ἢ ἔνδοθεν αἶψʼ ὑπακοῦσαι· ἀλλʼ Ὀδυσεὺς κατέρυκε καὶ ἔσχεθεν ἱεμένω περ.
 Then wise Telemachus answered him: “Menelaus, son of Atreus, fostered of Zeus, leader of hosts, I came if haply thou mightest tell me some tidings of my father. My home is being devoured and my rich lands are ruined; with men that are foes my house is filled, who are ever	ἔνθʼ ἄλλοι μὲν πάντες ἀκὴν ἔσαν υἷες Ἀχαιῶν, Ἄντικλος δὲ σέ γʼ οἶος ἀμείψασθαι ἐπέεσσιν ἤθελεν. ἀλλʼ Ὀδυσεὺς ἐπὶ μάστακα χερσὶ πίεζεν νωλεμέως κρατερῇσι, σάωσε δὲ πάντας Ἀχαιούς· τόφρα δʼ ἔχʼ, ὄφρα σε νόσφιν ἀπήγαγε Παλλὰς Ἀθήνη.
 slaying my thronging sheep and my sleek kine of shambling gait, even the wooers of my mother, overweening in their insolence. Therefore am I now come to thy knees, if perchance thou wilt be willing to tell me of his woeful death, whether thou sawest it haply with thine own eyes, or didst hear from some other the story	τὸν δʼ αὖ Τηλέμαχος πεπνυμένος ἀντίον ηὔδα· Ἀτρεΐδη Μενέλαε διοτρεφές, ὄρχαμε λαῶν, ἄλγιον· οὐ γάρ οἵ τι τάδʼ ἤρκεσε λυγρὸν ὄλεθρον, οὐδʼ εἴ οἱ κραδίη γε σιδηρέη ἔνδοθεν ἦεν. ἀλλʼ ἄγετʼ εἰς εὐνὴν τράπεθʼ ἡμέας, ὄφρα καὶ ἤδη
 of his wanderings; for beyond all men did his mother bear him to sorrow. And do thou no wise out of ruth or pity for me speak soothing words, but tell me truly how thou didst come to behold him. I beseech thee, if ever my father, noble Odysseus, promised aught to thee of word or deed and fulfilled it	ὕπνῳ ὕπο γλυκερῷ ταρπώμεθα κοιμηθέντες. ὣς ἔφατʼ, Ἀργείη δʼ Ἑλένη δμῳῇσι κέλευσεν δέμνιʼ ὑπʼ αἰθούσῃ θέμεναι καὶ ῥήγεα καλὰ πορφύρεʼ ἐμβαλέειν στορέσαι τʼ ἐφύπερθε τάπητας, χλαίνας τʼ ἐνθέμεναι οὔλας καθύπερθεν ἕσασθαι.
in the land of the Trojans, where you Achaeans suffered woes, be mindful of it now, I pray thee, and tell me the truth.” Then, stirred to sore displeasure, fair-haired Menelaus spoke to him: “Out upon them, for verily in the bed of a man of valiant heart were they fain to lie, who are themselves cravens.	αἱ δʼ ἴσαν ἐκ μεγάροιο δάος μετὰ χερσὶν ἔχουσαι, δέμνια δὲ στόρεσαν· ἐκ δὲ ξείνους ἄγε κῆρυξ. οἱ μὲν ἄρʼ ἐν προδόμῳ δόμου αὐτόθι κοιμήσαντο, Τηλέμαχός θʼ ἥρως καὶ Νέστορος ἀγλαὸς υἱός· Ἀτρεΐδης δὲ καθεῦδε μυχῷ δόμου ὑψηλοῖο,
Even as when in the thicket-lair of a mighty lion a hind has laid to sleep her new-born suckling fawns, and roams over the mountain slopes and grassy vales seeking pasture, and then the lion comes to his lair and upon the two lets loose a cruel doom,	πὰρ δʼ Ἑλένη τανύπεπλος ἐλέξατο, δῖα γυναικῶν. ἦμος δʼ ἠριγένεια φάνη ῥοδοδάκτυλος Ἠώς, ὤρνυτʼ ἄρʼ ἐξ εὐνῆφι βοὴν ἀγαθὸς Μενέλαος εἵματα ἑσσάμενος, περὶ δὲ ξίφος ὀξὺ θέτʼ ὤμῳ, ποσσὶ δʼ ὑπὸ λιπαροῖσιν ἐδήσατο καλὰ πέδιλα,
so will Odysseus let loose a cruel doom upon these men. I would, O father Zeus and Athena and Apollo, that in such strength as when once in fair-stablished Lesbos he rose up and wrestled a match with Philomeleides and threw him mightily, and all the Achaeans rejoiced,	βῆ δʼ ἴμεν ἐκ θαλάμοιο θεῷ ἐναλίγκιος ἄντην, Τηλεμάχῳ δὲ παρῖζεν, ἔπος τʼ ἔφατʼ ἔκ τʼ ὀνόμαζεν· τίπτε δέ σε χρειὼ δεῦρʼ ἤγαγε, Τηλέμαχʼ ἥρως, ἐς Λακεδαίμονα δῖαν, ἐπʼ εὐρέα νῶτα θαλάσσης; δήμιον ἦ ἴδιον; τόδε μοι νημερτὲς ἐνίσπες.
 even in such strength Odysseus might come among the wooers; then should they all find swift destruction and bitterness in their wooing. But in this matter of which thou dost ask and beseech me, verily I will not swerve aside to speak of other things, nor will I deceive thee; but of all that the unerring old man of the sea told me	τὸν δʼ αὖ Τηλέμαχος πεπνυμένος ἀντίον ηὔδα· Ἀτρεΐδη Μενέλαε διοτρεφές, ὄρχαμε λαῶν, ἤλυθον, εἴ τινά μοι κληηδόνα πατρὸς ἐνίσποις. ἐσθίεταί μοι οἶκος, ὄλωλε δὲ πίονα ἔργα, δυσμενέων δʼ ἀνδρῶν πλεῖος δόμος, οἵ τέ μοι αἰεὶ
not one thing will I hide from thee or conceal. “In Egypt , eager though I was to journey hither, the gods still held me back, because I offered not to them hecatombs that bring fulfillment, and the gods ever wished that men should be mindful of their commands. Now there is an island in the surging sea	μῆλʼ ἁδινὰ σφάζουσι καὶ εἰλίποδας ἕλικας βοῦς, μητρὸς ἐμῆς μνηστῆρες ὑπέρβιον ὕβριν ἔχοντες. τοὔνεκα νῦν τὰ σὰ γούναθʼ ἱκάνομαι, αἴ κʼ ἐθέλῃσθα κείνου λυγρὸν ὄλεθρον ἐνισπεῖν, εἴ που ὄπωπας ὀφθαλμοῖσι τεοῖσιν ἢ ἄλλου μῦθον ἄκουσας
in front of Egypt , and men call it Pharos, distant as far as a hollow ship runs in a whole day when the shrill wind blows fair behind her. Therein is a harbor with good anchorage, whence men launch the shapely ships into the sea, when they have drawn supplies of black water.	πλαζομένου· περὶ γάρ μιν ὀιζυρὸν τέκε μήτηρ. μηδέ τί μʼ αἰδόμενος μειλίσσεο μηδʼ ἐλεαίρων, ἀλλʼ εὖ μοι κατάλεξον ὅπως ἤντησας ὀπωπῆς. λίσσομαι, εἴ ποτέ τοί τι πατὴρ ἐμός, ἐσθλὸς Ὀδυσσεὺς ἢ ἔπος ἠέ τι ἔργον ὑποστὰς ἐξετέλεσσε
 There for twenty days the gods kept me, nor ever did the winds that blow over the deep spring up, which speed men's ships over the broad back of the sea. And now would all my stores have been spent and the strength of my men, had not one of the gods taken pity on me and saved me, even Eidothea,	δήμῳ ἔνι Τρώων, ὅθι πάσχετε πήματʼ Ἀχαιοί, τῶν νῦν μοι μνῆσαι, καί μοι νημερτὲς ἐνίσπες. τὸν δὲ μέγʼ ὀχθήσας προσέθη ξανθὸς Μενέλαος· ὢ πόποι, ἦ μάλα δὴ κρατερόφρονος ἀνδρὸς ἐν εὐνῇ ἤθελον εὐνηθῆναι ἀνάλκιδες αὐτοὶ ἐόντες.
 daughter of mighty Proteus, the old man of the sea; for her heart above all others had I moved. She met me as I wandered alone apart from my comrades, who were ever roaming about the island, fishing with bent hooks, for hunger pinched their bellies;	ὡς δʼ ὁπότʼ ἐν ξυλόχῳ ἔλαφος κρατεροῖο λέοντος νεβροὺς κοιμήσασα νεηγενέας γαλαθηνοὺς κνημοὺς ἐξερέῃσι καὶ ἄγκεα ποιήεντα βοσκομένη, ὁ δʼ ἔπειτα ἑὴν εἰσήλυθεν εὐνήν, ἀμφοτέροισι δὲ τοῖσιν ἀεικέα πότμον ἐφῆκεν,
and she came close to me, and spoke, and said: “‘Art thou so very foolish, stranger, and slack of wit, or art thou of thine own will remiss, and hast pleasure in suffering woes? So long art thou pent in the isle and canst find no sign of deliverance and the heart of thy comrades grows faint.’	ὣς Ὀδυσεὺς κείνοισιν ἀεικέα πότμον ἐφήσει. αἲ γάρ, Ζεῦ τε πάτερ καὶ Ἀθηναίη καὶ Ἄπολλον, τοῖος ἐών, οἷός ποτʼ ἐυκτιμένῃ ἐνὶ Λέσβῳ ἐξ ἔριδος Φιλομηλεΐδῃ ἐπάλαισεν ἀναστάς, κὰδ δʼ ἔβαλε κρατερῶς, κεχάροντο δὲ πάντες Ἀχαιοί,
 “So she spoke, and I made answer and said: ‘I will speak out and tell thee, whosoever among goddesses thou art, that in no wise am I pent here of mine own will, but it must be that I have sinned against the immortals, who hold broad heaven. But do thou tell me—for the gods know all things—	τοῖος ἐὼν μνηστῆρσιν ὁμιλήσειεν Ὀδυσσεύς· πάντες κʼ ὠκύμοροί τε γενοίατο πικρόγαμοί τε. ταῦτα δʼ ἅ μʼ εἰρωτᾷς καὶ λίσσεαι, οὐκ ἂν ἐγώ γε ἄλλα παρὲξ εἴποιμι παρακλιδόν, οὐδʼ ἀπατήσω, ἀλλὰ τὰ μέν μοι ἔειπε γέρων ἅλιος νημερτής,
who of the immortals fetters me here, and has hindered me from my path, and tell me of my return, how I may go over the teeming deep.’ “So I spoke, and the beautiful goddess straightway made answer: ‘Then verily, stranger, will I frankly tell thee all. There is wont to come hither the unerring old man of the sea,	τῶν οὐδέν τοι ἐγὼ κρύψω ἔπος οὐδʼ ἐπικεύσω. Αἰγύπτῳ μʼ ἔτι δεῦρο θεοὶ μεμαῶτα νέεσθαι ἔσχον, ἐπεὶ οὔ σφιν ἔρεξα τεληέσσας ἑκατόμβας. οἱ δʼ αἰεὶ βούλοντο θεοὶ μεμνῆσθαι ἐφετμέων. νῆσος ἔπειτά τις ἔστι πολυκλύστῳ ἐνὶ πόντῳ
 immortal Proteus of Egypt, who knows the depths of every sea, and is the servant of Poseidon. He, they say, is my father that begat me. If thou couldst in any wise lie in wait and catch him, he will tell thee thy way and the measure of thy path,	Αἰγύπτου προπάροιθε, Φάρον δέ ἑ κικλήσκουσι, τόσσον ἄνευθʼ ὅσσον τε πανημερίη γλαφυρὴ νηῦς ἤνυσεν, ᾗ λιγὺς οὖρος ἐπιπνείῃσιν ὄπισθεν· ἐν δὲ λιμὴν ἐύορμος, ὅθεν τʼ ἀπὸ νῆας ἐίσας ἐς πόντον βάλλουσιν, ἀφυσσάμενοι μέλαν ὕδωρ.
and of thy return, how thou mayest go over the teeming deep. Aye, and he will tell thee, thou fostered of Zeus, if so thou wilt, what evil and what good has been wrought in thy halls, while thou hast been gone on thy long and grievous way.’ “So she spoke, and I made answer and said:	ἔνθα μʼ ἐείκοσιν ἤματʼ ἔχον θεοί, οὐδέ ποτʼ οὖροι πνείοντες φαίνονθʼ ἁλιαέες, οἵ ῥά τε νηῶν πομπῆες γίγνονται ἐπʼ εὐρέα νῶτα θαλάσσης. καί νύ κεν ἤια πάντα κατέφθιτο καὶ μένεʼ ἀνδρῶν, εἰ μή τίς με θεῶν ὀλοφύρατο καί μʼ ἐσάωσε,
‘Do thou thyself now devise a means of lying in wait for the divine old man, lest haply he see me beforehand and being ware of my purpose avoid me. For hard is a god for a mortal man to master.’ “So I spoke, and the beautiful goddess straightway made answer: ‘Then verily, stranger, will I frankly tell thee all.	Πρωτέος ἰφθίμου θυγάτηρ ἁλίοιο γέροντος, Εἰδοθέη· τῇ γάρ ῥα μάλιστά γε θυμὸν ὄρινα. ἥ μʼ οἴῳ ἔρροντι συνήντετο νόσφιν ἑταίρων· αἰεὶ γὰρ περὶ νῆσον ἀλώμενοι ἰχθυάασκον γναμπτοῖς ἀγκίστροισιν, ἔτειρε δὲ γαστέρα λιμός.
 When the sun hath reached mid-heaven, the unerring old man of the sea is wont to come forth from the brine at the breath of the West Wind, hidden by the dark ripple. And when he is come forth, he lies down to sleep in the hollow caves; and around him the seals, the brood of the fair daughter of the sea,	ἡ δέ μευ ἄγχι στᾶσα ἔπος φάτο φώνησέν τε· νήπιός εἰς, ὦ ξεῖνε, λίην τόσον ἠδὲ χαλίφρων, ἦε ἑκὼν μεθίεις καὶ τέρπεαι ἄλγεα πάσχων; ὡς δὴ δήθʼ ἐνὶ νήσῳ ἐρύκεαι, οὐδέ τι τέκμωρ εὑρέμεναι δύνασαι, μινύθει δέ τοι ἦτορ ἑταίρων.
 sleep in a herd, coming forth from the gray water, and bitter is the smell they breathe of the depths of the sea. Thither will I lead thee at break of day and lay you all in a row; for do thou choose carefully three of thy companions, who are the best thou hast in thy well-benched ships.	ὣς ἔφατʼ, αὐτὰρ ἐγώ μιν ἀμειβόμενος προσέειπον· ἐκ μέν τοι ἐρέω, ἥ τις σύ πέρ ἐσσι θεάων, ὡς ἐγὼ οὔ τι ἑκὼν κατερύκομαι, ἀλλά νυ μέλλω ἀθανάτους ἀλιτέσθαι, οἳ οὐρανὸν εὐρὺν ἔχουσιν. ἀλλὰ σύ πέρ μοι εἰπέ, θεοὶ δέ τε πάντα ἴσασιν,
 And I will tell thee all the wizard wiles of that old man. First he will count the seals, and go over them; but when he has told them all off by fives, and beheld them, he will lay himself down in their midst, as a shepherd among his flocks of sheep. Now so soon as you see him laid to rest,	ὅς τίς μʼ ἀθανάτων πεδάᾳ καὶ ἔδησε κελεύθου, νόστον θʼ, ὡς ἐπὶ πόντον ἐλεύσομαι ἰχθυόεντα. ὣς ἐφάμην, ἡ δʼ αὐτίκʼ ἀμείβετο δῖα θεάων· τοιγὰρ ἐγώ τοι, ξεῖνε, μάλʼ ἀτρεκέως ἀγορεύσω. πωλεῖταί τις δεῦρο γέρων ἅλιος νημερτὴς
 thereafter let your hearts be filled with strength and courage, and do you hold him there despite his striving and struggling to escape. For try he will, and will assume all manner of shapes of all things that move upon the earth, and of water, and of wondrous blazing fire. Yet do ye hold him unflinchingly and grip him yet the more.	ἀθάνατος Πρωτεὺς Αἰγύπτιος, ὅς τε θαλάσσης πάσης βένθεα οἶδε, Ποσειδάωνος ὑποδμώς· τὸν δέ τʼ ἐμόν φασιν πατέρʼ ἔμμεναι ἠδὲ τεκέσθαι. τόν γʼ εἴ πως σὺ δύναιο λοχησάμενος λελαβέσθαι, ὅς κέν τοι εἴπῃσιν ὁδὸν καὶ μέτρα κελεύθου
But when at length of his own will he speaks and questions thee in that shape in which you saw him laid to rest, then, hero, stay thy might, and set the old man free, and ask him who of the gods is wroth with thee, and of thy return, how thou mayest go over the teeming deep.’	νόστον θʼ, ὡς ἐπὶ πόντον ἐλεύσεαι ἰχθυόεντα. καὶ δέ κέ τοι εἴπῃσι, διοτρεφές, αἴ κʼ ἐθέλῃσθα, ὅττι τοι ἐν μεγάροισι κακόν τʼ ἀγαθόν τε τέτυκται οἰχομένοιο σέθεν δολιχὴν ὁδὸν ἀργαλέην τε. ὣς ἔφατʼ, αὐτὰρ ἐγώ μιν ἀμειβόμενος προσέειπον·
 “So saying she plunged beneath the surging sea, but I went to my ships, where they stood on the sand, and many things did my heart darkly ponder as I went. But when I had come down to the ship and to the sea, and we had made ready our supper, and immortal night had come on,	αὐτὴ νῦν φράζευ σὺ λόχον θείοιο γέροντος, μή πώς με προϊδὼν ἠὲ προδαεὶς ἀλέηται· ἀργαλέος γάρ τʼ ἐστὶ θεὸς βροτῷ ἀνδρὶ δαμῆναι. ὣς ἐφάμην, ἡ δʼ αὐτίκʼ ἀμείβετο δῖα θεάων· τοιγὰρ ἐγώ τοι, ξεῖνε, μάλʼ ἀτρεκέως ἀγορεύσω.
then we lay down to rest on the shore of the sea. And as soon as early Dawn appeared, the rosy-fingered, I went along the shore of the broad-wayed sea, praying earnestly to the gods; and I took with me three of my comrades, in whom I trusted most for every adventure.	ἦμος δʼ ἠέλιος μέσον οὐρανὸν ἀμφιβεβήκῃ, τῆμος ἄρʼ ἐξ ἁλὸς εἶσι γέρων ἅλιος νημερτὴς πνοιῇ ὕπο Ζεφύροιο μελαίνῃ φρικὶ καλυφθείς, ἐκ δʼ ἐλθὼν κοιμᾶται ὑπὸ σπέσσι γλαφυροῖσιν· ἀμφὶ δέ μιν φῶκαι νέποδες καλῆς ἁλοσύδνης
 “She meanwhile had plunged beneath the broad bosom of the sea, and had brought forth from the deep the skins of four seals, and all were newly flayed; and she devised a plot against her father. She had scooped out lairs in the sand of the sea, and sat waiting; and we came very near to her,	ἁθρόαι εὕδουσιν, πολιῆς ἁλὸς ἐξαναδῦσαι, πικρὸν ἀποπνείουσαι ἁλὸς πολυβενθέος ὀδμήν. ἔνθα σʼ ἐγὼν ἀγαγοῦσα ἅμʼ ἠοῖ φαινομένηφιν εὐνάσω ἑξείης· σὺ δʼ ἐὺ κρίνασθαι ἑταίρους τρεῖς, οἵ τοι παρὰ νηυσὶν ἐυσσέλμοισιν ἄριστοι.
 and she made us to lie down in a row, and cast a skin over each. Then would our ambush have proved most terrible, for terribly did the deadly stench of the brine-bred seals distress us—who would lay him down by a beast of the sea?—but she of herself delivered us, and devised a great boon;	πάντα δέ τοι ἐρέω ὀλοφώια τοῖο γέροντος. φώκας μέν τοι πρῶτον ἀριθμήσει καὶ ἔπεισιν· αὐτὰρ ἐπὴν πάσας πεμπάσσεται ἠδὲ ἴδηται, λέξεται ἐν μέσσῃσι νομεὺς ὣς πώεσι μήλων. τὸν μὲν ἐπὴν δὴ πρῶτα κατευνηθέντα ἴδησθε,
 she brought and placed ambrosia of a very sweet fragrance beneath each man's nose, and destroyed the stench of the beast. So all the morning we waited with steadfast heart, and the seals came forth from the sea in throngs. These then laid them down in rows along the shore of the sea,	καὶ τότʼ ἔπειθʼ ὑμῖν μελέτω κάρτος τε βίη τε, αὖθι δʼ ἔχειν μεμαῶτα καὶ ἐσσύμενόν περ ἀλύξαι. πάντα δὲ γιγνόμενος πειρήσεται, ὅσσʼ ἐπὶ γαῖαν ἑρπετὰ γίγνονται, καὶ ὕδωρ καὶ θεσπιδαὲς πῦρ· ὑμεῖς δʼ ἀστεμφέως ἐχέμεν μᾶλλόν τε πιέζειν.
 and at noon the old man came forth from the sea and found the fatted seals; and he went over all, and counted their number. Among the creatures he counted us first, nor did his heart guess that there was guile; and then he too laid him down. Thereat we rushed upon him with a shout, and	ἀλλʼ ὅτε κεν δή σʼ αὐτὸς ἀνείρηται ἐπέεσσι, τοῖος ἐὼν οἷόν κε κατευνηθέντα ἴδησθε, καὶ τότε δὴ σχέσθαι τε βίης λῦσαί τε γέροντα, ἥρως, εἴρεσθαι δέ, θεῶν ὅς τίς σε χαλέπτει, νόστον θʼ, ὡς ἐπὶ πόντον ἐλεύσεαι ἰχθυόεντα.
 threw our arms about him, nor did that old man forget his crafty wiles. Nay, at the first he turned into a bearded lion, and then into a serpent, and a leopard, and a huge boar; then he turned into flowing water, and into a tree, high and leafy; but we held on unflinchingly with steadfast heart.	ὣς εἰποῦσʼ ὑπὸ πόντον ἐδύσετο κυμαίνοντα. αὐτὰρ ἐγὼν ἐπὶ νῆας, ὅθʼ ἕστασαν ἐν ψαμάθοισιν, ἤια· πολλὰ δέ μοι κραδίη πόρφυρε κιόντι. αὐτὰρ ἐπεί ῥʼ ἐπὶ νῆα κατήλυθον ἠδὲ θάλασσαν, δόρπον θʼ ὁπλισάμεσθʼ, ἐπί τʼ ἤλυθεν ἀμβροσίη νύξ·
But when at last that old man, skilled in wizard arts, grew weary, then he questioned me, and spoke, and said: “‘Who of the gods, son of Atreus, took counsel with thee that thou mightest lie in wait for me, and take me against my will? Of what hast thou need?’ “So he spoke, and I made answer, and said:	δὴ τότε κοιμήθημεν ἐπὶ ῥηγμῖνι θαλάσσης. ἦμος δʼ ἠριγένεια φάνη ῥοδοδάκτυλος Ἠώς, καὶ τότε δὴ παρὰ θῖνα θαλάσσης εὐρυπόροιο ἤια πολλὰ θεοὺς γουνούμενος· αὐτὰρ ἑταίρους τρεῖς ἄγον, οἷσι μάλιστα πεποίθεα πᾶσαν ἐπʼ ἰθύν.
 ‘Thou knowest, old man—why dost thou seek to put me off with this question?—how long a time I am pent in this isle, and can find no sign of deliverance, and my heart grows faint within me. But do thou tell me—for the gods know all things—who of the immortals fetters me here, and has hindered me from my path, and tell me	τόφρα δʼ ἄρʼ ἥ γʼ ὑποδῦσα θαλάσσης εὐρέα κόλπον τέσσαρα φωκάων ἐκ πόντου δέρματʼ ἔνεικε· πάντα δʼ ἔσαν νεόδαρτα· δόλον δʼ ἐπεμήδετο πατρί. εὐνὰς δʼ ἐν ψαμάθοισι διαγλάψασʼ ἁλίῃσιν ἧστο μένουσʼ· ἡμεῖς δὲ μάλα σχεδὸν ἤλθομεν αὐτῆς·
of my return, how I may go over the teeming deep.’ “So I spoke, and he straightway made answer, and said: ‘Nay, surely thou oughtest to have made fair offerings to Zeus and the other gods before embarking, that with greatest speed thou mightest have come to thy country, sailing over the wine-dark sea.	ἑξείης δʼ εὔνησε, βάλεν δʼ ἐπὶ δέρμα ἑκάστῳ. ἔνθα κεν αἰνότατος λόχος ἔπλετο· τεῖρε γὰρ αἰνῶς φωκάων ἁλιοτρεφέων ὀλοώτατος ὀδμή· τίς γάρ κʼ εἰναλίῳ παρὰ κήτεϊ κοιμηθείη; ἀλλʼ αὐτὴ ἐσάωσε καὶ ἐφράσατο μέγʼ ὄνειαρ·
For it is not thy fate to see thy friends, and reach thy well-built house and thy native land, before that thou hast once more gone to the waters of Aegyptus , the heaven-fed river, and hast offered holy hecatombs to the immortal gods who hold broad heaven.	ἀμβροσίην ὑπὸ ῥῖνα ἑκάστῳ θῆκε φέρουσα ἡδὺ μάλα πνείουσαν, ὄλεσσε δὲ κήτεος ὀδμήν. πᾶσαν δʼ ἠοίην μένομεν τετληότι θυμῷ· φῶκαι δʼ ἐξ ἁλὸς ἦλθον ἀολλέες. αἱ μὲν ἔπειτα ἑξῆς εὐνάζοντο παρὰ ῥηγμῖνι θαλάσσης·
Then at length shall the gods grant thee the journey thou desirest.’ “So he spoke, and my spirit was broken within me, for that he bade me go again over the misty deep to Aegyptus , a long and weary way. Yet even so I made answer, and said:	ἔνδιος δʼ ὁ γέρων ἦλθʼ ἐξ ἁλός, εὗρε δὲ φώκας ζατρεφέας, πάσας δʼ ἄρʼ ἐπῴχετο, λέκτο δʼ ἀριθμόν· ἐν δʼ ἡμέας πρώτους λέγε κήτεσιν, οὐδέ τι θυμῷ ὠΐσθη δόλον εἶναι· ἔπειτα δὲ λέκτο καὶ αὐτός. ἡμεῖς δὲ ἰάχοντες ἐπεσσύμεθʼ, ἀμφὶ δὲ χεῖρας
“‘All this will I perform, old man, even as thou dost bid. But come now, tell me this, and declare it truly. Did all the Achaeans return unscathed in their ships, all those whom Nestor and I left, as we set out from Troy ? Or did any perish by a cruel death on board his ship,	βάλλομεν· οὐδʼ ὁ γέρων δολίης ἐπελήθετο τέχνης, ἀλλʼ ἦ τοι πρώτιστα λέων γένετʼ ἠυγένειος, αὐτὰρ ἔπειτα δράκων καὶ πάρδαλις ἠδὲ μέγας σῦς· γίγνετο δʼ ὑγρὸν ὕδωρ καὶ δένδρεον ὑψιπέτηλον· ἡμεῖς δʼ ἀστεμφέως ἔχομεν τετληότι θυμῷ.
or in the arms of his friends, when he had wound up the skein of war?’ “So I spoke, and he straightway made answer, and said: ‘Son of Atreus, why dost thou question me of this? In no wise does it behove thee to know, or to learn my mind; nor, methinks, wilt thou long be free from tears, when thou hast heard all aright.	ἀλλʼ ὅτε δή ῥʼ ἀνίαζʼ ὁ γέρων ὀλοφώια εἰδώς, καὶ τότε δή μʼ ἐπέεσσιν ἀνειρόμενος προσέειπε· τίς νύ τοι, Ἀτρέος υἱέ, θεῶν συμφράσσατο βουλάς, ὄφρα μʼ ἕλοις ἀέκοντα λοχησάμενος; τέο σε χρή; ὣς ἔφατʼ, αὐτὰρ ἐγώ μιν ἀμειβόμενος προσέειπον·
For many of them were slain, and many were left; but two chieftains alone of the brazen-coated Achaeans perished on their homeward way ( as for the fighting, thou thyself wast there), and one, I ween, still lives, and is held back on the broad deep. “‘Aias truly was lost amid his long-oared ships.	οἶσθα, γέρον, τί με ταῦτα παρατροπέων ἐρεείνεις; ὡς δὴ δήθʼ ἐνὶ νήσῳ ἐρύκομαι, οὐδέ τι τέκμωρ εὑρέμεναι δύναμαι, μινύθει δέ μοι ἔνδοθεν ἦτορ. ἀλλὰ σύ πέρ μοι εἰπέ, θεοὶ δέ τε πάντα ἴσασιν, ὅς τίς μʼ ἀθανάτων πεδάᾳ καὶ ἔδησε κελεύθου,
 Upon the great rocks of Gyrae Poseidon at first drove him, but saved him from the sea; and he would have escaped his doom, hated of Athena though he was, had he not uttered a boastful word in great blindness of heart. He declared that it was in spite of the gods that he had escaped the great gulf of the sea;	νόστον θʼ, ὡς ἐπὶ πόντον ἐλεύσομαι ἰχθυόεντα. ὣς ἐφάμην, ὁ δέ μʼ αὐτίκʼ ἀμειβόμενος προσέειπεν· ἀλλὰ μάλʼ ὤφελλες Διί τʼ ἄλλοισίν τε θεοῖσι ῥέξας ἱερὰ κάλʼ ἀναβαινέμεν, ὄφρα τάχιστα σὴν ἐς πατρίδʼ ἵκοιο πλέων ἐπὶ οἴνοπα πόντον.
 and Poseidon heard his boastful speech, and straightway took his trident in his mighty hands, and smote the rock of Gyrae and clove it in sunder. And one part abode in its place, but the sundered part fell into the sea, even that on which Aias sat at the first when his heart was greatly blinded,	οὐ γάρ τοι πρὶν μοῖρα φίλους τʼ ἰδέειν καὶ ἱκέσθαι οἶκον ἐυκτίμενον καὶ σὴν ἐς πατρίδα γαῖαν, πρίν γʼ ὅτʼ ἂν Αἰγύπτοιο, διιπετέος ποταμοῖο, αὖτις ὕδωρ ἔλθῃς ῥέξῃς θʼ ἱερὰς ἑκατόμβας ἀθανάτοισι θεοῖσι, τοὶ οὐρανὸν εὐρὺν ἔχουσι·
and it bore him down into the boundless surging deep. So there he perished, when he had drunk the salt water. “‘But thy brother escaped, indeed, the fates and shunned them with his hollow ships, for queenly Hera saved him. But when he was now about	καὶ τότε τοι δώσουσιν ὁδὸν θεοί, ἣν σὺ μενοινᾷς. ὣς ἔφατʼ, αὐτὰρ ἐμοί γε κατεκλάσθη φίλον ἦτορ, οὕνεκά μʼ αὖτις ἄνωγεν ἐπʼ ἠεροειδέα πόντον Αἴγυπτόνδʼ ἰέναι, δολιχὴν ὁδὸν ἀργαλέην τε. ἀλλὰ καὶ ὣς μύθοισιν ἀμειβόμενος προσέειπον·
to reach the steep height of Malea, then the storm-wind caught him up and bore him over the teeming deep, groaning heavily, to the border of the land, where aforetime Thyestes dwelt, but where now dwelt Thyestes' son Aegisthus. But when from hence too a safe return was shewed him,	ταῦτα μὲν οὕτω δὴ τελέω, γέρον, ὡς σὺ κελεύεις. ἀλλʼ ἄγε μοι τόδε εἰπὲ καὶ ἀτρεκέως κατάλεξον, ἢ πάντες σὺν νηυσὶν ἀπήμονες ἦλθον Ἀχαιοί, οὓς Νέστωρ καὶ ἐγὼ λίπομεν Τροίηθεν ἰόντες, ἦέ τις ὤλετʼ ὀλέθρῳ ἀδευκέι ἧς ἐπὶ νηὸς
 and the gods changed the course of the wind that it blew fair, and they reached home, then verily with rejoicing did Agamemnon set foot on his native land, and he clasped his land and kissed it, and many were the hot tears that streamed from his eyes, for welcome to him was the sight of his land. Now from his place of watch a watchman saw him, whom	ἠὲ φίλων ἐν χερσίν, ἐπεὶ πόλεμον τολύπευσεν. ὣς ἐφάμην, ὁ δέ μʼ αὐτίκʼ ἀμειβόμενος προσέειπεν· Ἀτρεΐδη, τί με ταῦτα διείρεαι; οὐδέ τί σε χρὴ ἴδμεναι, οὐδὲ δαῆναι ἐμὸν νόον· οὐδέ σέ φημι δὴν ἄκλαυτον ἔσεσθαι, ἐπὴν ἐὺ πάντα πύθηαι.
 guileful Aegisthus took and set there, promising him as a reward two talents of gold; and he had been keeping guard for a year, lest Agamemnon should pass by him unseen, and be mindful of his furious might. So he went to the palace to bear the tidings to the shepherd of the people, and Aegisthus straightway planned a treacherous device.	πολλοὶ μὲν γὰρ τῶν γε δάμεν, πολλοὶ δὲ λίποντο· ἀρχοὶ δʼ αὖ δύο μοῦνοι Ἀχαιῶν χαλκοχιτώνων ἐν νόστῳ ἀπόλοντο· μάχῃ δέ τε καὶ σὺ παρῆσθα. εἷς δʼ ἔτι που ζωὸς κατερύκεται εὐρέι πόντῳ. Αἴας μὲν μετὰ νηυσὶ δάμη δολιχηρέτμοισι.
 He chose out twenty men, the best in the land, and set them to lie in wait, but on the further side of the hall he bade prepare a feast. Then he went with chariot and horses to summon Agamemnon, shepherd of the people, his mind pondering a dastardly deed. So he brought him up all unaware of his doom,	Γυρῇσίν μιν πρῶτα Ποσειδάων ἐπέλασσεν πέτρῃσιν μεγάλῃσι καὶ ἐξεσάωσε θαλάσσης· καί νύ κεν ἔκφυγε κῆρα καὶ ἐχθόμενός περ Ἀθήνῃ, εἰ μὴ ὑπερφίαλον ἔπος ἔκβαλε καὶ μέγʼ ἀάσθη· φῆ ῥʼ ἀέκητι θεῶν φυγέειν μέγα λαῖτμα θαλάσσης.
and when he had feasted him he slew him, as one slays an ox at the stall. And not one of the comrades of the son of Atreus was left, of all that followed him, nor one of the men of Aegisthus, but they were all slain in the halls.’ “So he spoke, and my spirit was broken within me, and I wept, as I sat on the sands, nor had my heart	τοῦ δὲ Ποσειδάων μεγάλʼ ἔκλυεν αὐδήσαντος· αὐτίκʼ ἔπειτα τρίαιναν ἑλὼν χερσὶ στιβαρῇσιν ἤλασε Γυραίην πέτρην, ἀπὸ δʼ ἔσχισεν αὐτήν· καὶ τὸ μὲν αὐτόθι μεῖνε, τὸ δὲ τρύφος ἔμπεσε πόντῳ, τῷ ῥʼ Αἴας τὸ πρῶτον ἐφεζόμενος μέγʼ ἀάσθη·
any longer desire to live and to behold the light of the sun. But when I had had my fill of weeping and writhing, then the unerring old man of the sea said to me: “‘No more, son of Atreus, do thou weep long time thus without ceasing, for in it we shall find no help. Nay, rather, with all the speed thou canst,	τὸν δʼ ἐφόρει κατὰ πόντον ἀπείρονα κυμαίνοντα. ὣς ὁ μὲν ἔνθʼ ἀπόλωλεν, ἐπεὶ πίεν ἁλμυρὸν ὕδωρ. σὸς δέ που ἔκφυγε κῆρας ἀδελφεὸς ἠδʼ ὑπάλυξεν ἐν νηυσὶ γλαφυρῇσι· σάωσε δὲ πότνια Ἥρη. ἀλλʼ ὅτε δὴ τάχʼ ἔμελλε Μαλειάων ὄρος αἰπὺ
strive that thou mayest come to thy native land, for either thou wilt find Aegisthus alive, or haply Orestes may have forestalled thee and slain him, and thou mayest chance upon his funeral feast.’ “So he spoke, and my heart and spirit were again warmed with comfort in my breast despite my grief,	ἵξεσθαι, τότε δή μιν ἀναρπάξασα θύελλα πόντον ἐπʼ ἰχθυόεντα φέρεν βαρέα στενάχοντα, ἀγροῦ ἐπʼ ἐσχατιήν, ὅθι δώματα ναῖε Θυέστης τὸ πρίν, ἀτὰρ τότʼ ἔναιε Θυεστιάδης Αἴγισθος. ἀλλʼ ὅτε δὴ καὶ κεῖθεν ἐφαίνετο νόστος ἀπήμων,
and I spoke, and addressed him with winged words: “‘Of these men now I know, but do thou name the third, who he is that still lives, and is held back upon the broad sea, or is haply dead. Fain would I hear, despite my grief.’ “So I spoke, and he straightway made answer, and said:	ἂψ δὲ θεοὶ οὖρον στρέψαν, καὶ οἴκαδʼ ἵκοντο, ἦ τοι ὁ μὲν χαίρων ἐπεβήσετο πατρίδος αἴης καὶ κύνει ἁπτόμενος ἣν πατρίδα· πολλὰ δʼ ἀπʼ αὐτοῦ δάκρυα θερμὰ χέοντʼ, ἐπεὶ ἀσπασίως ἴδε γαῖαν. τὸν δʼ ἄρʼ ἀπὸ σκοπιῆς εἶδε σκοπός, ὅν ῥα καθεῖσεν
‘It is the son of Laertes, whose home is in Ithaca . Him I saw in an island, shedding big tears, in the halls of the nymph Calypso, who keeps him there perforce, and he cannot come to his native land, for he has at hand no ships with oars and no comrades	Αἴγισθος δολόμητις ἄγων, ὑπὸ δʼ ἔσχετο μισθὸν χρυσοῦ δοιὰ τάλαντα· φύλασσε δʼ ὅ γʼ εἰς ἐνιαυτόν, μή ἑ λάθοι παριών, μνήσαιτο δὲ θούριδος ἀλκῆς. βῆ δʼ ἴμεν ἀγγελέων πρὸς δώματα ποιμένι λαῶν. αὐτίκα δʼ Αἴγισθος δολίην ἐφράσσατο τέχνην·
to send him on his way over the broad back of the sea. But for thyself, Menelaus, fostered of Zeus, it is not ordained that thou shouldst die and meet thy fate in horse-pasturing Argos , but to the Elysian plain and the bounds of the earth will the immortals convey thee, where dwells fair-haired Rhadamanthus,	κρινάμενος κατὰ δῆμον ἐείκοσι φῶτας ἀρίστους εἷσε λόχον, ἑτέρωθι δʼ ἀνώγει δαῖτα πένεσθαι. αὐτὰρ ὁ βῆ καλέων Ἀγαμέμνονα, ποιμένα λαῶν ἵπποισιν καὶ ὄχεσφιν, ἀεικέα μερμηρίζων. τὸν δʼ οὐκ εἰδότʼ ὄλεθρον ἀνήγαγε καὶ κατέπεφνεν
and where life is easiest for men. No snow is there, nor heavy storm, nor ever rain, but ever does Ocean send up blasts of the shrill-blowing West Wind that they may give cooling to men; for thou hast Helen to wife, and art in their eyes the husband of the daughter of Zeus.’	δειπνίσσας, ὥς τίς τε κατέκτανε βοῦν ἐπὶ φάτνῃ. οὐδέ τις Ἀτρεΐδεω ἑτάρων λίπεθʼ οἵ οἱ ἕποντο, οὐδέ τις Αἰγίσθου, ἀλλʼ ἔκταθεν ἐν μεγάροισιν. ὣς ἔφατʼ, αὐτὰρ ἐμοί γε κατεκλάσθη φίλον ἦτορ, κλαῖον δʼ ἐν ψαμάθοισι καθήμενος, οὐδέ νύ μοι κῆρ
 “So saying he plunged beneath the surging sea, but I went to my ships with my god like comrades, and many things did my heart darkly ponder as I went. But when I had come down to the ship and to the sea, and we had made ready our supper, and immortal night had come on,	ἤθελʼ ἔτι ζώειν καὶ ὁρᾶν φάος ἠελίοιο. αὐτὰρ ἐπεὶ κλαίων τε κυλινδόμενός τε κορέσθην, δὴ τότε με προσέειπε γέρων ἅλιος νημερτής· μηκέτι, Ἀτρέος υἱέ, πολὺν χρόνον ἀσκελὲς οὕτω κλαῖʼ, ἐπεὶ οὐκ ἄνυσίν τινα δήομεν· ἀλλὰ τάχιστα
 then we lay down to rest on the shore of the sea. And as soon as early Dawn appeared, the rosy-fingered, our ships first of all we drew down to the bright sea, and set the masts and the sails in the shapely ships, and the men, too, went on board and sat down upon the benches,	πείρα ὅπως κεν δὴ σὴν πατρίδα γαῖαν ἵκηαι. ἢ γάρ μιν ζωόν γε κιχήσεαι, ἤ κεν Ὀρέστης κτεῖνεν ὑποφθάμενος, σὺ δέ κεν τάφου ἀντιβολήσαις. ὣς ἔφατʼ, αὐτὰρ ἐμοὶ κραδίη καὶ θυμὸς ἀγήνωρ αὖτις ἐνὶ στήθεσσι καὶ ἀχνυμένῳ περ ἰάνθη,
and sitting well in order smote the grey sea with their oars. So back again to the waters of Aegyptus , the heaven-fed river, I sailed, and there moored my ships and offered hecatombs that bring fulfillment. But when I had stayed the wrath of the gods that are forever, I heaped up a mound to Agamemnon, that his fame might be unquenchable.	καί μιν φωνήσας ἔπεα πτερόεντα προσηύδων· τούτους μὲν δὴ οἶδα· σὺ δὲ τρίτον ἄνδρʼ ὀνόμαζε, ὅς τις ἔτι ζωὸς κατερύκεται εὐρέι πόντῳ ἠὲ θανών· ἐθέλω δὲ καὶ ἀχνύμενός περ ἀκοῦσαι. ὣς ἐφάμην, ὁ δέ μʼ αὐτίκʼ ἀμειβόμενος προσέειπεν·
 Then, when I had made an end of this, I set out for home, and the immortals gave me a fair wind, and brought me swiftly to my dear native land. But come now, tarry in my halls until the eleventh or the twelfth day be come. Then will I send thee forth with honor and give thee splendid gifts,	υἱὸς Λαέρτεω, Ἰθάκῃ ἔνι οἰκία ναίων· τὸν δʼ ἴδον ἐν νήσῳ θαλερὸν κατὰ δάκρυ χέοντα, νύμφης ἐν μεγάροισι Καλυψοῦς, ἥ μιν ἀνάγκῃ ἴσχει· ὁ δʼ οὐ δύναται ἣν πατρίδα γαῖαν ἱκέσθαι· οὐ γάρ οἱ πάρα νῆες ἐπήρετμοι καὶ ἑταῖροι,
three horses and a well-polished car; and besides I will give thee a beautiful cup, that thou mayest pour libations to the immortal gods, and remember me all thy days.” Then wise Telemachus answered him: “Son of Atreus, keep me no long time here,	οἵ κέν μιν πέμποιεν ἐπʼ εὐρέα νῶτα θαλάσσης. σοὶ δʼ οὐ θέσφατόν ἐστι, διοτρεφὲς ὦ Μενέλαε, Ἄργει ἐν ἱπποβότῳ θανέειν καὶ πότμον ἐπισπεῖν, ἀλλά σʼ ἐς Ἠλύσιον πεδίον καὶ πείρατα γαίης ἀθάνατοι πέμψουσιν, ὅθι ξανθὸς Ῥαδάμανθυς,
for verily for a year would I be content to sit in thy house, nor would desire for home or parents come upon me; for wondrous is the pleasure I take in listening to thy tales and thy speech. But even now my comrades are chafing in sacred Pylos , and thou art keeping me long time here.	τῇ περ ῥηίστη βιοτὴ πέλει ἀνθρώποισιν· οὐ νιφετός, οὔτʼ ἂρ χειμὼν πολὺς οὔτε ποτʼ ὄμβρος, ἀλλʼ αἰεὶ Ζεφύροιο λιγὺ πνείοντος ἀήτας Ὠκεανὸς ἀνίησιν ἀναψύχειν ἀνθρώπους· οὕνεκʼ ἔχεις Ἑλένην καί σφιν γαμβρὸς Διός ἐσσι.
And whatsoever gift thou wouldest give me, let it be some treasure; but horses will I not take to Ithaca , but will leave them here for thyself to delight in, for thou art lord of a wide plain, wherein is lotus in abundance, and galingale and wheat and spelt, and broad-eared white barley.	ὣς εἰπὼν ὑπὸ πόντον ἐδύσετο κυμαίνοντα. αὐτὰρ ἐγὼν ἐπὶ νῆας ἅμʼ ἀντιθέοις ἑτάροισιν ἤια, πολλὰ δέ μοι κραδίη πόρφυρε κιόντι. αὐτὰρ ἐπεί ῥʼ ἐπὶ νῆα κατήλθομεν ἠδὲ θάλασσαν, δόρπον θʼ ὁπλισάμεσθʼ, ἐπί τʼ ἤλυθεν ἀμβροσίη νύξ,
But in Ithaca there are no widespread courses nor aught of meadow-land. It is a pasture-land of goats and pleasanter than one that pastures horses. For not one of the islands that lean upon the sea is fit for driving horses, or rich in meadows, and Ithaca least of all.” So he spoke, and Menelaus, good at the war-cry, smiled,	δὴ τότε κοιμήθημεν ἐπὶ ῥηγμῖνι θαλάσσης. ἦμος δʼ ἠριγένεια φάνη ῥοδοδάκτυλος Ἠώς, νῆας μὲν πάμπρωτον ἐρύσσαμεν εἰς ἅλα δῖαν, ἐν δʼ ἱστοὺς τιθέμεσθα καὶ ἱστία νηυσὶν ἐίσῃς, ἂν δὲ καὶ αὐτοὶ βάντες ἐπὶ κληῖσι καθῖζον·
and stroked him with his hand, and spoke, and addressed him: “Thou art of noble blood, dear child, that thou speakest thus. Therefore will I change these gifts, for well I may. Of all the gifts that lie stored as treasures in my house, I will give thee that one which is fairest and costliest.	ἑξῆς δʼ ἑζόμενοι πολιὴν ἅλα τύπτον ἐρετμοῖς. ἂψ δʼ εἰς Αἰγύπτοιο διιπετέος ποταμοῖο στῆσα νέας, καὶ ἔρεξα τεληέσσας ἑκατόμβας. αὐτὰρ ἐπεὶ κατέπαυσα θεῶν χόλον αἰὲν ἐόντων, χεῦʼ Ἀγαμέμνονι τύμβον, ἵνʼ ἄσβεστον κλέος εἴη.
I will give thee a well-wrought mixing bowl. All of silver it is, and with gold are the rims thereof gilded, the work of Hephaestus; and the warrior Phaedimus, king of the Sidonians, gave it me, when his house sheltered me as I came thither, and now I am minded to give it to thee.”	ταῦτα τελευτήσας νεόμην, ἔδοσαν δέ μοι οὖρον ἀθάνατοι, τοί μʼ ὦκα φίλην ἐς πατρίδʼ ἔπεμψαν. ἀλλʼ ἄγε νῦν ἐπίμεινον ἐνὶ μεγάροισιν ἐμοῖσιν, ὄφρα κεν ἑνδεκάτη τε δυωδεκάτη τε γένηται· καὶ τότε σʼ εὖ πέμψω, δώσω δέ τοι ἀγλαὰ δῶρα,
Thus they spoke to one another, and meanwhile the banqueters came to the palace of the divine king. They drove up sheep, and brought strengthening wine, and their wives with beautiful veils sent them bread. Thus they were busied about the feast in the halls.	τρεῖς ἵππους καὶ δίφρον ἐύξοον· αὐτὰρ ἔπειτα δώσω καλὸν ἄλεισον, ἵνα σπένδῃσθα θεοῖσιν ἀθανάτοις ἐμέθεν μεμνημένος ἤματα πάντα. τὸν δʼ αὖ Τηλέμαχος πεπνυμένος ἀντίον ηὔδα· Ἀτρεΐδη, μὴ δή με πολὺν χρόνον ἐνθάδʼ ἔρυκε.
 But the wooers in front of the palace of Odysseus were making merry, throwing the discus and the javelin in a levelled place, as their wont was, in insolence of heart; and Antinous and godlike Eurymachus were sitting there, the leaders of the wooers, who in valiance were far the best of all.	καὶ γάρ κʼ εἰς ἐνιαυτὸν ἐγὼ παρὰ σοί γʼ ἀνεχοίμην ἥμενος, οὐδέ κέ μʼ οἴκου ἕλοι πόθος οὐδὲ τοκήων· αἰνῶς γὰρ μύθοισιν ἔπεσσί τε σοῖσιν ἀκούων τέρπομαι. ἀλλʼ ἤδη μοι ἀνιάζουσιν ἑταῖροι ἐν Πύλῳ ἠγαθέῃ· σὺ δέ με χρόνον ἐνθάδʼ ἐρύκεις.
To them Noemon, son of Phronius, drew near, and he questioned Antinous, and spoke, and said: “Antinous, know we at all in our hearts, or know we not, when Telemachus will return from sandy Pylos ? He is gone, taking a ship of mine, and I have need of her	δῶρον δʼ ὅττι κέ μοι δοίης, κειμήλιον ἔστω· ἵππους δʼ εἰς Ἰθάκην οὐκ ἄξομαι, ἀλλὰ σοὶ αὐτῷ ἐνθάδε λείψω ἄγαλμα· σὺ γὰρ πεδίοιο ἀνάσσεις εὐρέος, ᾧ ἔνι μὲν λωτὸς πολύς, ἐν δὲ κύπειρον πυροί τε ζειαί τε ἰδʼ εὐρυφυὲς κρῖ λευκόν.
to cross over to spacious Elis , where I have twelve brood mares, and at the teat sturdy mules as yet unbroken. Of these I would fain drive one off and break him in.” So he spoke, and they marvelled at heart, for they did not deem that Telemachus had gone to Neleian Pylos, but that he was somewhere there	ἐν δʼ Ἰθάκῃ οὔτʼ ἂρ δρόμοι εὐρέες οὔτε τι λειμών· αἰγίβοτος, καὶ μᾶλλον ἐπήρατος ἱπποβότοιο. οὐ γάρ τις νήσων ἱππήλατος οὐδʼ ἐυλείμων, αἵ θʼ ἁλὶ κεκλίαται· Ἰθάκη δέ τε καὶ περὶ πασέων. ὣς φάτο, μείδησεν δὲ βοὴν ἀγαθὸς Μενέλαος,
on his lands, among the flocks or with the swineherd. Then Antinous, son of Eupeithes, spoke to him, saying: “Tell me the truth; when did he go, and what youths went with him? Were they chosen youths of Ithaca , or hirelings and slaves of his own? Able would he be to accomplish even that.	χειρί τέ μιν κατέρεξεν ἔπος τʼ ἔφατʼ ἔκ τʼ ὀνόμαζεν· αἵματός εἰς ἀγαθοῖο, φίλον τέκος, οἷʼ ἀγορεύεις· τοιγὰρ ἐγώ τοι ταῦτα μεταστήσω· δύναμαι γάρ. δώρων δʼ ὅσσʼ ἐν ἐμῷ οἴκῳ κειμήλια κεῖται, δώσω ὃ κάλλιστον καὶ τιμηέστατόν ἐστιν·
And tell me this truly, that I may know full well. Was it perforce and against thy will that he took from thee the black ship? or didst thou give it him freely of thine own will, because he besought thee?” Then Noemon, son of Phronius, answered him:“I myself freely gave it him. What else could any man do,	δώσω τοι κρητῆρα τετυγμένον· ἀργύρεος δὲ ἔστιν ἅπας, χρυσῷ δʼ ἐπὶ χείλεα κεκράανται, ἔργον δʼ Ἡφαίστοιο. πόρεν δέ ἑ Φαίδιμος ἥρως, Σιδονίων βασιλεύς, ὅθʼ ἑὸς δόμος ἀμφεκάλυψε κεῖσέ με νοστήσαντα· τεῒν δʼ ἐθέλω τόδʼ ὀπάσσαι.
 when a man like him, his heart laden with care, makes entreaty? Hard it were to deny the gift. The youths that are the noblest in the land after ourselves, even these have gone with him; and among them I noted one going on board as their leader, Mentor, or a god, who was in all things like unto Mentor.	ὣς οἱ μὲν τοιαῦτα πρὸς ἀλλήλους ἀγόρευον, δαιτυμόνες δʼ ἐς δώματʼ ἴσαν θείου βασιλῆος. οἱ δʼ ἦγον μὲν μῆλα, φέρον δʼ ἐυήνορα οἶνον· σῖτον δέ σφʼ ἄλοχοι καλλικρήδεμνοι ἔπεμπον. ὣς οἱ μὲν περὶ δεῖπνον ἐνὶ μεγάροισι πένοντο.
and among them spoke Antinous, son of Eupeithes, in displeasure; and with rage was his black heart wholly filled, and his eyes were like blazing fire. “Out upon him, verily a proud deed has been insolently brought to pass by Telemachus, even this journey, and we deemed that he would never see it accomplished.	μνηστῆρες δὲ πάροιθεν Ὀδυσσῆος μεγάροιο δίσκοισιν τέρποντο καὶ αἰγανέῃσιν ἱέντες ἐν τυκτῷ δαπέδῳ, ὅθι περ πάρος, ὕβριν ἔχοντες. Ἀντίνοος δὲ καθῆστο καὶ Εὐρύμαχος θεοειδής, ἀρχοὶ μνηστήρων, ἀρετῇ δʼ ἔσαν ἔξοχʼ ἄριστοι.
 Forth in despite of all of us here the lad is gone without more ado, launching a ship, and choosing the best men in the land. He will begin by and by to be our bane; but to his own undoing may Zeus destroy his might before ever he reaches the measure of manhood. But come, give me a swift ship and twenty men,	τοῖς δʼ υἱὸς Φρονίοιο Νοήμων ἐγγύθεν ἐλθὼν Ἀντίνοον μύθοισιν ἀνειρόμενος προσέειπεν· Ἀντίνοʼ, ἦ ῥά τι ἴδμεν ἐνὶ φρεσίν, ἦε καὶ οὐκί, ὁππότε Τηλέμαχος νεῖτʼ ἐκ Πύλου ἠμαθόεντος; νῆά μοι οἴχετʼ ἄγων· ἐμὲ δὲ χρεὼ γίγνεται αὐτῆς
that I may watch in ambush for him as he passes in the strait between Ithaca and rugged Samos . Thus shall his voyaging in search of his father come to a sorry end.” So he spoke, and they all praised his words, and bade him act. And straightway they rose up and went to the house of Odysseus.	Ἤλιδʼ ἐς εὐρύχορον διαβήμεναι, ἔνθα μοι ἵπποι δώδεκα θήλειαι, ὑπὸ δʼ ἡμίονοι ταλαεργοὶ ἀδμῆτες· τῶν κέν τινʼ ἐλασσάμενος δαμασαίμην. ὣς ἔφαθʼ, οἱ δʼ ἀνὰ θυμὸν ἐθάμβεον· οὐ γὰρ ἔφαντο ἐς Πύλον οἴχεσθαι Νηλήιον, ἀλλά που αὐτοῦ
 Now Penelope was no long time without knowledge of the plans which the wooers were plotting in the deep of their hearts; for the herald Medon told her, who heard their counsel as he stood without the court and they within were weaving their plot. So he went through the hall to bear the tidings to Penelope;	ἀγρῶν ἢ μήλοισι παρέμμεναι ἠὲ συβώτῃ. τὸν δʼ αὖτʼ Ἀντίνοος προσέφη Εὐπείθεος υἱός· νημερτές μοι ἔνισπε, πότʼ ᾤχετο καὶ τίνες αὐτῷ κοῦροι ἕποντʼ; Ἰθάκης ἐξαίρετοι, ἦ ἑοὶ αὐτοῦ θῆτές τε δμῶές τε; δύναιτό κε καὶ τὸ τελέσσαι.
and as he stepped across the threshold Penelope spoke to him and said: “Herald, why have the lordly wooers sent thee forth? Was it to tell the handmaids of divine Odysseus to cease from their tasks, and make ready a feast for them? Never wooing any more, nor consorting together elsewhere,	καί μοι τοῦτʼ ἀγόρευσον ἐτήτυμον, ὄφρʼ ἐὺ εἰδῶ, ἤ σε βίῃ ἀέκοντος ἀπηύρα νῆα μέλαιναν, ἦε ἑκών οἱ δῶκας, ἐπεὶ προσπτύξατο μύθῳ. τὸν δʼ υἱὸς Φρονίοιο Νοήμων ἀντίον ηὔδα· αὐτὸς ἑκών οἱ δῶκα· τί κεν ῥέξειε καὶ ἄλλος,
 may they now feast here their latest and their last—even ye who are ever thronging here and wasting much livelihood, the wealth of wise Telemachus. Surely ye hearkened not at all in olden days, when ye were children, when your fathers told what manner of man Odysseus was among them that begat you,	ὁππότʼ ἀνὴρ τοιοῦτος ἔχων μελεδήματα θυμῷ αἰτίζῃ; χαλεπόν κεν ἀνήνασθαι δόσιν εἴη. κοῦροι δʼ, οἳ κατὰ δῆμον ἀριστεύουσι μεθʼ ἡμέας, οἵ οἱ ἕποντʼ· ἐν δʼ ἀρχὸν ἐγὼ βαίνοντʼ ἐνόησα Μέντορα, ἠὲ θεόν, τῷ δʼ αὐτῷ πάντα ἐῴκει.
 in that he wrought no wrong in deed or word to any man in the land, as the wont is of divine kings—one man they hate and another they love. Yet he never wrought iniquity at all to any man. But your mind and your unseemly deeds	ἀλλὰ τὸ θαυμάζω· ἴδον ἐνθάδε Μέντορα δῖον χθιζὸν ὑπηοῖον, τότε δʼ ἔμβη νηὶ Πύλονδε. ὣς ἄρα φωνήσας ἀπέβη πρὸς δώματα πατρός, τοῖσιν δʼ ἀμφοτέροισιν ἀγάσσατο θυμὸς ἀγήνωρ. μνηστῆρας δʼ ἄμυδις κάθισαν καὶ παῦσαν ἀέθλων.
are plain to see, nor is there in after days any gratitude for good deeds done.” Then Medon, wise of heart, answered her: “I would, O queen, that this were the greatest evil. But another greater far and more grievous are the wooers planning, which I pray that the son of Cronos may never bring to pass.	τοῖσιν δʼ Ἀντίνοος μετέφη Εὐπείθεος υἱός, ἀχνύμενος· μένεος δὲ μέγα φρένες ἀμφιμέλαιναι πίμπλαντʼ, ὄσσε δέ οἱ πυρὶ λαμπετόωντι ἐίκτην· ὢ πόποι, ἦ μέγα ἔργον ὑπερφιάλως ἐτελέσθη Τηλεμάχῳ ὁδὸς ἥδε· φάμεν δέ οἱ οὐ τελέεσθαι.
They are minded to slay Telemachus with the sharp sword on his homeward way; for he went in quest of tidings of his father to sacred Pylos and to goodly Lacedaemon .” So he spoke, and her knees were loosened where she sat, and her heart melted. Long time she was speechless, and both her eyes	ἐκ τοσσῶνδʼ ἀέκητι νέος πάϊς οἴχεται αὔτως νῆα ἐρυσσάμενος, κρίνας τʼ ἀνὰ δῆμον ἀρίστους. ἄρξει καὶ προτέρω κακὸν ἔμμεναι· ἀλλά οἱ αὐτῷ Ζεὺς ὀλέσειε βίην, πρὶν ἥβης μέτρον ἱκέσθαι. ἀλλʼ ἄγε μοι δότε νῆα θοὴν καὶ εἴκοσʼ ἑταίρους,
were filled with tears, and the flow of her voice was checked. But at last she made answer, and said to him: “Herald, why is my son gone? He had no need to go on board swift-faring ships, which serve men as horses of the deep, and cross over the wide waters of the sea.	ὄφρα μιν αὐτὸν ἰόντα λοχήσομαι ἠδὲ φυλάξω ἐν πορθμῷ Ἰθάκης τε Σάμοιό τε παιπαλοέσσης, ὡς ἂν ἐπισμυγερῶς ναυτίλλεται εἵνεκα πατρός. ὣς ἔφαθʼ, οἱ δʼ ἄρα πάντες ἐπῄνεον ἠδʼ ἐκέλευον. αὐτίκʼ ἔπειτʼ ἀνστάντες ἔβαν δόμον εἰς Ὀδυσῆος.
Was it that not even his name should be left among men?” Then Medon, wise of heart, answered her: “I know not whether some god impelled him, or whether his own heart was moved to go to Pylos , that he might learn either of his father's return or what fate he had met.”	οὐδʼ ἄρα Πηνελόπεια πολὺν χρόνον ἦεν ἄπυστος μύθων, οὓς μνηστῆρες ἐνὶ φρεσὶ βυσσοδόμευον· κῆρυξ γάρ οἱ ἔειπε Μέδων, ὃς ἐπεύθετο βουλὰς αὐλῆς ἐκτὸς ἐών· οἱ δʼ ἔνδοθι μῆτιν ὕφαινον. βῆ δʼ ἴμεν ἀγγελέων διὰ δώματα Πηνελοπείῃ·
 So he spoke, and departed through the house of Odysseus, and on her fell a cloud of soul-consuming grief, and she had no more the heart to sit upon one of the many seats that were in the room, but down upon the threshold of her fair-wrought chamber she sank, moaning piteously, and round about her wailed her handmaids,	τὸν δὲ κατʼ οὐδοῦ βάντα προσηύδα Πηνελόπεια· κῆρυξ, τίπτε δέ σε πρόεσαν μνηστῆρες ἀγαυοί; ἦ εἰπέμεναι δμῳῇσιν Ὀδυσσῆος θείοιο ἔργων παύσασθαι, σφίσι δʼ αὐτοῖς δαῖτα πένεσθαι; μὴ μνηστεύσαντες μηδʼ ἄλλοθʼ ὁμιλήσαντες
even all that were in the house, both young and old. Among these with sobs of lamentation spoke Penelope: “Hear me, my friends, for to me the Olympian has given sorrow above all the women who were bred and born with me. For long since I lost my noble husband of the lion heart,	ὕστατα καὶ πύματα νῦν ἐνθάδε δειπνήσειαν· οἳ θάμʼ ἀγειρόμενοι βίοτον κατακείρετε πολλόν, κτῆσιν Τηλεμάχοιο δαΐφρονος· οὐδέ τι πατρῶν ὑμετέρων τὸ πρόσθεν ἀκούετε, παῖδες ἐόντες, οἷος Ὀδυσσεὺς ἔσκε μεθʼ ὑμετέροισι τοκεῦσιν,
pre-eminent in all manner of worth among the Danaans, my noble husband, whose fame is wide through Hellas and mid- Argos . And now again my well-loved son have the storm-winds swept away from our halls without tidings, nor did I hear of his setting forth. Cruel, that ye are! Not even you took thought, any one of you,	οὔτε τινὰ ῥέξας ἐξαίσιον οὔτε τι εἰπὼν ἐν δήμῳ, ἥ τʼ ἐστὶ δίκη θείων βασιλήων· ἄλλον κʼ ἐχθαίρῃσι βροτῶν, ἄλλον κε φιλοίη. κεῖνος δʼ οὔ ποτε πάμπαν ἀτάσθαλον ἄνδρα ἐώργει. ἀλλʼ ὁ μὲν ὑμέτερος θυμὸς καὶ ἀεικέα ἔργα
 to rouse me from my couch, though in your hearts ye knew full well when he went on board the hollow black ship. For had I learned that he was pondering this journey, he should verily have stayed here, how eager soever to be gone, or he should have left me dead in the halls.	φαίνεται, οὐδέ τίς ἐστι χάρις μετόπισθʼ ἐυεργέων. τὴν δʼ αὖτε προσέειπε Μέδων πεπνυμένα εἰδώς· αἲ γὰρ δή, βασίλεια, τόδε πλεῖστον κακὸν εἴη. ἀλλὰ πολὺ μεῖζόν τε καὶ ἀργαλεώτερον ἄλλο μνηστῆρες φράζονται, ὃ μὴ τελέσειε Κρονίων·
 But now let one hasten to call hither the aged Dolius, my servant, whom my father gave me or ever I came hither, and who keeps my garden of many trees, that he may straightway go and sit by Laertes, and tell him of all these things. So haply may Laertes weave some plan in his heart,	Τηλέμαχον μεμάασι κατακτάμεν ὀξέι χαλκῷ οἴκαδε νισόμενον· ὁ δʼ ἔβη μετὰ πατρὸς ἀκουὴν ἐς Πύλον ἠγαθέην ἠδʼ ἐς Λακεδαίμονα δῖαν. ὣς φάτο, τῆς δʼ αὐτοῦ λύτο γούνατα καὶ φίλον ἦτορ, δὴν δέ μιν ἀμφασίη ἐπέων λάβε· τὼ δέ οἱ ὄσσε
and go forth and with weeping make his plea to the people, who are minded to destroy his race and that of godlike Odysseus.” Then the good nurse Eurycleia answered her:“Dear lady, thou mayest verily slay me with the pitiless sword or let me abide in the house, yet will I not hide my word from thee.	δακρυόφι πλῆσθεν, θαλερὴ δέ οἱ ἔσχετο φωνή. ὀψὲ δὲ δή μιν ἔπεσσιν ἀμειβομένη προσέειπε· κῆρυξ, τίπτε δέ μοι πάϊς οἴχεται; οὐδέ τί μιν χρεὼ νηῶν ὠκυπόρων ἐπιβαινέμεν, αἵ θʼ ἁλὸς ἵπποι ἀνδράσι γίγνονται, περόωσι δὲ πουλὺν ἐφʼ ὑγρήν.
 I knew all this, and gave him whatever he bade me, bread and sweet wine. But he took from me a mighty oath not to tell thee until at least the twelfth day should come, or thou shouldst thyself miss him and hear that he was gone, that thou mightest not mar thy fair flesh with weeping.	ἦ ἵνα μηδʼ ὄνομʼ αὐτοῦ ἐν ἀνθρώποισι λίπηται; τὴν δʼ ἠμείβετʼ ἔπειτα Μέδων πεπνυμένα εἰδώς· οὐκ οἶδʼ ἤ τίς μιν θεὸς ὤρορεν, ἦε καὶ αὐτοῦ θυμὸς ἐφωρμήθη ἴμεν ἐς Πύλον, ὄφρα πύθηται πατρὸς ἑοῦ ἢ νόστον ἢ ὅν τινα πότμον ἐπέσπεν.
 But now bathe thyself, and take clean raiment for thy body, and then go up to thy upper chamber with thy handmaids and pray to Athena, the daughter of Zeus who bears the aegis; for she may then save him even from death. And trouble not a troubled old man; for	ὣς ἄρα φωνήσας ἀπέβη κατὰ δῶμʼ Ὀδυσῆος. τὴν δʼ ἄχος ἀμφεχύθη θυμοφθόρον, οὐδʼ ἄρʼ ἔτʼ ἔτλη δίφρῳ ἐφέζεσθαι πολλῶν κατὰ οἶκον ἐόντων, ἀλλʼ ἄρʼ ἐπʼ οὐδοῦ ἷζε πολυκμήτου θαλάμοιο οἴκτρʼ ὀλοφυρομένη· περὶ δὲ δμῳαὶ μινύριζον
the race of the son of Arceisius is not, methinks, utterly hated by the blessed gods, but there shall still be one, I ween, to hold the high-roofed halls and the rich fields far away.” So she spoke, and lulled Penelope's laments, and made her eyes to cease from weeping. She then bathed, and took clean raiment for her body,	πᾶσαι, ὅσαι κατὰ δώματʼ ἔσαν νέαι ἠδὲ παλαιαί. τῇς δʼ ἁδινὸν γοόωσα μετηύδα Πηνελόπεια· κλῦτε, φίλαι· πέρι γάρ μοι Ὀλύμπιος ἄλγεʼ ἔδωκεν ἐκ πασέων, ὅσσαι μοι ὁμοῦ τράφεν ἠδʼ ἐγένοντο· ἣ πρὶν μὲν πόσιν ἐσθλὸν ἀπώλεσα θυμολέοντα,
and went up to her upper chamber with her handmaids, and placing barley grains in a basket prayed to Athena: “Hear me, child of Zeus who bears the aegis, unwearied one. If ever Odysseus, of many wiles, burnt to thee in his halls fat thigh-pieces of heifer or ewe,	παντοίῃς ἀρετῇσι κεκασμένον ἐν Δαναοῖσιν, ἐσθλόν, τοῦ κλέος εὐρὺ καθʼ Ἑλλάδα καὶ μέσον Ἄργος. νῦν αὖ παῖδʼ ἀγαπητὸν ἀνηρείψαντο θύελλαι ἀκλέα ἐκ μεγάρων, οὐδʼ ὁρμηθέντος ἄκουσα. σχέτλιαι, οὐδʼ ὑμεῖς περ ἐνὶ φρεσὶ θέσθε ἑκάστη
remember these things now, I pray thee, and save my dear son, and ward off from him the wooers in their evil insolence.” So saying she raised the sacred cry, and the goddess heard her prayer. But the wooers broke into uproar throughout the shadowy halls, and thus would one of the proud youths speak:	ἐκ λεχέων μʼ ἀνεγεῖραι, ἐπιστάμεναι σάφα θυμῷ, ὁππότʼ ἐκεῖνος ἔβη κοίλην ἐπὶ νῆα μέλαιναν. εἰ γὰρ ἐγὼ πυθόμην ταύτην ὁδὸν ὁρμαίνοντα, τῷ κε μάλʼ ἤ κεν ἔμεινε καὶ ἐσσύμενός περ ὁδοῖο, ἤ κέ με τεθνηκυῖαν ἐνὶ μεγάροισιν ἔλειπεν.
“Aye, verily the queen, wooed of many, is preparing our marriage, nor does she know at all that death has been made ready for her son.” So would one of them speak; but they knew not how these things were to be. And Antinous addressed their company, and said: “Good sirs, shun haughty speech	ἀλλά τις ὀτρηρῶς Δολίον καλέσειε γέροντα, δμῶʼ ἐμόν, ὅν μοι δῶκε πατὴρ ἔτι δεῦρο κιούσῃ, καί μοι κῆπον ἔχει πολυδένδρεον, ὄφρα τάχιστα Λαέρτῃ τάδε πάντα παρεζόμενος καταλέξῃ, εἰ δή πού τινα κεῖνος ἐνὶ φρεσὶ μῆτιν ὑφήνας
of every kind alike, lest someone report your speech even within the house. Nay come, in silence thus let us arise and put into effect our plan which pleased us one and all at heart.” So he spoke, and chose twenty men that were best, and they went their way to the swift ship and the shore of the sea.	ἐξελθὼν λαοῖσιν ὀδύρεται, οἳ μεμάασιν ὃν καὶ Ὀδυσσῆος φθῖσαι γόνον ἀντιθέοιο. τὴν δʼ αὖτε προσέειπε φίλη τροφὸς Εὐρύκλεια· νύμφα φίλη, σὺ μὲν ἄρ με κατάκτανε νηλέι χαλκῷ ἢ ἔα ἐν μεγάρῳ· μῦθον δέ τοι οὐκ ἐπικεύσω.
 The ship first of all they drew down to the deep water, and set the mast and sail in the black ship, and fitted the oars in the leathern thole-straps, all in due order, and spread the white sail. And proud squires brought them their weapons.	ᾔδεʼ ἐγὼ τάδε πάντα, πόρον δέ οἱ ὅσσʼ ἐκέλευε, σῖτον καὶ μέθυ ἡδύ· ἐμεῦ δʼ ἕλετο μέγαν ὅρκον μὴ πρὶν σοὶ ἐρέειν, πρὶν δωδεκάτην γε γενέσθαι ἢ σʼ αὐτὴν ποθέσαι καὶ ἀφορμηθέντος ἀκοῦσαι, ὡς ἂν μὴ κλαίουσα κατὰ χρόα καλὸν ἰάπτῃς.
Well out in the roadstead they moored the ship, and themselves disembarked. There then they took supper, and waited till evening should come. But she, the wise Penelope, lay there in her upper chamber, touching no food, tasting neither meat nor drink, pondering whether her peerless son would escape death,	ἀλλʼ ὑδρηναμένη, καθαρὰ χροῒ εἵμαθʼ ἑλοῦσα, εἰς ὑπερῷʼ ἀναβᾶσα σὺν ἀμφιπόλοισι γυναιξὶν εὔχεʼ Ἀθηναίῃ κούρῃ Διὸς αἰγιόχοιο· ἡ γάρ κέν μιν ἔπειτα καὶ ἐκ θανάτοιο σαώσαι. μηδὲ γέροντα κάκου κεκακωμένον· οὐ γὰρ ὀίω
or be slain by the insolent wooers. And even as a lion is seized with fear and broods amid a throng of men, when they draw their crafty ring about him, so was she pondering when sweet sleep came upon her. And she sank back and slept, and all her joints relaxed.	πάγχυ θεοῖς μακάρεσσι γονὴν Ἀρκεισιάδαο ἔχθεσθʼ, ἀλλʼ ἔτι πού τις ἐπέσσεται ὅς κεν ἔχῃσι δώματά θʼ ὑψερεφέα καὶ ἀπόπροθι πίονας ἀγρούς. ὣς φάτο, τῆς δʼ εὔνησε γόον, σχέθε δʼ ὄσσε γόοιο. ἡ δʼ ὑδρηναμένη, καθαρὰ χροῒ εἵμαθʼ ἑλοῦσα
 Then the goddess, flashing-eyed Athena, took other counsel. She made a phantom, and likened it in form to a woman, Iphthime, daughter of great-hearted Icarius, whom Eumelus wedded, whose home was in Pherae. And she sent it to the house of divine Odysseus,	εἰς ὑπερῷʼ ἀνέβαινε σὺν ἀμφιπόλοισι γυναιξίν, ἐν δʼ ἔθετʼ οὐλοχύτας κανέῳ, ἠρᾶτο δʼ Ἀθήνῃ· κλῦθί μευ, αἰγιόχοιο Διὸς τέκος, Ἀτρυτώνη, εἴ ποτέ τοι πολύμητις ἐνὶ μεγάροισιν Ὀδυσσεὺς ἢ βοὸς ἢ ὄϊος κατὰ πίονα μηρίʼ ἔκηε,
to Penelope in the midst of her wailing and lamenting, to bid her cease from weeping and tearful lamentation. So into the chamber it passed by the thong of the bolt, and stood above her head, and spoke to her, and said: “Sleepest thou, Penelope, thy heart sore stricken?	τῶν νῦν μοι μνῆσαι, καί μοι φίλον υἷα σάωσον, μνηστῆρας δʼ ἀπάλαλκε κακῶς ὑπερηνορέοντας. ὣς εἰποῦσʼ ὀλόλυξε, θεὰ δέ οἱ ἔκλυεν ἀρῆς. μνηστῆρες δʼ ὁμάδησαν ἀνὰ μέγαρα σκιόεντα· ὧδε δέ τις εἴπεσκε νέων ὑπερηνορεόντων·
Nay, the gods that live at ease suffer thee not to weep or be distressed, seeing that thy son is yet to return; for in no wise is he a sinner in the eyes of the gods.” Then wise Penelope answered her, as she slumbered very sweetly at the gates of dreams:	ἦ μάλα δὴ γάμον ἄμμι πολυμνήστη βασίλεια ἀρτύει, οὐδέ τι οἶδεν ὅ οἱ φόνος υἷι τέτυκται. ὣς ἄρα τις εἴπεσκε, τὰ δʼ οὐκ ἴσαν ὡς ἐτέτυκτο. τοῖσιν δʼ Ἀντίνοος ἀγορήσατο καὶ μετέειπε· δαιμόνιοι, μύθους μὲν ὑπερφιάλους ἀλέασθε
 “Why, sister, art thou come hither? Thou hast not heretofore been wont to come, for thou dwellest in a home far away. And thou biddest me cease from my grief and the many pains that distress me in mind and heart. Long since I lost my noble husband of the lion heart,	πάντας ὁμῶς, μή πού τις ἀπαγγείλῃσι καὶ εἴσω. ἀλλʼ ἄγε σιγῇ τοῖον ἀναστάντες τελέωμεν μῦθον, ὃ δὴ καὶ πᾶσιν ἐνὶ φρεσὶν ἤραρεν ἡμῖν. ὣς εἰπὼν ἐκρίνατʼ ἐείκοσι φῶτας ἀρίστους, βὰν δʼ ἰέναι ἐπὶ νῆα θοὴν καὶ θῖνα θαλάσσης.
pre-eminent in all manner of worth among the Danaans, my noble husband whose fame is wide in Hellas and mid- Argos . And now again my well-loved son is gone forth in a hollow ship, a mere child, knowing naught of toils and the gatherings of men. For him I sorrow even more than for that other,	νῆα μὲν οὖν πάμπρωτον ἁλὸς βένθοσδε ἔρυσσαν, ἐν δʼ ἱστόν τʼ ἐτίθεντο καὶ ἱστία νηὶ μελαίνῃ, ἠρτύναντο δʼ ἐρετμὰ τροποῖς ἐν δερματίνοισιν, πάντα κατὰ μοῖραν, ἀνά θʼ ἱστία λευκὰ πέτασσαν· τεύχεα δέ σφʼ ἤνεικαν ὑπέρθυμοι θεράποντες.
and tremble for him, and fear lest aught befall him, whether it be in the land of the men to whom he is gone, or on the sea. For many foes are plotting against him, eager to slay him before he comes back to his native land.” Then the dim phantom answered her, and said:	ὑψοῦ δʼ ἐν νοτίῳ τήν γʼ ὥρμισαν, ἐκ δʼ ἔβαν αὐτοί· ἔνθα δὲ δόρπον ἕλοντο, μένον δʼ ἐπὶ ἕσπερον ἐλθεῖν. ἡ δʼ ὑπερωίῳ αὖθι περίφρων Πηνελόπεια κεῖτʼ ἄρʼ ἄσιτος, ἄπαστος ἐδητύος ἠδὲ ποτῆτος, ὁρμαίνουσʼ ἤ οἱ θάνατον φύγοι υἱὸς ἀμύμων,
“Take heart, and be not in thy mind too sore afraid; since such a guide goes with him as men have full often besought to stand by their side, for she has power,—even Pallas Athena. And she pities thee in thy sorrow, for she it is that has sent me forth to tell thee this.”	ἦ ὅ γʼ ὑπὸ μνηστῆρσιν ὑπερφιάλοισι δαμείη. ὅσσα δὲ μερμήριξε λέων ἀνδρῶν ἐν ὁμίλῳ δείσας, ὁππότε μιν δόλιον περὶ κύκλον ἄγωσι, τόσσα μιν ὁρμαίνουσαν ἐπήλυθε νήδυμος ὕπνος· εὗδε δʼ ἀνακλινθεῖσα, λύθεν δέ οἱ ἅψεα πάντα.
Then again wise Penelope answered her: “If thou art indeed a god, and hast listened to the voice of a god, come, tell me, I pray thee, also of that hapless one, whether he still lives and beholds the light of the sun, or whether he is already dead and in the house of Hades.”	ἔνθʼ αὖτʼ ἄλλʼ ἐνόησε θεά, γλαυκῶπις Ἀθήνη· εἴδωλον ποίησε, δέμας δʼ ἤικτο γυναικί, Ἰφθίμῃ, κούρῃ μεγαλήτορος Ἰκαρίοιο, τὴν Εὔμηλος ὄπυιε Φερῇς ἔνι οἰκία ναίων. πέμπε δέ μιν πρὸς δώματʼ Ὀδυσσῆος θείοιο,
And the dim phantom answered her, and said:“Nay, of him I may not speak at length, whether he be alive or dead; it is an ill thing to speak words vain as wind.” So saying the phantom glided away by the bolt of the door into the breath of the winds. And	ἧος Πηνελόπειαν ὀδυρομένην γοόωσαν παύσειε κλαυθμοῖο γόοιό τε δακρυόεντος. ἐς θάλαμον δʼ εἰσῆλθε παρὰ κληῖδος ἱμάντα, στῆ δʼ ἄρʼ ὑπὲρ κεφαλῆς, καί μιν πρὸς μῦθον ἔειπεν· εὕδεις, Πηνελόπεια, φίλον τετιημένη ἦτορ;
the daughter of Icarius started up from sleep, and her heart was warmed with comfort, that so clear a vision had sped to her in the darkness of night. But the wooers embarked, and sailed over the watery ways, pondering in their hearts utter murder for Telemachus. There is a rocky isle in the midst of the sea,	οὐ μέν σʼ οὐδὲ ἐῶσι θεοὶ ῥεῖα ζώοντες κλαίειν οὐδʼ ἀκάχησθαι, ἐπεί ῥʼ ἔτι νόστιμός ἐστι σὸς παῖς· οὐ μὲν γάρ τι θεοῖς ἀλιτήμενός ἐστι. τὴν δʼ ἠμείβετʼ ἔπειτα περίφρων Πηνελόπεια, ἡδὺ μάλα κνώσσουσʼ ἐν ὀνειρείῃσι πύλῃσιν·
midway between Ithaca and rugged Samos , Asteris, of no great size, but therein is a harbor where ships may lie, with an entrance on either side. There it was that the Achaeans tarried, lying in wait for Telemachus.	τίπτε, κασιγνήτη, δεῦρʼ ἤλυθες; οὔ τι πάρος γε πωλέʼ, ἐπεὶ μάλα πολλὸν ἀπόπροθι δώματα ναίεις· καί με κέλεαι παύσασθαι ὀιζύος ἠδʼ ὀδυνάων πολλέων, αἵ μʼ ἐρέθουσι κατὰ φρένα καὶ κατὰ θυμόν, ἣ πρὶν μὲν πόσιν ἐσθλὸν ἀπώλεσα θυμολέοντα,
 Now Dawn arose from her couch from beside lordly Tithonus, to bear light to the immortals and to mortal men. And the gods were sitting down to council, and among them Zeus, who thunders on high, whose might is supreme.	τοῦ δʼ ἀμφιτρομέω καὶ δείδια, μή τι πάθῃσιν, ἢ ὅ γε τῶν ἐνὶ δήμῳ, ἵνʼ οἴχεται, ἢ ἐνὶ πόντῳ· δυσμενέες γὰρ πολλοὶ ἐπʼ αὐτῷ μηχανόωνται, ἱέμενοι κτεῖναι πρὶν πατρίδα γαῖαν ἱκέσθαι. τὴν δʼ ἀπαμειβόμενον προσέφη εἴδωλον ἀμαυρόν·
To them Athena was recounting the many woes of Odysseus, as she called them to mind; for it troubled her that he abode in the dwelling of the nymph: “Father Zeus, and ye other blessed gods that are forever, never henceforward let sceptred king with a ready heart be kind and gentle, nor let him heed righteousness in his mind;	θάρσει, μηδέ τι πάγχυ μετὰ φρεσὶ δείδιθι λίην· τοίη γάρ οἱ πομπὸς ἅμʼ ἔρχεται, ἥν τε καὶ ἄλλοι ἀνέρες ἠρήσαντο παρεστάμεναι, δύναται γάρ, Παλλὰς Ἀθηναίη· σὲ δʼ ὀδυρομένην ἐλεαίρει· ἣ νῦν με προέηκε τεῒν τάδε μυθήσασθαι.
 but let him ever be harsh, and work unrighteousness, seeing that no one remembers divine Odysseus of the people whose lord he was; yet gentle was he as a father. He verily abides in an island suffering grievous pains, in the halls of the nymph Calypso, who	τὴν δʼ αὖτε προσέειπε περίφρων Πηνελόπεια· εἰ μὲν δὴ θεός ἐσσι θεοῖό τε ἔκλυες αὐδῆς, εἰ δʼ ἄγε μοι καὶ κεῖνον ὀιζυρὸν κατάλεξον, ἤ που ἔτι ζώει καὶ ὁρᾷ φάος ἠελίοιο, ἦ ἤδη τέθνηκε καὶ εἰν Ἀίδαο δόμοισι.
 keeps him perforce; and he cannot return to his own land, for he has at hand no ships with oars and no comrades to send him on his way over the broad back of the sea. And now again they are minded to slay his well-loved son on his homeward way; for he went in quest of tidings of his father	τὴν δʼ ἀπαμειβόμενον προσέφη εἴδωλον ἀμαυρόν· οὐ μέν τοι κεῖνόν γε διηνεκέως ἀγορεύσω, ζώει ὅ γʼ ἦ τέθνηκε· κακὸν δʼ ἀνεμώλια βάζειν. ὣς εἰπὸν σταθμοῖο παρὰ κληῖδα λιάσθη ἐς πνοιὰς ἀνέμων. ἡ δʼ ἐξ ὕπνου ἀνόρουσε
to sacred Pylos and to goodly Lacedaemon .” Then Zeus, the cloud-gatherer, answered her, and said: “My child, what a word has escaped the barrier of thy teeth! Didst thou not thyself devise this plan, that verily Odysseus might take vengeance on these men at his coming?	κούρη Ἰκαρίοιο· φίλον δέ οἱ ἦτορ ἰάνθη, ὥς οἱ ἐναργὲς ὄνειρον ἐπέσσυτο νυκτὸς ἀμολγῷ. μνηστῆρες δʼ ἀναβάντες ἐπέπλεον ὑγρὰ κέλευθα Τηλεμάχῳ φόνον αἰπὺν ἐνὶ φρεσὶν ὁρμαίνοντες. ἔστι δέ τις νῆσος μέσσῃ ἁλὶ πετρήεσσα,
But concerning Telemachus, do thou guide him in thy wisdom, for thou canst, that all unscathed he may reach his native land, and the wooers may come back in their ship baffled in their purpose.” He spoke, and said to Hermes, his dear son:“Hermes, do thou now, seeing that thou art at other times our messenger,	μεσσηγὺς Ἰθάκης τε Σάμοιό τε παιπαλοέσσης, Ἀστερίς, οὐ μεγάλη· λιμένες δʼ ἔνι ναύλοχοι αὐτῇ ἀμφίδυμοι· τῇ τόν γε μένον λοχόωντες Ἀχαιοί.
the land of the Phaeacians, who are near of kin to the gods. These shall heartily shew him all honor, as if he were a god, and shall send him in a ship to his dear native land, after giving him stores of bronze and gold and raiment, more than Odysseus would ever have won for himself from Troy ,	Ἠὼς δʼ ἐκ λεχέων παρʼ ἀγαυοῦ Τιθωνοῖο ὤρνυθʼ, ἵνʼ ἀθανάτοισι φόως φέροι ἠδὲ βροτοῖσιν· οἱ δὲ θεοὶ θῶκόνδε καθίζανον, ἐν δʼ ἄρα τοῖσι Ζεὺς ὑψιβρεμέτης, οὗ τε κράτος ἐστὶ μέγιστον.
if he had returned unscathed with his due share of the spoil. For in this wise it is his fate to see his friends, and reach his high-roofed house and his native land.” So he spoke, and the messenger, Argeiphontes, failed not to hearken. Straightway he bound beneath his feet his beautiful sandals,	τοῖσι δʼ Ἀθηναίη λέγε κήδεα πόλλʼ Ὀδυσῆος μνησαμένη· μέλε γάρ οἱ ἐὼν ἐν δώμασι νύμφης· Ζεῦ πάτερ ἠδʼ ἄλλοι μάκαρες θεοὶ αἰὲν ἐόντες, μή τις ἔτι πρόφρων ἀγανὸς καὶ ἤπιος ἔστω σκηπτοῦχος βασιλεύς, μηδὲ φρεσὶν αἴσιμα εἰδώς,
immortal, golden, which were wont to bear him over the waters of the sea and over the boundless land swift as the blasts of the wind. And he took the wand wherewith he lulls to sleep the eyes of whom he will, while others again he awakens even out of slumber. With this in his hand the strong Argeiphontes flew.	ἀλλʼ αἰεὶ χαλεπός τʼ εἴη καὶ αἴσυλα ῥέζοι· ὡς οὔ τις μέμνηται Ὀδυσσῆος θείοιο λαῶν οἷσιν ἄνασσε, πατὴρ δʼ ὣς ἤπιος ἦεν. ἀλλʼ ὁ μὲν ἐν νήσῳ κεῖται κρατέρʼ ἄλγεα πάσχων νύμφης ἐν μεγάροισι Καλυψοῦς, ἥ μιν ἀνάγκῃ
On to Pieria he stepped from the upper air, and swooped down upon the sea, and then sped over the wave like a bird, the cormorant, which in quest of fish over the dread gulfs of the unresting sea wets its thick plumage in the brine. In such wise did Hermes ride upon the multitudinous waves.	ἴσχει· ὁ δʼ οὐ δύναται ἣν πατρίδα γαῖαν ἱκέσθαι· οὐ γάρ οἱ πάρα νῆες ἐπήρετμοι καὶ ἑταῖροι, οἵ κέν μιν πέμποιεν ἐπʼ εὐρέα νῶτα θαλάσσης. νῦν αὖ παῖδʼ ἀγαπητὸν ἀποκτεῖναι μεμάασιν οἴκαδε νισόμενον· ὁ δʼ ἔβη μετὰ πατρὸς ἀκουὴν
 But when he had reached the island which lay afar, then forth from the violet sea he came to land, and went his way until he came to a great cave, wherein dwelt the fair-tressed nymph; and he found her within. A great fire was burning on the hearth, and from afar over the isle there was a fragrance	ἐς Πύλον ἠγαθέην ἠδʼ ἐς Λακεδαίμονα δῖαν. τὴν δʼ ἀπαμειβόμενος προσέφη νεφεληγερέτα Ζεύς· τέκνον ἐμόν, ποῖόν σε ἔπος φύγεν ἕρκος ὀδόντων. οὐ γὰρ δὴ τοῦτον μὲν ἐβούλευσας νόον αὐτή, ὡς ἦ τοι κείνους Ὀδυσεὺς ἀποτίσεται ἐλθών;
 of cleft cedar and juniper, as they burned; but she within was singing with a sweet voice as she went to and fro before the loom, weaving with a golden shuttle. Round about the cave grew a luxuriant wood, alder and poplar and sweet-smelling cypress,	Τηλέμαχον δὲ σὺ πέμψον ἐπισταμένως, δύνασαι γάρ, ὥς κε μάλʼ ἀσκηθὴς ἣν πατρίδα γαῖαν ἵκηται, μνηστῆρες δʼ ἐν νηὶ· παλιμπετὲς ἀπονέωνται. ἦ ῥα καὶ Ἑρμείαν, υἱὸν φίλον, ἀντίον ηὔδα· Ἑρμεία, σὺ γὰρ αὖτε τά τʼ ἄλλα περ ἄγγελός ἐσσι,
 wherein birds long of wing were wont to nest, owls and falcons and sea-crows with chattering tongues, who ply their business on the sea. And right there about the hollow cave ran trailing a garden vine, in pride of its prime, richly laden with clusters.	νύμφῃ ἐυπλοκάμῳ εἰπεῖν νημερτέα βουλήν, νόστον Ὀδυσσῆος ταλασίφρονος, ὥς κε νέηται οὔτε θεῶν πομπῇ οὔτε θνητῶν ἀνθρώπων· ἀλλʼ ὅ γʼ ἐπὶ σχεδίης πολυδέσμου πήματα πάσχων ἤματί κʼ εἰκοστῷ Σχερίην ἐρίβωλον ἵκοιτο,
 And fountains four in a row were flowing with bright water hard by one another, turned one this way, one that. And round about soft meadows of violets and parsley were blooming. There even an immortal, who chanced to come, might gaze and marvel, and delight his soul;	Φαιήκων ἐς γαῖαν, οἳ ἀγχίθεοι γεγάασιν, οἵ κέν μιν περὶ κῆρι θεὸν ὣς τιμήσουσιν, πέμψουσιν δʼ ἐν νηὶ φίλην ἐς πατρίδα γαῖαν, χαλκόν τε χρυσόν τε ἅλις ἐσθῆτά τε δόντες, πόλλʼ, ὅσʼ ἂν οὐδέ ποτε Τροίης ἐξήρατʼ Ὀδυσσεύς,
 and there the messenger Argeiphontes stood and marvelled. But when he had marvelled in his heart at all things, straightway he went into the wide cave; nor did Calypso, the beautiful goddess, fail to know him, when she saw him face to face; for not unknown are	εἴ περ ἀπήμων ἦλθε, λαχὼν ἀπὸ ληίδος αἶσαν. ὣς γάρ οἱ μοῖρʼ ἐστὶ φίλους τʼ ἰδέειν καὶ ἱκέσθαι οἶκον ἐς ὑψόροφον καὶ ἑὴν ἐς πατρίδα γαῖαν. ὣς ἔφατʼ, οὐδʼ ἀπίθησε διάκτορος ἀργεϊφόντης. αὐτίκʼ ἔπειθʼ ὑπὸ ποσσὶν ἐδήσατο καλὰ πέδιλα,
 the immortal gods to one another, even though one dwells in a home far away. But the great-hearted Odysseus he found not within; for he sat weeping on the shore, as his wont had been, racking his soul with tears and groans and griefs, and he would look over the unresting sea, shedding tears.	ἀμβρόσια χρύσεια, τά μιν φέρον ἠμὲν ἐφʼ ὑγρὴν ἠδʼ ἐπʼ ἀπείρονα γαῖαν ἅμα πνοιῇς ἀνέμοιο. εἵλετο δὲ ῥάβδον, τῇ τʼ ἀνδρῶν ὄμματα θέλγει, ὧν ἐθέλει, τοὺς δʼ αὖτε καὶ ὑπνώοντας ἐγείρει. τὴν μετὰ χερσὶν ἔχων πέτετο κρατὺς ἀργεϊφόντης.
And Calypso, the beautiful goddess, questioned Hermes, when she had made him sit on a bright shining chair: “Why, pray, Hermes of the golden wand, hast thou come, an honorable guest and welcome? heretofore thou hast not been wont to come. Speak what is in thy mind; my heart bids me fulfil it,	Πιερίην δʼ ἐπιβὰς ἐξ αἰθέρος ἔμπεσε πόντῳ· σεύατʼ ἔπειτʼ ἐπὶ κῦμα λάρῳ ὄρνιθι ἐοικώς, ὅς τε κατὰ δεινοὺς κόλπους ἁλὸς ἀτρυγέτοιο ἰχθῦς ἀγρώσσων πυκινὰ πτερὰ δεύεται ἅλμῃ· τῷ ἴκελος πολέεσσιν ὀχήσατο κύμασιν Ἑρμῆς.
if fulfil it I can, and it is a thing that hath fulfillment. But follow me further, that I may set before thee entertainment.” So saying, the goddess set before him a table laden with ambrosia, and mixed the ruddy nectar. So he drank and ate, the messenger Argeiphontes.	ἀλλʼ ὅτε δὴ τὴν νῆσον ἀφίκετο τηλόθʼ ἐοῦσαν, ἔνθʼ ἐκ πόντου βὰς ἰοειδέος ἤπειρόνδε ἤιεν, ὄφρα μέγα σπέος ἵκετο, τῷ ἔνι νύμφη ναῖεν ἐυπλόκαμος· τὴν δʼ ἔνδοθι τέτμεν ἐοῦσαν. πῦρ μὲν ἐπʼ ἐσχαρόφιν μέγα καίετο, τηλόσε δʼ ὀδμὴ
But when he had dined and satisfied his soul with food, then he made answer, and addressed her, saying: “Thou, a goddess, dost question me, a god, upon my coming, and I will speak my word truly, since thou biddest me. It was Zeus who bade me come hither against my will.	κέδρου τʼ εὐκεάτοιο θύου τʼ ἀνὰ νῆσον ὀδώδει δαιομένων· ἡ δʼ ἔνδον ἀοιδιάουσʼ ὀπὶ καλῇ ἱστὸν ἐποιχομένη χρυσείῃ κερκίδʼ ὕφαινεν. ὕλη δὲ σπέος ἀμφὶ πεφύκει τηλεθόωσα, κλήθρη τʼ αἴγειρός τε καὶ εὐώδης κυπάρισσος.
 Who of his own will would speed over so great space of salt sea-water, great past telling? Nor is there at hand any city of mortals who offer to the gods sacrifice and choice hecatombs. But it is in no wise possible for any other god to evade or make void the will of Zeus, who bears the aegis.	ἔνθα δέ τʼ ὄρνιθες τανυσίπτεροι εὐνάζοντο, σκῶπές τʼ ἴρηκές τε τανύγλωσσοί τε κορῶναι εἰνάλιαι, τῇσίν τε θαλάσσια ἔργα μέμηλεν. ἡ δʼ αὐτοῦ τετάνυστο περὶ σπείους γλαφυροῖο ἡμερὶς ἡβώωσα, τεθήλει δὲ σταφυλῇσι.
 He says that there is here with thee a man most wretched above all those warriors who around the city of Priam fought for nine years, and in the tenth year sacked the city and departed homeward. But on the way they sinned against Athena, and she sent upon them an evil wind and long waves.	κρῆναι δʼ ἑξείης πίσυρες ῥέον ὕδατι λευκῷ, πλησίαι ἀλλήλων τετραμμέναι ἄλλυδις ἄλλη. ἀμφὶ δὲ λειμῶνες μαλακοὶ ἴου ἠδὲ σελίνου θήλεον. ἔνθα κʼ ἔπειτα καὶ ἀθάνατός περ ἐπελθὼν θηήσαιτο ἰδὼν καὶ τερφθείη φρεσὶν ᾗσιν.
 There all the rest of his goodly comrades perished, but as for him, the wind and the wave, as they bore him, brought him hither. Him now Zeus bids thee to send on his way with all speed, for it is not his fate to perish here far from his friends, but it is still his lot to see his friends and reach	ἔνθα στὰς θηεῖτο διάκτορος ἀργεϊφόντης. αὐτὰρ ἐπεὶ δὴ πάντα ἑῷ θηήσατο θυμῷ, αὐτίκʼ ἄρʼ εἰς εὐρὺ σπέος ἤλυθεν. οὐδέ μιν ἄντην ἠγνοίησεν ἰδοῦσα Καλυψώ, δῖα θεάων· οὐ γάρ τʼ ἀγνῶτες θεοὶ ἀλλήλοισι πέλονται
his high-roofed house and his native land.” So he spoke, and Calypso, the beautiful goddess, shuddered, and she spoke, and addressed him with winged words: “Cruel are ye, O ye gods, and quick to envy above all others, seeing that ye begrudge goddesses that they should mate with men	ἀθάνατοι, οὐδʼ εἴ τις ἀπόπροθι δώματα ναίει. οὐδʼ ἄρʼ Ὀδυσσῆα μεγαλήτορα ἔνδον ἔτετμεν, ἀλλʼ ὅ γʼ ἐπʼ ἀκτῆς κλαῖε καθήμενος, ἔνθα πάρος περ, δάκρυσι καὶ στοναχῇσι καὶ ἄλγεσι θυμὸν ἐρέχθων. πόντον ἐπʼ ἀτρύγετον δερκέσκετο δάκρυα λείβων.
openly, if any takes a mortal as her dear bed-fellow. Thus, when rosy-fingered Dawn took to herself Orion, ye gods that live at ease begrudged her, till in Ortygia chaste Artemis of the golden throne assailed him with her gentle shafts and slew him.	Ἑρμείαν δʼ ἐρέεινε Καλυψώ, δῖα θεάων, ἐν θρόνῳ ἱδρύσασα φαεινῷ σιγαλόεντι· τίπτε μοι, Ἑρμεία χρυσόρραπι, εἰλήλουθας αἰδοῖός τε φίλος τε; πάρος γε μὲν οὔ τι θαμίζεις. αὔδα ὅ τι φρονέεις· τελέσαι δέ με θυμὸς ἄνωγεν,
 Thus too, when fair-tressed Demeter, yielding to her passion, lay in love with Iasion in the thrice-ploughed fallow land, Zeus was not long without knowledge thereof, but smote him with his bright thunder-bolt and slew him. And even so again do ye now begrudge me, O ye gods, that a mortal man should abide with me.	εἰ δύναμαι τελέσαι γε καὶ εἰ τετελεσμένον ἐστίν. ἀλλʼ ἕπεο προτέρω, ἵνα τοι πὰρ ξείνια θείω. ὥς ἄρα φωνήσασα θεὰ παρέθηκε τράπεζαν ἀμβροσίης πλήσασα, κέρασσε δὲ νέκταρ ἐρυθρόν. αὐτὰρ ὁ πῖνε καὶ ἦσθε διάκτορος ἀργεϊφόντης.
Him I saved when he was bestriding the keel and all alone, for Zeus had smitten his swift ship with his bright thunder-bolt, and had shattered it in the midst of the wine-dark sea. There all the rest of his goodly comrades perished, but as for him, the wind and the wave, as they bore him, brought him hither.	αὐτὰρ ἐπεὶ δείπνησε καὶ ἤραρε θυμὸν ἐδωδῇ, καὶ τότε δή μιν ἔπεσσιν ἀμειβόμενος προσέειπεν· εἰρωτᾷς μʼ ἐλθόντα θεὰ θεόν· αὐτὰρ ἐγώ τοι νημερτέως τὸν μῦθον ἐνισπήσω· κέλεαι γάρ. Ζεὺς ἐμέ γʼ ἠνώγει δεῦρʼ ἐλθέμεν οὐκ ἐθέλοντα·
 Him I welcomed kindly and gave him food, and said that I would make him immortal and ageless all his days. But since it is in no wise possible for any other god to evade or make void the will of Zeus who bears the aegis, let him go his way, if Zeus thus orders and commands,	τίς δʼ ἂν ἑκὼν τοσσόνδε διαδράμοι ἁλμυρὸν ὕδωρ ἄσπετον; οὐδέ τις ἄγχι βροτῶν πόλις, οἵ τε θεοῖσιν ἱερά τε ῥέζουσι καὶ ἐξαίτους ἑκατόμβας. ἀλλὰ μάλʼ οὔ πως ἔστι Διὸς νόον αἰγιόχοιο οὔτε παρεξελθεῖν ἄλλον θεὸν οὔθʼ ἁλιῶσαι.
over the unresting sea. But it is not I that shall give him convoy, for I have at hand no ships with oars and no men to send him on his way over the broad back of the sea. But with a ready heart will I give him counsel, and will hide naught, that all unscathed he may return to his native land.”	φησί τοι ἄνδρα παρεῖναι ὀιζυρώτατον ἄλλων, τῶν ἀνδρῶν, οἳ ἄστυ πέρι Πριάμοιο μάχοντο εἰνάετες, δεκάτῳ δὲ πόλιν πέρσαντες ἔβησαν οἴκαδʼ· ἀτὰρ ἐν νόστῳ Ἀθηναίην ἀλίτοντο, ἥ σφιν ἐπῶρσʼ ἄνεμόν τε κακὸν καὶ κύματα μακρά.
Then again the messenger Argeiphontes answered her: “Even so send him forth now, and beware of the wrath of Zeus, lest haply he wax wroth and visit his anger upon thee hereafter.” So saying, the strong Argeiphontes departed, and the queenly nymph went to the great-hearted Odysseus,	ἔνθʼ ἄλλοι μὲν πάντες ἀπέφθιθεν ἐσθλοὶ ἑταῖροι, τὸν δʼ ἄρα δεῦρʼ ἄνεμός τε φέρων καὶ κῦμα πέλασσε. τὸν νῦν σʼ ἠνώγειν ἀποπεμπέμεν ὅττι τάχιστα· οὐ γάρ οἱ τῇδʼ αἶσα φίλων ἀπονόσφιν ὀλέσθαι, ἀλλʼ ἔτι οἱ μοῖρʼ ἐστὶ φίλους τʼ ἰδέειν καὶ ἱκέσθαι
 when she had heard the message of Zeus. Him she found sitting on the shore, and his eyes were never dry of tears, and his sweet life was ebbing away, as he longed mournfully for his return, for the nymph was no longer pleasing in his sight. By night indeed he would sleep by her side perforce	οἶκον ἐς ὑψόροφον καὶ ἑὴν ἐς πατρίδα γαῖαν. ὣς φάτο, ῥίγησεν δὲ Καλυψώ, δῖα θεάων, καί μιν φωνήσασʼ ἔπεα πτερόεντα προσηύδα· σχέτλιοί ἐστε, θεοί, ζηλήμονες ἔξοχον ἄλλων, οἵ τε θεαῖς ἀγάασθε παρʼ ἀνδράσιν εὐνάζεσθαι
in the hollow caves, unwilling beside the willing nymph, but by day he would sit on the rocks and the sands, racking his soul with tears and groans and griefs, and he would look over the unresting sea, shedding tears. Then coming close to him, the beautiful goddess addressed him:	ἀμφαδίην, ἤν τίς τε φίλον ποιήσετʼ ἀκοίτην. ὣς μὲν ὅτʼ Ὠρίωνʼ ἕλετο ῥοδοδάκτυλος Ἠώς, τόφρα οἱ ἠγάασθε θεοὶ ῥεῖα ζώοντες, ἧος ἐν Ὀρτυγίῃ χρυσόθρονος Ἄρτεμις ἁγνὴ οἷς ἀγανοῖς βελέεσσιν ἐποιχομένη κατέπεφνεν.
 “Unhappy man, sorrow no longer here, I pray thee, nor let thy life pine away; for even now with a ready heart will I send thee on thy way. Nay, come, hew with the axe long beams, and make a broad raft, and fasten upon it cross-planks for a deck well above it, that it may bear thee over the misty deep.	ὣς δʼ ὁπότʼ Ἰασίωνι ἐυπλόκαμος Δημήτηρ, ᾧ θυμῷ εἴξασα, μίγη φιλότητι καὶ εὐνῇ νειῷ ἔνι τριπόλῳ· οὐδὲ δὴν ἦεν ἄπυστος Ζεύς, ὅς μιν κατέπεφνε βαλὼν ἀργῆτι κεραυνῷ. ὥς δʼ αὖ νῦν μοι ἄγασθε, θεοί, βροτὸν ἄνδρα παρεῖναι.
 And I will place therein bread and water and red wine to satisfy thy heart, to keep hunger from thee. And I will clothe thee with raiment, and will send a fair wind behind thee, that all unscathed thou mayest return to thy native land, if it be the will of the gods who hold broad heaven;	τὸν μὲν ἐγὼν ἐσάωσα περὶ τρόπιος βεβαῶτα οἶον, ἐπεί οἱ νῆα θοὴν ἀργῆτι κεραυνῷ Ζεὺς ἔλσας ἐκέασσε μέσῳ ἐνὶ οἴνοπι πόντῳ. ἔνθʼ ἄλλοι μὲν πάντες ἀπέφθιθεν ἐσθλοὶ ἑταῖροι, τὸν δʼ ἄρα δεῦρʼ ἄνεμός τε φέρων καὶ κῦμα πέλασσε.
for they are mightier than I both to purpose and to fulfil.” So she spoke, and much-enduring goodly Odysseus shuddered, and he spoke, and addressed her with winged words: “Some other thing, goddess, art thou planning in this, and not my sending, seeing that thou biddest me cross on a raft the great gulf of the sea,	τὸν μὲν ἐγὼ φίλεόν τε καὶ ἔτρεφον, ἠδὲ ἔφασκον θήσειν ἀθάνατον καὶ ἀγήραον ἤματα πάντα. ἀλλʼ ἐπεὶ οὔ πως ἔστι Διὸς νόον αἰγιόχοιο οὔτε παρεξελθεῖν ἄλλον θεὸν οὔθʼ ἁλιῶσαι, ἐρρέτω, εἴ μιν κεῖνος ἐποτρύνει καὶ ἀνώγει,
dread and grievous, over which not even the shapely, swift-faring ships pass, rejoicing in the wind of Zeus. But I will not set foot on a raft in thy despite, unless thou, goddess, wilt bring thyself to swear a mighty oath that thou wilt not plot against me any fresh mischief to my hurt.”	πόντον ἐπʼ ἀτρύγετον· πέμψω δέ μιν οὔ πῃ ἐγώ γε· οὐ γάρ μοι πάρα νῆες ἐπήρετμοι καὶ ἑταῖροι, οἵ κέν μιν πέμποιεν ἐπʼ εὐρέα νῶτα θαλάσσης. αὐτάρ οἱ πρόφρων ὑποθήσομαι, οὐδʼ ἐπικεύσω, ὥς κε μάλʼ ἀσκηθὴς ἣν πατρίδα γαῖαν ἵκηται.
 and the down-flowing water of the Styx, which is the greatest and most dread oath for the blessed gods, that I will not plot against thee any fresh mischief to thy hurt. Nay, I have such thoughts in mind, and will give such counsel, as I should devise for mine own self, if such need should come on me.	τὴν δʼ αὖτε προσέειπε διάκτορος ἀργεϊφόντης· οὕτω νῦν ἀπόπεμπε, Διὸς δʼ ἐποπίζεο μῆνιν, μή πώς τοι μετόπισθε κοτεσσάμενος χαλεπήνῃ. ὣς ἄρα φωνήσας ἀπέβη κρατὺς ἀργεϊφόντης· ἡ δʼ ἐπʼ Ὀδυσσῆα μεγαλήτορα πότνια νύμφη
For I too have a mind that is righteous, and the heart in this breast of mine is not of iron, but hath compassion.” So saying, the beautiful goddess led the way quickly, and he followed in the footsteps of the goddess. And they came to the hollow cave, the goddess and the man,	ἤιʼ, ἐπεὶ δὴ Ζηνὸς ἐπέκλυεν ἀγγελιάων. τὸν δʼ ἄρʼ ἐπʼ ἀκτῆς εὗρε καθήμενον· οὐδέ ποτʼ ὄσσε δακρυόφιν τέρσοντο, κατείβετο δὲ γλυκὺς αἰὼν νόστον ὀδυρομένῳ, ἐπεὶ οὐκέτι ἥνδανε νύμφη. ἀλλʼ ἦ τοι νύκτας μὲν ἰαύεσκεν καὶ ἀνάγκῃ
 and he sat down upon the chair from which Hermes had arisen, and the nymph set before him all manner of food to eat and drink, of such sort as mortal men eat. But she herself sat over against divine Odysseus, and before her the handmaids set ambrosia and nectar.	ἐν σπέσσι γλαφυροῖσι παρʼ οὐκ ἐθέλων ἐθελούσῃ· ἤματα δʼ ἂμ πέτρῃσι καὶ ἠιόνεσσι καθίζων δάκρυσι καὶ στοναχῇσι καὶ ἄλγεσι θυμὸν ἐρέχθων πόντον ἐπʼ ἀτρύγετον δερκέσκετο δάκρυα λείβων. ἀγχοῦ δʼ ἱσταμένη προσεφώνεε δῖα θεάων·
So they put forth their hands to the good cheer lying ready before them. But when they had their fill of food and drink, Calypso, the beautiful goddess, was the first to speak, and said: “Son of Laertes, sprung from Zeus, Odysseus of many devices,	κάμμορε, μή μοι ἔτʼ ἐνθάδʼ ὀδύρεο, μηδέ τοι αἰὼν φθινέτω· ἤδη γάρ σε μάλα πρόφρασσʼ ἀποπέμψω. ἀλλʼ ἄγε δούρατα μακρὰ ταμὼν ἁρμόζεο χαλκῷ εὐρεῖαν σχεδίην· ἀτὰρ ἴκρια πῆξαι ἐπʼ αὐτῆς ὑψοῦ, ὥς σε φέρῃσιν ἐπʼ ἠεροειδέα πόντον.
 would'st thou then fare now forthwith home to thy dear native land! Yet, even so fare thee well. Howbeit if in thy heart thou knewest all the measure of woe it is thy fate to fulfil before thou comest to thy native land thou wouldest abide here and keep this house with me, and wouldest be immortal, for all thy desire to see	αὐτὰρ ἐγὼ σῖτον καὶ ὕδωρ καὶ οἶνον ἐρυθρὸν ἐνθήσω μενοεικέʼ, ἅ κέν τοι λιμὸν ἐρύκοι, εἵματά τʼ ἀμφιέσω· πέμψω δέ τοι οὖρον ὄπισθεν, ὥς κε μάλʼ ἀσκηθὴς σὴν πατρίδα γαῖαν ἵκηαι, αἴ κε θεοί γʼ ἐθέλωσι, τοὶ οὐρανὸν εὐρὺν ἔχουσιν,
thy wife for whom thou longest day by day. Surely not inferior to her do I declare myself to be either in form or stature, for in no wise is it seemly that mortal women should vie with immortals in form or comeliness.” Then Odysseus of many wiles answered her, and said:	οἵ μευ φέρτεροί εἰσι νοῆσαί τε κρῆναί τε. ὣς φάτο, ῥίγησεν δὲ πολύτλας δῖος Ὀδυσσεύς, καί μιν φωνήσας ἔπεα πτερόεντα προσηύδα· ἄλλο τι δὴ σύ, θεά, τόδε μήδεαι, οὐδέ τι πομπήν, ἥ με κέλεαι σχεδίῃ περάαν μέγα λαῖτμα θαλάσσης,
 “Mighty goddess, be not wroth with me for this. I know full well of myself that wise Penelope is meaner to look upon than thou in comeliness and in stature, for she is a mortal, while thou art immortal and ageless. But even so I wish and long day by day	δεινόν τʼ ἀργαλέον τε· τὸ δʼ οὐδʼ ἐπὶ νῆες ἐῖσαι ὠκύποροι περόωσιν, ἀγαλλόμεναι Διὸς οὔρῳ. οὐδʼ ἂν ἐγὼν ἀέκητι σέθεν σχεδίης ἐπιβαίην, εἰ μή μοι τλαίης γε, θεά, μέγαν ὅρκον ὀμόσσαι μή τί μοι αὐτῷ πῆμα κακὸν βουλευσέμεν ἄλλο.
to reach my home, and to see the day of my return. And if again some god shall smite me on the wine-dark sea, I will endure it, having in my breast a heart that endures affliction. For ere this I have suffered much and toiled much amid the waves and in war; let this also be added unto that.”	ὣς φάτο, μείδησεν δὲ Καλυψὼ δῖα θεάων, χειρί τέ μιν κατέρεξεν ἔπος τʼ ἔφατʼ ἔκ τʼ ὀνόμαζεν· ἦ δὴ ἀλιτρός γʼ ἐσσὶ καὶ οὐκ ἀποφώλια εἰδώς, οἷον δὴ τὸν μῦθον ἐπεφράσθης ἀγορεῦσαι. ἴστω νῦν τόδε γαῖα καὶ οὐρανὸς εὐρὺς ὕπερθε
So he spoke, and the sun set and darkness came on. And the two went into the innermost recess of the hollow cave, and took their joy of love, abiding each by the other's side. As soon as early Dawn appeared, the rosy-fingered, straightway Odysseus put on a cloak and a tunic,	καὶ τὸ κατειβόμενον Στυγὸς ὕδωρ, ὅς τε μέγιστος ὅρκος δεινότατός τε πέλει μακάρεσσι θεοῖσι, μή τί τοι αὐτῷ πῆμα κακὸν βουλευσέμεν ἄλλο. ἀλλὰ τὰ μὲν νοέω καὶ φράσσομαι, ἅσσʼ ἂν ἐμοί περ αὐτῇ μηδοίμην, ὅτε με χρειὼ τόσον ἵκοι·
 and the nymph clothed herself in a long white robe, finely woven and beautiful, and about her waist she cast a fair girdle of gold, and on her head a veil above. Then she set herself to plan the sending of the great-hearted Odysseus. She gave him a great axe, well fitted to his hands,	καὶ γὰρ ἐμοὶ νόος ἐστὶν ἐναίσιμος, οὐδέ μοι αὐτῇ θυμὸς ἐνὶ στήθεσσι σιδήρεος, ἀλλʼ ἐλεήμων. ὣς ἄρα φωνήσασʼ ἡγήσατο δῖα θεάων καρπαλίμως· ὁ δʼ ἔπειτα μετʼ ἴχνια βαῖνε θεοῖο. ἷξον δὲ σπεῖος γλαφυρὸν θεὸς ἠδὲ καὶ ἀνήρ,
 an axe of bronze, sharpened on both sides; and in it was a beautiful handle of olive wood, securely fastened; and thereafter she gave him a polished adze. Then she led the way to the borders of the island where tall trees were standing, alder and popular and fir, reaching to the skies,	καί ῥʼ ὁ μὲν ἔνθα καθέζετʼ ἐπὶ θρόνου ἔνθεν ἀνέστη Ἑρμείας, νύμφη δʼ ἐτίθει πάρα πᾶσαν ἐδωδήν, ἔσθειν καὶ πίνειν, οἷα βροτοὶ ἄνδρες ἔδουσιν· αὐτὴ δʼ ἀντίον ἷζεν Ὀδυσσῆος θείοιο, τῇ δὲ παρʼ ἀμβροσίην δμῳαὶ καὶ νέκταρ ἔθηκαν.
 long dry and well-seasoned, which would float for him lightly. But when she had shewn him where the tall trees grew, Calypso, the beautiful goddess, returned homewards, but he fell to cutting timbers, and his work went forward apace. Twenty trees in all did he fell, and trimmed them with the axe;	οἱ δʼ ἐπʼ ὀνείαθʼ ἑτοῖμα προκείμενα χεῖρας ἴαλλον. αὐτὰρ ἐπεὶ τάρπησαν ἐδητύος ἠδὲ ποτῆτος, τοῖς ἄρα μύθων ἦρχε Καλυψώ, δῖα θεάων· διογενὲς Λαερτιάδη, πολυμήχανʼ Ὀδυσσεῦ, οὕτω δὴ οἶκόνδε φίλην ἐς πατρίδα γαῖαν
 then he cunningly smoothed them all and made them straight to the line. Meanwhile Calypso, the beautiful goddess, brought him augers; and he bored all the pieces and fitted them to one another, and with pegs and morticings did he hammer it together. Wide as a man well-skilled in carpentry marks out the curve of the hull of a freight-ship,	αὐτίκα νῦν ἐθέλεις ἰέναι; σὺ δὲ χαῖρε καὶ ἔμπης. εἴ γε μὲν εἰδείης σῇσι φρεσὶν ὅσσα τοι αἶσα κήδεʼ ἀναπλῆσαι, πρὶν πατρίδα γαῖαν ἱκέσθαι, ἐνθάδε κʼ αὖθι μένων σὺν ἐμοὶ τόδε δῶμα φυλάσσοις ἀθάνατός τʼ εἴης, ἱμειρόμενός περ ἰδέσθαι
 broad of beam, even so wide did Odysseus make his raft. And he set up the deck-beams, bolting them to the close-set ribs, and laboured on; and he finished the raft with long gunwales. In it he set a mast and a yard-arm, fitted to it,	σὴν ἄλοχον, τῆς τʼ αἰὲν ἐέλδεαι ἤματα πάντα. οὐ μέν θην κείνης γε χερείων εὔχομαι εἶναι, οὐ δέμας οὐδὲ φυήν, ἐπεὶ οὔ πως οὐδὲ ἔοικεν θνητὰς ἀθανάτῃσι δέμας καὶ εἶδος ἐρίζειν. τὴν δʼ ἀπαμειβόμενος προσέφη πολύμητις Ὀδυσσεύς·
and furthermore made him a steering-oar, wherewith to steer. Then he fenced in the whole from stem to stern with willow withes to be a defence against the wave, and strewed much brush thereon. Meanwhile Calypso, the beautiful goddess, brought him cloth to make him a sail, and he fashioned that too with skill.	πότνα θεά, μή μοι τόδε χώεο· οἶδα καὶ αὐτὸς πάντα μάλʼ, οὕνεκα σεῖο περίφρων Πηνελόπεια εἶδος ἀκιδνοτέρη μέγεθός τʼ εἰσάντα ἰδέσθαι· ἡ μὲν γὰρ βροτός ἐστι, σὺ δʼ ἀθάνατος καὶ ἀγήρως. ἀλλὰ καὶ ὣς ἐθέλω καὶ ἐέλδομαι ἤματα πάντα
And he made fast in the raft braces and halyards and sheets, and then with levers forced it down into the bright sea. Now the fourth day came and all his work was done. And on the fifth the beautiful Calypso sent him on his way from the island after she had bathed him and clothed him in fragrant raiment.	οἴκαδέ τʼ ἐλθέμεναι καὶ νόστιμον ἦμαρ ἰδέσθαι. εἰ δʼ αὖ τις ῥαίῃσι θεῶν ἐνὶ οἴνοπι πόντῳ, τλήσομαι ἐν στήθεσσιν ἔχων ταλαπενθέα θυμόν· ἤδη γὰρ μάλα πολλὰ πάθον καὶ πολλὰ μόγησα κύμασι καὶ πολέμῳ· μετὰ καὶ τόδε τοῖσι γενέσθω.
 On the raft the goddess put a skin of dark wine, and another, a great one, of water, and provisions, too, in a wallet. Therein she put abundance of dainties to satisfy his heart, and she sent forth a gentle wind and warm. Gladly then did goodly Odysseus spread his sail to the breeze;	ὣς ἔφατʼ, ἠέλιος δʼ ἄρʼ ἔδυ καὶ ἐπὶ κνέφας ἦλθεν· ἐλθόντες δʼ ἄρα τώ γε μυχῷ σπείους γλαφυροῖο τερπέσθην φιλότητι, παρʼ ἀλλήλοισι μένοντες. ἦμος δʼ ἠριγένεια φάνη ῥοδοδάκτυλος Ἠώς, αὐτίχʼ ὁ μὲν χλαῖνάν τε χιτῶνά τε ἕννυτʼ Ὀδυσσεύς,
 and he sat and guided his raft skilfully with the steering-oar, nor did sleep fall upon his eyelids, as he watched the Pleiads, and late-setting Bootes, and the Bear, which men also call the Wain, which ever circles where it is and watches Orion,	αὐτὴ δʼ ἀργύφεον φᾶρος μέγα ἕννυτο νύμφη, λεπτὸν καὶ χαρίεν, περὶ δὲ ζώνην βάλετʼ ἰξυῖ καλὴν χρυσείην, κεφαλῇ δʼ ἐφύπερθε καλύπτρην. καὶ τότʼ Ὀδυσσῆι μεγαλήτορι μήδετο πομπήν· δῶκέν οἱ πέλεκυν μέγαν, ἄρμενον ἐν παλάμῃσι,
 and alone has no part in the baths of Ocean. For this star Calypso, the beautiful goddess, had bidden him to keep on the left hand as he sailed over the sea. For seventeen days then he sailed over the sea, and on the eighteenth appeared the shadowy mountains	χάλκεον, ἀμφοτέρωθεν ἀκαχμένον· αὐτὰρ ἐν αὐτῷ στειλειὸν περικαλλὲς ἐλάινον, εὖ ἐναρηρός· δῶκε δʼ ἔπειτα σκέπαρνον ἐύξοον· ἦρχε δʼ ὁδοῖο νήσου ἐπʼ ἐσχατιῆς, ὅθι δένδρεα μακρὰ πεφύκει, κλήθρη τʼ αἴγειρός τʼ, ἐλάτη τʼ ἦν οὐρανομήκης,
of the land of the Phaeacians, where it lay nearest to him; and it shewed like unto a shield in the misty deep. But the glorious Earth-shaker, as he came back from the Ethiopians, beheld him from afar, from the mountains of the Solymi: for Odysseus was seen of him sailing over the sea; and he waxed the more wroth in spirit,	αὖα πάλαι, περίκηλα, τά οἱ πλώοιεν ἐλαφρῶς. αὐτὰρ ἐπεὶ δὴ δεῖξʼ, ὅθι δένδρεα μακρὰ πεφύκει, ἡ μὲν ἔβη πρὸς δῶμα Καλυψώ, δῖα θεάων, αὐτὰρ ὁ τάμνετο δοῦρα· θοῶς δέ οἱ ἤνυτο ἔργον. εἴκοσι δʼ ἔκβαλε πάντα, πελέκκησεν δʼ ἄρα χαλκῷ,
and shook his head, and thus he spoke to his own heart: “Out on it! Surely the gods have changed their purpose regarding Odysseus, while I was among the Ethiopians. And lo, he is near to the land of the Phaeacians, where it is his fate to escape from the great bonds of the woe which has come upon him.	ξέσσε δʼ ἐπισταμένως καὶ ἐπὶ στάθμην ἴθυνεν. τόφρα δʼ ἔνεικε τέρετρα Καλυψώ, δῖα θεάων· τέτρηνεν δʼ ἄρα πάντα καὶ ἥρμοσεν ἀλλήλοισιν, γόμφοισιν δʼ ἄρα τήν γε καὶ ἁρμονίῃσιν ἄρασσεν. ὅσσον τίς τʼ ἔδαφος νηὸς τορνώσεται ἀνὴρ
Aye, but even yet, methinks, I shall drive him to surfeit of evil.” So saying, he gathered the clouds, and seizing his trident in his hands troubled the sea, and roused all blasts of all manner of winds, and hid with clouds land and sea alike; and night rushed down from heaven.	φορτίδος εὐρείης, ἐὺ εἰδὼς τεκτοσυνάων, τόσσον ἔπʼ εὐρεῖαν σχεδίην ποιήσατʼ Ὀδυσσεύς. ἴκρια δὲ στήσας, ἀραρὼν θαμέσι σταμίνεσσι, ποίει· ἀτὰρ μακρῇσιν ἐπηγκενίδεσσι τελεύτα. ἐν δʼ ἱστὸν ποίει καὶ ἐπίκριον ἄρμενον αὐτῷ·
Together the East Wind and the South Wind dashed, and the fierce-blowing West Wind and the North Wind , born in the bright heaven, rolling before him a mighty wave. Then were the knees of Odysseus loosened and his heart melted, and deeply moved he spoke to his own mighty spirit: “Ah me, wretched that I am! What is to befall me at the last?	πρὸς δʼ ἄρα πηδάλιον ποιήσατο, ὄφρʼ ἰθύνοι. φράξε δέ μιν ῥίπεσσι διαμπερὲς οἰσυΐνῃσι κύματος εἶλαρ ἔμεν· πολλὴν δʼ ἐπεχεύατο ὕλην. τόφρα δὲ φάρεʼ ἔνεικε Καλυψώ, δῖα θεάων, ἱστία ποιήσασθαι· ὁ δʼ εὖ τεχνήσατο καὶ τά.
 I fear me that verily all that the goddess said was true, when she declared that on the sea, before ever I came to my native land, I should fill up my measure of woes; and lo, all this now is being brought to pass. In such wise does Zeus overcast the broad heaven with clouds, and has stirred up the sea, and the blasts	ἐν δʼ ὑπέρας τε κάλους τε πόδας τʼ ἐνέδησεν ἐν αὐτῇ, μοχλοῖσιν δʼ ἄρα τήν γε κατείρυσεν εἰς ἅλα δῖαν. τέτρατον ἦμαρ ἔην, καὶ τῷ τετέλεστο ἅπαντα· τῷ δʼ ἄρα πέμπτῳ πέμπʼ ἀπὸ νήσου δῖα Καλυψώ, εἵματά τʼ ἀμφιέσασα θυώδεα καὶ λούσασα.
of all manner of winds sweep upon me; now is my utter destruction sure. Thrice blessed those Danaans, aye, four times blessed, who of old perished in the wide land of Troy , doing the pleasure of the sons of Atreus. Even so would that I had died and met my fate on that day when the throngs	ἐν δέ οἱ ἀσκὸν ἔθηκε θεὰ μέλανος οἴνοιο τὸν ἕτερον, ἕτερον δʼ ὕδατος μέγαν, ἐν δὲ καὶ ᾖα κωρύκῳ· ἐν δέ οἱ ὄψα τίθει μενοεικέα πολλά· οὖρον δὲ προέηκεν ἀπήμονά τε λιαρόν τε. γηθόσυνος δʼ οὔρῳ πέτασʼ ἱστία δῖος Ὀδυσσεύς.
of the Trojans hurled upon me bronze-tipped spears, fighting around the body of the dead son of Peleus. Then should I have got funeral rites, and the Achaeans would have spread my fame, but now by a miserable death was it appointed me to be cut off.” Even as thus he spoke the great wave smote him from on high, rushing upon him with terrible might, and around it whirled his raft.	αὐτὰρ ὁ πηδαλίῳ ἰθύνετο τεχνηέντως ἥμενος, οὐδέ οἱ ὕπνος ἐπὶ βλεφάροισιν ἔπιπτεν Πληιάδας τʼ ἐσορῶντι καὶ ὀψὲ δύοντα Βοώτην Ἄρκτον θʼ, ἣν καὶ ἄμαξαν ἐπίκλησιν καλέουσιν, ἥ τʼ αὐτοῦ στρέφεται καί τʼ Ὠρίωνα δοκεύει,
 Far from the raft he fell, and let fall the steering-oar from his hand; but his mast was broken in the midst by the fierce blast of tumultuous winds that came upon it, and far in the sea sail and yardarm fell. As for him, long time did the wave hold him in the depths, nor could he	οἴη δʼ ἄμμορός ἐστι λοετρῶν Ὠκεανοῖο· τὴν γὰρ δή μιν ἄνωγε Καλυψώ, δῖα θεάων, ποντοπορευέμεναι ἐπʼ ἀριστερὰ χειρὸς ἔχοντα. ἑπτὰ δὲ καὶ δέκα μὲν πλέεν ἤματα ποντοπορεύων, ὀκτωκαιδεκάτῃ δʼ ἐφάνη ὄρεα σκιόεντα
 rise at once from beneath the onrush of the mighty wave, for the garments which beautiful Calypso had given him weighed him down. At length, however, he came up, and spat forth from his mouth the bitter brine which flowed in streams from his head. Yet even so he did not forget his raft, in evil case though he was,	γαίης Φαιήκων, ὅθι τʼ ἄγχιστον πέλεν αὐτῷ· εἴσατο δʼ ὡς ὅτε ῥινὸν ἐν ἠεροειδέι πόντῳ. τὸν δʼ ἐξ Αἰθιόπων ἀνιὼν κρείων ἐνοσίχθων τηλόθεν ἐκ Σολύμων ὀρέων ἴδεν· εἴσατο γάρ οἱ πόντον ἐπιπλώων. ὁ δʼ ἐχώσατο κηρόθι μᾶλλον,
but sprang after it amid the waves, and laid hold of it, and sat down in the midst of it, seeking to escape the doom of death; and a great wave ever bore him this way and that along its course. As when in autumn the North Wind bears the thistle-tufts over the plain, and close they cling to one another,	κινήσας δὲ κάρη προτὶ ὃν μυθήσατο θυμόν· ὢ πόποι, ἦ μάλα δὴ μετεβούλευσαν θεοὶ ἄλλως ἀμφʼ Ὀδυσῆι ἐμεῖο μετʼ Αἰθιόπεσσιν ἐόντος, καὶ δὴ Φαιήκων γαίης σχεδόν, ἔνθα οἱ αἶσα ἐκφυγέειν μέγα πεῖραρ ὀιζύος, ἥ μιν ἱκάνει.
so did the winds bear the raft this way and that over the sea. Now the South Wind would fling it to the North Wind to be driven on, and now again the East Wind would yield it to the West Wind to drive. But the daughter of Cadmus , Ino of the fair ankles, saw him, even Leucothea, who of old was a mortal of human speech,	ἀλλʼ ἔτι μέν μίν φημι ἅδην ἐλάαν κακότητος. ὣς εἰπὼν σύναγεν νεφέλας, ἐτάραξε δὲ πόντον χερσὶ τρίαιναν ἑλών· πάσας δʼ ὀρόθυνεν ἀέλλας παντοίων ἀνέμων, σὺν δὲ νεφέεσσι κάλυψε γαῖαν ὁμοῦ καὶ πόντον· ὀρώρει δʼ οὐρανόθεν νύξ.
but now in the deeps of the sea has won a share of honor from the gods. She was touched with pity for Odysseus, as he wandered and was in sore travail, and she rose up from the deep like a sea-mew on the wing, and sat on the stoutly-bound raft, and spoke, saying: “Unhappy man, how is it that Poseidon, the earth-shaker,	σὺν δʼ Εὖρός τε Νότος τʼ ἔπεσον Ζέφυρός τε δυσαὴς καὶ Βορέης αἰθρηγενέτης, μέγα κῦμα κυλίνδων. καὶ τότʼ Ὀδυσσῆος λύτο γούνατα καὶ φίλον ἦτορ, ὀχθήσας δʼ ἄρα εἶπε πρὸς ὃν μεγαλήτορα θυμόν· ὤ μοι ἐγὼ δειλός, τί νύ μοι μήκιστα γένηται;
 has conceived such furious wrath against thee, that he is sowing for thee the seeds of many evils? Yet verily he shall not utterly destroy thee for all his rage. Nay, do thou thus; and methinks thou dost not lack understanding. Strip off these garments, and leave thy raft to be driven by the winds, but do thou swim with thy hands and so strive to reach	δείδω μὴ δὴ πάντα θεὰ νημερτέα εἶπεν, ἥ μʼ ἔφατʼ ἐν πόντῳ, πρὶν πατρίδα γαῖαν ἱκέσθαι, ἄλγεʼ ἀναπλήσειν· τὰ δὲ δὴ νῦν πάντα τελεῖται. οἵοισιν νεφέεσσι περιστέφει οὐρανὸν εὐρὺν Ζεύς, ἐτάραξε δὲ πόντον, ἐπισπέρχουσι δʼ ἄελλαι
 the land of the Phaeacians, where it is thy fate to escape. Come, take this veil, and stretch it beneath thy breast. It is immortal; there is no fear that thou shalt suffer aught or perish. But when with thy hands thou hast laid hold of the land, loose it from thee, and cast it into the wine-dark sea	παντοίων ἀνέμων. νῦν μοι σῶς αἰπὺς ὄλεθρος. τρὶς μάκαρες Δαναοὶ καὶ τετράκις, οἳ τότʼ ὄλοντο Τροίῃ ἐν εὐρείῃ χάριν Ἀτρεΐδῃσι φέροντες. ὡς δὴ ἐγώ γʼ ὄφελον θανέειν καὶ πότμον ἐπισπεῖν ἤματι τῷ ὅτε μοι πλεῖστοι χαλκήρεα δοῦρα
far from the land, and thyself turn away.” So saying, the goddess gave him the veil, and herself plunged again into the surging deep, like a sea-mew; and the dark wave hid her. Then the much-enduring, goodly Odysseus pondered,	Τρῶες ἐπέρριψαν περὶ Πηλεΐωνι θανόντι. τῷ κʼ ἔλαχον κτερέων, καί μευ κλέος ἦγον Ἀχαιοί· νῦν δέ λευγαλέῳ θανάτῳ εἵμαρτο ἁλῶναι. ὣς ἄρα μιν εἰπόντʼ ἔλασεν μέγα κῦμα κατʼ ἄκρης δεινὸν ἐπεσσύμενον, περὶ δὲ σχεδίην ἐλέλιξε.
and deeply moved he spoke to his own mighty spirit: “Woe is me! Let it not be that some one of the immortals is again weaving a snare for me, that she bids me leave my raft. Nay, but verily I will not yet obey, for afar off mine eyes beheld the land, where she said I was to escape.	τῆλε δʼ ἀπὸ σχεδίης αὐτὸς πέσε, πηδάλιον δὲ ἐκ χειρῶν προέηκε· μέσον δέ οἱ ἱστὸν ἔαξεν δεινὴ μισγομένων ἀνέμων ἐλθοῦσα θύελλα, τηλοῦ δὲ σπεῖρον καὶ ἐπίκριον ἔμπεσε πόντῳ. τὸν δʼ ἄρʼ ὑπόβρυχα θῆκε πολὺν χρόνον, οὐδʼ ἐδυνάσθη
But this will I do, and meseems that this is best: as long as the timbers hold firm in their fastenings, so long will I remain here and endure to suffer affliction; but when the wave shall have shattered the raft to pieces, I will swim, seeing that there is naught better to devise.”	αἶψα μάλʼ ἀνσχεθέειν μεγάλου ὑπὸ κύματος ὁρμῆς· εἵματα γάρ ῥʼ ἐβάρυνε, τά οἱ πόρε δῖα Καλυψώ. ὀψὲ δὲ δή ῥʼ ἀνέδυ, στόματος δʼ ἐξέπτυσεν ἅλμην πικρήν, ἥ οἱ πολλὴ ἀπὸ κρατὸς κελάρυζεν. ἀλλʼ οὐδʼ ὣς σχεδίης ἐπελήθετο, τειρόμενός περ,
 While he pondered thus in mind and heart, Poseidon, the earth-shaker, made to rise up a great wave, dread and grievous, arching over from above, and drove it upon him. And as when a strong wind tosses a heap of straw that is dry, and some it scatters here, some there,	ἀλλὰ μεθορμηθεὶς ἐνὶ κύμασιν ἐλλάβετʼ αὐτῆς, ἐν μέσσῃ δὲ καθῖζε τέλος θανάτου ἀλεείνων. τὴν δʼ ἐφόρει μέγα κῦμα κατὰ ῥόον ἔνθα καὶ ἔνθα. ὡς δʼ ὅτʼ ὀπωρινὸς Βορέης φορέῃσιν ἀκάνθας ἂμ πεδίον, πυκιναὶ δὲ πρὸς ἀλλήλῃσιν ἔχονται,
 even so the wave scattered the long timbers of the raft. But Odysseus bestrode one plank, as though he were riding a horse, and stripped off the garments which beautiful Calypso had given him. Then straightway he stretched the veil beneath his breast, and flung himself headlong into the sea with hands outstretched,	ὣς τὴν ἂμ πέλαγος ἄνεμοι φέρον ἔνθα καὶ ἔνθα· ἄλλοτε μέν τε Νότος Βορέῃ προβάλεσκε φέρεσθαι, ἄλλοτε δʼ αὖτʼ Εὖρος Ζεφύρῳ εἴξασκε διώκειν. τὸν δὲ ἴδεν Κάδμου θυγάτηρ, καλλίσφυρος Ἰνώ, Λευκοθέη, ἣ πρὶν μὲν ἔην βροτὸς αὐδήεσσα,
ready to swim. And the lord, the earth-shaker, saw him, and he shook his head, and thus he spoke to his own heart: “So now, after thou hast suffered many ills, go wandering over the deep, till thou comest among the folk fostered of Zeus. Yet even so, methinks, thou shalt not make any mock at thy suffering.”	νῦν δʼ ἁλὸς ἐν πελάγεσσι θεῶν ἒξ ἔμμορε τιμῆς. ἥ ῥʼ Ὀδυσῆʼ ἐλέησεν ἀλώμενον, ἄλγεʼ ἔχοντα, αἰθυίῃ δʼ ἐικυῖα ποτῇ ἀνεδύσετο λίμνης, ἷζε δʼ ἐπὶ σχεδίης πολυδέσμου εἶπέ τε μῦθον· κάμμορε, τίπτε τοι ὧδε Ποσειδάων ἐνοσίχθων
So saying, he lashed his fair-maned horses, and came to Aegae , where is his glorious palace. But Athena, daughter of Zeus, took other counsel. She stayed the paths of the other winds, and bade them all cease and be lulled to rest;	ὠδύσατʼ ἐκπάγλως, ὅτι τοι κακὰ πολλὰ φυτεύει; οὐ μὲν δή σε καταφθίσει μάλα περ μενεαίνων. ἀλλὰ μάλʼ ὧδʼ ἔρξαι, δοκέεις δέ μοι οὐκ ἀπινύσσειν· εἵματα ταῦτʼ ἀποδὺς σχεδίην ἀνέμοισι φέρεσθαι κάλλιπʼ, ἀτὰρ χείρεσσι νέων ἐπιμαίεο νόστου
but she roused the swift North Wind , and broke the waves before him, to the end that Zeus-born Odysseus might come among the Phaeacians, lovers of the oar, escaping from death and the fates. Then for two nights and two days he was driven about over the swollen waves, and full often his heart forboded destruction.	γαίης Φαιήκων, ὅθι τοι μοῖρʼ ἐστὶν ἀλύξαι. τῆ δέ, τόδε κρήδεμνον ὑπὸ στέρνοιο τανύσσαι ἄμβροτον· οὐδέ τί τοι παθέειν δέος οὐδʼ ἀπολέσθαι. αὐτὰρ ἐπὴν χείρεσσιν ἐφάψεαι ἠπείροιο, ἂψ ἀπολυσάμενος βαλέειν εἰς οἴνοπα πόντον
 But when fair-tressed Dawn brought to its birth the third day, then the wind ceased and there was a windless calm, and he caught sight of the shore close at hand, casting a quick glance forward, as he was raised up by a great wave. And even as when most welcome to his children appears the life	πολλὸν ἀπʼ ἠπείρου, αὐτὸς δʼ ἀπονόσφι τραπέσθαι. ὣς ἄρα φωνήσασα θεὰ κρήδεμνον ἔδωκεν, αὐτὴ δʼ ἂψ ἐς πόντον ἐδύσετο κυμαίνοντα αἰθυίῃ ἐικυῖα· μέλαν δέ ἑ κῦμα κάλυψεν. αὐτὰρ ὁ μερμήριξε πολύτλας δῖος Ὀδυσσεύς,
 of a father who lies in sickness, bearing grievous pains, long while wasting away, and some cruel god assails him, but then to their joy the gods free him from his woe, so to Odysseus did the land and the wood seem welcome; and he swam on, eager to set foot on the land.	ὀχθήσας δʼ ἄρα εἶπε πρὸς ὃν μεγαλήτορα θυμόν· ὤ μοι ἐγώ, μή τίς μοι ὑφαίνῃσιν δόλον αὖτε ἀθανάτων, ὅ τέ με σχεδίης ἀποβῆναι ἀνώγει. ἀλλὰ μάλʼ οὔ πω πείσομʼ, ἐπεὶ ἑκὰς ὀφθαλμοῖσιν γαῖαν ἐγὼν ἰδόμην, ὅθι μοι φάτο φύξιμον εἶναι.
 But when he was as far away as a man's voice carries when he shouts, and heard the boom of the sea upon the reefs—for the great wave thundered against the dry land, belching upon it in terrible fashion, and all things were wrapped in the foam of the sea; for there were neither harbors where ships might ride, nor road-steads,	ἀλλὰ μάλʼ ὧδʼ ἔρξω, δοκέει δέ μοι εἶναι ἄριστον· ὄφρʼ ἂν μέν κεν δούρατʼ ἐν ἁρμονίῃσιν ἀρήρῃ, τόφρʼ αὐτοῦ μενέω καὶ τλήσομαι ἄλγεα πάσχων· αὐτὰρ ἐπὴν δή μοι σχεδίην διὰ κῦμα τινάξῃ, νήξομʼ, ἐπεὶ οὐ μέν τι πάρα προνοῆσαι ἄμεινον.
but projecting headlands, and reefs, and cliffs—then the knees of Odysseus were loosened and his heart melted, and deeply moved he spoke to his own mighty spirit: “Ah me, when Zeus has at length granted me to see the land beyond my hopes, and lo, I have prevailed to cleave my way and to cross this gulf,	ἧος ὁ ταῦθʼ ὥρμαινε κατὰ φρένα καὶ κατὰ θυμόν, ὦρσε δʼ ἐπὶ μέγα κῦμα Ποσειδάων ἐνοσίχθων, δεινόν τʼ ἀργαλέον τε, κατηρεφές, ἤλασε δʼ αὐτόν. ὡς δʼ ἄνεμος ζαὴς ἠΐων θημῶνα τινάξῃ καρφαλέων· τὰ μὲν ἄρ τε διεσκέδασʼ ἄλλυδις ἄλλῃ·
 nowhere doth there appear a way to come forth from the grey sea. For without are sharp crags, and around them the wave roars foaming, and the rock runs up sheer, and the water is deep close in shore, so that in no wise is it possible to plant both feet firmly and escape ruin.	ὣς τῆς δούρατα μακρὰ διεσκέδασʼ. αὐτὰρ Ὀδυσσεὺς ἀμφʼ ἑνὶ δούρατι βαῖνε, κέληθʼ ὡς ἵππον ἐλαύνων, εἵματα δʼ ἐξαπέδυνε, τά οἱ πόρε δῖα Καλυψώ. αὐτίκα δὲ κρήδεμνον ὑπὸ στέρνοιο τάνυσσεν, αὐτὸς δὲ πρηνὴς ἁλὶ κάππεσε, χεῖρε πετάσσας,
Haply were I to seek to land, a great wave may seize me and dash me against the jagged rock, and so shall my striving be in vain. But if I swim on yet further in hope to find shelving beaches and harbors of the sea, I fear me lest the storm-wind may catch me up again,	νηχέμεναι μεμαώς. ἴδε δὲ κρείων ἐνοσίχθων, κινήσας δὲ κάρη προτὶ ὃν μυθήσατο θυμόν· οὕτω νῦν κακὰ πολλὰ παθὼν ἀλόω κατὰ πόντον, εἰς ὅ κεν ἀνθρώποισι διοτρεφέεσσι μιγήῃς. ἀλλʼ οὐδʼ ὥς σε ἔολπα ὀνόσσεσθαι κακότητος.
and bear me, groaning heavily, over the teeming deep; or lest some god may even send forth upon me some great monster from out the sea—and many such does glorious Amphitrite breed. For I know that the glorious Earth-shaker is filled with wrath against me.” While he pondered thus in mind and heart,	ὣς ἄρα φωνήσας ἵμασεν καλλίτριχας ἵππους, ἵκετο δʼ εἰς Αἰγάς, ὅθι οἱ κλυτὰ δώματʼ ἔασιν. αὐτὰρ Ἀθηναίη κούρη Διὸς ἄλλʼ ἐνόησεν. ἦ τοι τῶν ἄλλων ἀνέμων κατέδησε κελεύθους, παύσασθαι δʼ ἐκέλευσε καὶ εὐνηθῆναι ἅπαντας·
 a great wave bore him against the rugged shore. There would his skin have been stripped off and his bones broken, had not the goddess, flashing-eyed Athena, put a thought in his mind. On he rushed and seized the rock with both hands, and clung to it, groaning, until the great wave went by.	ὦρσε δʼ ἐπὶ κραιπνὸν Βορέην, πρὸ δὲ κύματʼ ἔαξεν, ἧος ὃ Φαιήκεσσι φιληρέτμοισι μιγείη διογενὴς Ὀδυσεὺς θάνατον καὶ κῆρας ἀλύξας. ἔνθα δύω νύκτας δύο τʼ ἤματα κύματι πηγῷ πλάζετο, πολλὰ δέ οἱ κραδίη προτιόσσετʼ ὄλεθρον.
 Thus then did he escape this wave, but in its backward flow it once more rushed upon him and smote him, and flung him far out in the sea. And just as, when a cuttlefish is dragged from its hole, many pebbles cling to its suckers, even so from his strong hands	ἀλλʼ ὅτε δὴ τρίτον ἦμαρ ἐυπλόκαμος τέλεσʼ Ἠώς, καὶ τότʼ ἔπειτʼ ἄνεμος μὲν ἐπαύσατο ἠδὲ γαλήνη ἔπλετο νηνεμίη· ὁ δʼ ἄρα σχεδὸν εἴσιδε γαῖαν ὀξὺ μάλα προϊδών, μεγάλου ὑπὸ κύματος ἀρθείς. ὡς δʼ ὅτʼ ἂν ἀσπάσιος βίοτος παίδεσσι φανήῃ
 were bits of skin stripped off against the rocks; and the great wave covered him. Then verily would hapless Odysseus have perished beyond his fate, had not flashing-eyed Athena given him prudence. Making his way forth from the surge where it belched upon the shore, he swam outside, looking ever toward the land in hope to find	πατρός, ὃς ἐν νούσῳ κεῖται κρατέρʼ ἄλγεα πάσχων, δηρὸν τηκόμενος, στυγερὸς δέ οἱ ἔχραε δαίμων, ἀσπάσιον δʼ ἄρα τόν γε θεοὶ κακότητος ἔλυσαν, ὣς Ὀδυσεῖ ἀσπαστὸν ἐείσατο γαῖα καὶ ὕλη, νῆχε δʼ ἐπειγόμενος ποσὶν ἠπείρου ἐπιβῆναι.
shelving beaches and harbors of the sea. But when, as he swam, he came to the mouth of a fair-flowing river, where seemed to him the best place, since it was smooth of stones, and besides there was shelter from the wind, he knew the river as he flowed forth, and prayed to him in his heart:	ἀλλʼ ὅτε τόσσον ἀπῆν ὅσσον τε γέγωνε βοήσας, καὶ δὴ δοῦπον ἄκουσε ποτὶ σπιλάδεσσι θαλάσσης· ῥόχθει γὰρ μέγα κῦμα ποτὶ ξερὸν ἠπείροιο δεινὸν ἐρευγόμενον, εἴλυτο δὲ πάνθʼ ἁλὸς ἄχνῃ· οὐ γὰρ ἔσαν λιμένες νηῶν ὄχοι, οὐδʼ ἐπιωγαί.
“Hear me, O king, whosoever thou art. As to one greatly longed-for do I come to thee, seeking to escape from out the sea from the threats of Poseidon. Reverend even in the eyes of the immortal gods is that man who comes as a wanderer, even as I have now come to thy stream and to thy knees, after many toils.	ἀλλʼ ἀκταὶ προβλῆτες ἔσαν σπιλάδες τε πάγοι τε· καὶ τότʼ Ὀδυσσῆος λύτο γούνατα καὶ φίλον ἦτορ, ὀχθήσας δʼ ἄρα εἶπε πρὸς ὃν μεγαλήτορα θυμόν· ὤ μοι, ἐπεὶ δὴ γαῖαν ἀελπέα δῶκεν ἰδέσθαι Ζεύς, καὶ δὴ τόδε λαῖτμα διατμήξας ἐπέρησα,
Nay, pity me, O king, for I declare that I am thy suppliant.” So he spoke, and the god straightway stayed his stream, and checked the waves, and made a calm before him, and brought him safely to the mouth of the river. And he let his two knees bend and his strong hands fall, for his spirit was crushed by the sea.	ἔκβασις οὔ πῃ φαίνεθʼ ἁλὸς πολιοῖο θύραζε· ἔκτοσθεν μὲν γὰρ πάγοι ὀξέες, ἀμφὶ δὲ κῦμα βέβρυχεν ῥόθιον, λισσὴ δʼ ἀναδέδρομε πέτρη, ἀγχιβαθὴς δὲ θάλασσα, καὶ οὔ πως ἔστι πόδεσσι στήμεναι ἀμφοτέροισι καὶ ἐκφυγέειν κακότητα·
 And all his flesh was swollen, and sea water flowed in streams up through his mouth and nostrils. So he lay breathless and speechless, with scarce strength to move; for terrible weariness had come upon him. But when he revived, and his spirit returned again into his breast, then he loosed from him the veil of the goddess and let it fall into the river that murmured seaward;	μή πώς μʼ ἐκβαίνοντα βάλῃ λίθακι ποτὶ πέτρῃ κῦμα μέγʼ ἁρπάξαν· μελέη δέ μοι ἔσσεται ὁρμή. εἰ δέ κʼ ἔτι προτέρω παρανήξομαι, ἤν που ἐφεύρω ἠιόνας τε παραπλῆγας λιμένας τε θαλάσσης, δείδω μή μʼ ἐξαῦτις ἀναρπάξασα θύελλα
and the great wave bore it back down the stream, and straightway Ino received it in her hands. But Odysseus, going back from the river, sank down in the reeds and kissed the earth, the giver of grain; and deeply moved he spoke to his own mighty spirit:	πόντον ἐπʼ ἰχθυόεντα φέρῃ βαρέα στενάχοντα, ἠέ τί μοι καὶ κῆτος ἐπισσεύῃ μέγα δαίμων ἐξ ἁλός, οἷά τε πολλὰ τρέφει κλυτὸς Ἀμφιτρίτη· οἶδα γάρ, ὥς μοι ὀδώδυσται κλυτὸς ἐννοσίγαιος. ἧος ὁ ταῦθʼ ὥρμαινε κατὰ φρένα καὶ κατὰ θυμόν,
 “Ah, woe is me! what is to befall me? What will happen to me at the last? If here in the river bed I keep watch throughout the weary night, I fear that together the bitter frost and the fresh dew may overcome me, when from feebleness I have breathed forth my spirit; and the breeze from the river blows cold in the early morning.	τόφρα δέ μιν μέγα κῦμα φέρε τρηχεῖαν ἐπʼ ἀκτήν. ἔνθα κʼ ἀπὸ ῥινοὺς δρύφθη, σὺν δʼ ὀστέʼ ἀράχθη, εἰ μὴ ἐπὶ φρεσὶ θῆκε θεά, γλαυκῶπις Ἀθήνη· ἀμφοτέρῃσι δὲ χερσὶν ἐπεσσύμενος λάβε πέτρης, τῆς ἔχετο στενάχων, ἧος μέγα κῦμα παρῆλθε.
But if I climb up the slope to the shady wood and lie down to rest in the thick brushwood, in the hope that the cold and weariness might leave me, and if sweet sleep comes over me, I fear me lest I become a prey and spoil to wild beasts.” Then, as he pondered, this thing seemed to him the better:	καὶ τὸ μὲν ὣς ὑπάλυξε, παλιρρόθιον δέ μιν αὖτις πλῆξεν ἐπεσσύμενον, τηλοῦ δέ μιν ἔμβαλε πόντῳ. ὡς δʼ ὅτε πουλύποδος θαλάμης ἐξελκομένοιο πρὸς κοτυληδονόφιν πυκιναὶ λάιγγες ἔχονται, ὣς τοῦ πρὸς πέτρῃσι θρασειάων ἀπὸ χειρῶν
 he went his way to the wood and found it near the water in a clear space; and he crept beneath two bushes that grew from the same spot, one of thorn and one of olive. Through these the strength of the wet winds could never blow, nor the rays of the bright sun beat,	ῥινοὶ ἀπέδρυφθεν· τὸν δὲ μέγα κῦμα κάλυψεν. ἔνθα κε δὴ δύστηνος ὑπὲρ μόρον ὤλετʼ Ὀδυσσεύς, εἰ μὴ ἐπιφροσύνην δῶκε γλαυκῶπις Ἀθήνη. κύματος ἐξαναδύς, τά τʼ ἐρεύγεται ἤπειρόνδε, νῆχε παρέξ, ἐς γαῖαν ὁρώμενος, εἴ που ἐφεύροι
 nor could the rain pierce through them, so closely did they grow, intertwining one with the other. Beneath these Odysseus crept and straightway gathered with his hands a broad bed, for fallen leaves were there in plenty, enough to shelter two men or three	ἠιόνας τε παραπλῆγας λιμένας τε θαλάσσης. ἀλλʼ ὅτε δὴ ποταμοῖο κατὰ στόμα καλλιρόοιο ἷξε νέων, τῇ δή οἱ ἐείσατο χῶρος ἄριστος, λεῖος πετράων, καὶ ἐπὶ σκέπας ἦν ἀνέμοιο, ἔγνω δὲ προρέοντα καὶ εὔξατο ὃν κατὰ θυμόν·
 in winter-time, however bitter the weather. And the much-enduring goodly Odysseus saw it, and was glad, and he lay down in the midst, and heaped over him the fallen leaves. And as a man hides a brand beneath the dark embers in an outlying farm, a man who has no neighbors,	κλῦθι, ἄναξ, ὅτις ἐσσί· πολύλλιστον δέ σʼ ἱκάνω, φεύγων ἐκ πόντοιο Ποσειδάωνος ἐνιπάς. αἰδοῖος μέν τʼ ἐστὶ καὶ ἀθανάτοισι θεοῖσιν ἀνδρῶν ὅς τις ἵκηται ἀλώμενος, ὡς καὶ ἐγὼ νῦν σόν τε ῥόον σά τε γούναθʼ ἱκάνω πολλὰ μογήσας.
 and so saves a seed of fire, that he may not have to kindle it from some other source, so Odysseus covered himself with leaves. And Athena shed sleep upon his eyes, that it might enfold his lids and speedily free him from toilsome weariness.	ἀλλʼ ἐλέαιρε, ἄναξ· ἱκέτης δέ τοι εὔχομαι εἶναι. ὣς φάθʼ, ὁ δʼ αὐτίκα παῦσεν ἑὸν ῥόον, ἔσχε δὲ κῦμα, πρόσθε δέ οἱ ποίησε γαλήνην, τὸν δʼ ἐσάωσεν ἐς ποταμοῦ προχοάς. ὁ δʼ ἄρʼ ἄμφω γούνατʼ ἔκαμψε χεῖράς τε στιβαράς. ἁλὶ γὰρ δέδμητο φίλον κῆρ.
 So he lay there asleep, the much-enduring goodly Odysseus, overcome with sleep and weariness; but Athena went to the land and city of the Phaeacians. These dwelt of old in spacious Hypereia	καὶ τὸ μὲν ἐς ποταμὸν ἁλιμυρήεντα μεθῆκεν, ἂψ δʼ ἔφερεν μέγα κῦμα κατὰ ῥόον, αἶψα δʼ ἄρʼ Ἰνὼ δέξατο χερσὶ φίλῃσιν· ὁ δʼ ἐκ ποταμοῖο λιασθεὶς σχοίνῳ ὑπεκλίνθη, κύσε δὲ ζείδωρον ἄρουραν. ὀχθήσας δʼ ἄρα εἶπε πρὸς ὃν μεγαλήτορα θυμόν·
hard by the Cyclopes, men overweening in pride who plundered them continually and were mightier than they. From thence Nausithous, the godlike, had removed them, and led and settled them in Scheria far from men that live by toil. About the city he had drawn a wall, he had built houses	ὤ μοι ἐγώ, τί πάθω; τί νύ μοι μήκιστα γένηται; εἰ μέν κʼ ἐν ποταμῷ δυσκηδέα νύκτα φυλάσσω, μή μʼ ἄμυδις στίβη τε κακὴ καὶ θῆλυς ἐέρση ἐξ ὀλιγηπελίης δαμάσῃ κεκαφηότα θυμόν· αὔρη δʼ ἐκ ποταμοῦ ψυχρὴ πνέει ἠῶθι πρό.
 and made temples for the gods, and divided the ploughlands; but he, ere now, had been stricken by fate and had gone to the house of Hades, and Alcinous was now king, made wise in counsel by the gods. To his house went the goddess, flashing-eyed Athena, to contrive the return of great-hearted Odysseus.	εἰ δέ κεν ἐς κλιτὺν ἀναβὰς καὶ δάσκιον ὕλην θάμνοις ἐν πυκινοῖσι καταδράθω, εἴ με μεθείη ῥῖγος καὶ κάματος, γλυκερὸς δέ μοι ὕπνος ἐπέλθῃ, δείδω, μὴ θήρεσσιν ἕλωρ καὶ κύρμα γένωμαι. ὣς ἄρα οἱ φρονέοντι δοάσσατο κέρδιον εἶναι·
She went to a chamber, richly wrought, wherein slept a maiden like the immortal goddesses in form and comeliness, Nausicaa, the daughter of great-hearted Alcinous; hard by slept two hand-maidens, gifted with beauty by the Graces, one on either side of the door-posts, and the bright doors were shut.	βῆ ῥʼ ἴμεν εἰς ὕλην· τὴν δὲ σχεδὸν ὕδατος εὗρεν ἐν περιφαινομένῳ· δοιοὺς δʼ ἄρʼ ὑπήλυθε θάμνους, ἐξ ὁμόθεν πεφυῶτας· ὁ μὲν φυλίης, ὁ δʼ ἐλαίης. τοὺς μὲν ἄρʼ οὔτʼ ἀνέμων διάη μένος ὑγρὸν ἀέντων, οὔτε ποτʼ ἠέλιος φαέθων ἀκτῖσιν ἔβαλλεν,
But like a breath of air the goddess sped to the couch of the maiden, and stood above her head, and spoke to her, taking the form of the daughter of Dymas, famed for his ships, a girl who was of like age with Nausicaa, and was dear to her heart. Likening herself to her, the flashing-eyed Athena spoke and said:	οὔτʼ ὄμβρος περάασκε διαμπερές· ὣς ἄρα πυκνοὶ ἀλλήλοισιν ἔφυν ἐπαμοιβαδίς· οὓς ὑπʼ Ὀδυσσεὺς δύσετʼ. ἄφαρ δʼ εὐνὴν ἐπαμήσατο χερσὶ φίλῃσιν εὐρεῖαν· φύλλων γὰρ ἔην χύσις ἤλιθα πολλή, ὅσσον τʼ ἠὲ δύω ἠὲ τρεῖς ἄνδρας ἔρυσθαι
 “Nausicaa, how comes it that thy mother bore thee so heedless? Thy bright raiment is lying uncared for; yet thy marriage is near at hand, when thou must needs thyself be clad in fair garments, and give other such to those who escort thee. It is from things like these, thou knowest, that good report goeth up among men,	ὥρῃ χειμερίῃ, εἰ καὶ μάλα περ χαλεπαίνοι. τὴν μὲν ἰδὼν γήθησε πολύτλας δῖος Ὀδυσσεύς, ἐν δʼ ἄρα μέσσῃ λέκτο, χύσιν δʼ ἐπεχεύατο φύλλων. ὡς δʼ ὅτε τις δαλὸν σποδιῇ ἐνέκρυψε μελαίνῃ ἀγροῦ ἐπʼ ἐσχατιῆς, ᾧ μὴ πάρα γείτονες ἄλλοι,
 and the father and honored mother rejoice. Nay, come, let us go to wash them at break of day, for I will follow with thee to aid thee, that thou mayest with speed make thee ready; for thou shalt not long remain a maiden. Even now thou hast suitors in the land, the noblest	σπέρμα πυρὸς σώζων, ἵνα μή ποθεν ἄλλοθεν αὔοι, ὣς Ὀδυσεὺς φύλλοισι καλύψατο· τῷ δʼ ἄρʼ Ἀθήνη ὕπνον ἐπʼ ὄμμασι χεῦʼ, ἵνα μιν παύσειε τάχιστα δυσπονέος καμάτοιο φίλα βλέφαρʼ ἀμφικαλύψας.
to go thus than on foot, for the washing tanks are far from the city.” So saying, the goddess, flashing-eyed Athena, departed to Olympus , where, they say, is the abode of the gods that stands fast forever. Neither is it shaken by winds nor ever wet with rain, nor does snow fall upon it, but the air	ὣς ὁ μὲν ἔνθα καθεῦδε πολύτλας δῖος Ὀδυσσεὺς ὕπνῳ καὶ καμάτῳ ἀρημένος· αὐτὰρ Ἀθήνη βῆ ῥʼ ἐς Φαιήκων ἀνδρῶν δῆμόν τε πόλιν τε, οἳ πρὶν μέν ποτʼ ἔναιον ἐν εὐρυχόρῳ Ὑπερείῃ,
is outspread clear and cloudless, and over it hovers a radiant whiteness. Therein the blessed gods are glad all their days, and thither went the flashing-eyed one, when she had spoken all her word to the maiden. At once then came fair-throned Dawn and awakened Nausicaa of the beautiful robes, and straightway she marvelled at her dream,	ἀγχοῦ Κυκλώπων ἀνδρῶν ὑπερηνορεόντων, οἵ σφεας σινέσκοντο, βίηφι δὲ φέρτεροι ἦσαν. ἔνθεν ἀναστήσας ἄγε Ναυσίθοος θεοειδής, εἷσεν δὲ Σχερίῃ, ἑκὰς ἀνδρῶν ἀλφηστάων, ἀμφὶ δὲ τεῖχος ἔλασσε πόλει, καὶ ἐδείματο οἴκους,
 and went through the house to tell her parents, her father dear and her mother; and she found them both within. The mother sat at the hearth with her handmaidens, spinning the yarn of purple dye, and her father she met as he was going forth to join the glorious kings	καὶ νηοὺς ποίησε θεῶν, καὶ ἐδάσσατʼ ἀρούρας. ἀλλʼ ὁ μὲν ἤδη κηρὶ δαμεὶς Ἄϊδόσδε βεβήκει, Ἀλκίνοος δὲ τότʼ ἦρχε, θεῶν ἄπο μήδεα εἰδώς. τοῦ μὲν ἔβη πρὸς δῶμα θεά, γλαυκῶπις Ἀθήνη, νόστον Ὀδυσσῆι μεγαλήτορι μητιόωσα.
in the place of council, to which the lordly Phaeacians called him. But she came up close to her dear father, and said: “Papa dear, wilt thou not make ready for me a wagon, high and stout of wheel, that I may take to the river for washing the goodly raiment of mine which is lying here soiled?	βῆ δʼ ἴμεν ἐς θάλαμον πολυδαίδαλον, ᾧ ἔνι κούρη κοιμᾶτʼ ἀθανάτῃσι φυὴν καὶ εἶδος ὁμοίη, Ναυσικάα, θυγάτηρ μεγαλήτορος Ἀλκινόοιο, πὰρ δὲ δύʼ ἀμφίπολοι, Χαρίτων ἄπο κάλλος ἔχουσαι, σταθμοῖιν ἑκάτερθε· θύραι δʼ ἐπέκειντο φαειναί.
 Moreover for thyself it is seemly that when thou art at council with the princes thou shouldst have clean raiment upon thee; and thou hast five sons living in thy halls—two are wedded, but three are sturdy bachelors—and these ever wish to put on them freshly-washed raiment,	ἡ δʼ ἀνέμου ὡς πνοιὴ ἐπέσσυτο δέμνια κούρης, στῆ δʼ ἄρʼ ὑπὲρ κεφαλῆς, καί μιν πρὸς μῦθον ἔειπεν, εἰδομένη κούρῃ ναυσικλειτοῖο Δύμαντος, ἥ οἱ ὁμηλικίη μὲν ἔην, κεχάριστο δὲ θυμῷ. τῇ μιν ἐεισαμένη προσέφη γλαυκῶπις Ἀθήνη·
when they go to the dance. Of all this must I take thought.” So she spoke, for she was ashamed to name gladsome marriage to her father; but he understood all, and answered, saying: “Neither the mules do I begrudge thee, my child, nor aught beside. Go thy way; the slaves shall make ready for thee the wagon,	Ναυσικάα, τί νύ σʼ ὧδε μεθήμονα γείνατο μήτηρ; εἵματα μέν τοι κεῖται ἀκηδέα σιγαλόεντα, σοὶ δὲ γάμος σχεδόν ἐστιν, ἵνα χρὴ καλὰ μὲν αὐτὴν ἕννυσθαι, τὰ δὲ τοῖσι παρασχεῖν, οἵ κέ σʼ ἄγωνται. ἐκ γάρ τοι τούτων φάτις ἀνθρώπους ἀναβαίνει
high and stout of wheel and fitted with a box above.” With this he called to the slaves, and they hearkened. Outside the palace they made ready the light-running mule wagon, and led up the mules and yoked them to it; and the maiden brought from her chamber the bright raiment,	ἐσθλή, χαίρουσιν δὲ πατὴρ καὶ πότνια μήτηρ. ἀλλʼ ἴομεν πλυνέουσαι ἅμʼ ἠοῖ φαινομένηφι· καί τοι ἐγὼ συνέριθος ἅμʼ ἕψομαι, ὄφρα τάχιστα ἐντύνεαι, ἐπεὶ οὔ τοι ἔτι δὴν παρθένος ἔσσεαι· ἤδη γάρ σε μνῶνται ἀριστῆες κατὰ δῆμον
 and placed it upon the polished car, while her mother put in a chest food of all sorts to satisfy the heart. Therein she put dainties, and poured wine in a goat-skin flask; and the maiden mounted upon the wagon. Her mother gave her also soft olive oil in a flask of gold,	πάντων Φαιήκων, ὅθι τοι γένος ἐστὶ καὶ αὐτῇ. ἀλλʼ ἄγʼ ἐπότρυνον πατέρα κλυτὸν ἠῶθι πρὸ ἡμιόνους καὶ ἄμαξαν ἐφοπλίσαι, ἥ κεν ἄγῃσι ζῶστρά τε καὶ πέπλους καὶ ῥήγεα σιγαλόεντα. καὶ δὲ σοὶ ὧδʼ αὐτῇ πολὺ κάλλιον ἠὲ πόδεσσιν
that she and her maidens might have it for the bath. Then Nausicaa took the whip and the bright reins, and smote the mules to start them; and there was a clatter of the mules as they sped on a main, bearing the raiment and the maiden; neither went she alone, for with her went her handmaids as well.	ἔρχεσθαι· πολλὸν γὰρ ἀπὸ πλυνοί εἰσι πόληος. ἡ μὲν ἄρʼ ὣς εἰποῦσʼ ἀπέβη γλαυκῶπις Ἀθήνη Οὔλυμπόνδʼ, ὅθι φασὶ θεῶν ἕδος ἀσφαλὲς αἰεὶ ἔμμεναι. οὔτʼ ἀνέμοισι τινάσσεται οὔτε ποτʼ ὄμβρῳ δεύεται οὔτε χιὼν ἐπιπίλναται, ἀλλὰ μάλʼ αἴθρη
 Now when they came to the beautiful streams of the river, where were the washing tanks that never failed—for abundant clear water welled up from beneath and flowed over, to cleanse garments however soiled—there they loosed the mules from under the wagon and drove them along the eddying river	πέπταται ἀνέφελος, λευκὴ δʼ ἐπιδέδρομεν αἴγλη· τῷ ἔνι τέρπονται μάκαρες θεοὶ ἤματα πάντα. ἔνθʼ ἀπέβη γλαυκῶπις, ἐπεὶ διεπέφραδε κούρῃ. αὐτίκα δʼ Ἠὼς ἦλθεν ἐύθρονος, ἥ μιν ἔγειρε Ναυσικάαν ἐύπεπλον· ἄφαρ δʼ ἀπεθαύμασʼ ὄνειρον,
 to graze on the honey-sweet water-grass, and themselves took in their arms the raiment from the wagon, and bore it into the dark water, and trampled it in the trenches, busily vying each with each. Now when they had washed the garments, and had cleansed them of all the stains, they spread them out in rows on the shore of the sea where	βῆ δʼ ἰέναι διὰ δώμαθʼ, ἵνʼ ἀγγείλειε τοκεῦσιν, πατρὶ φίλῳ καὶ μητρί· κιχήσατο δʼ ἔνδον ἐόντας· ἡ μὲν ἐπʼ ἐσχάρῃ ἧστο σὺν ἀμφιπόλοισι γυναιξὶν ἠλάκατα στρωφῶσʼ ἁλιπόρφυρα· τῷ δὲ θύραζε ἐρχομένῳ ξύμβλητο μετὰ κλειτοὺς βασιλῆας
 the waves dashing against the land washed the pebbles cleanest; and they, after they had bathed and anointed themselves richly with oil, took their meal on the river's banks, and waited for the clothing to dry in the bright sunshine. Then when they had had their joy of food, she and her handmaids,	ἐς βουλήν, ἵνα μιν κάλεον Φαίηκες ἀγαυοί. ἡ δὲ μάλʼ ἄγχι στᾶσα φίλον πατέρα προσέειπε· πάππα φίλʼ, οὐκ ἂν δή μοι ἐφοπλίσσειας ἀπήνην ὑψηλὴν ἐύκυκλον, ἵνα κλυτὰ εἵματʼ ἄγωμαι ἐς ποταμὸν πλυνέουσα, τά μοι ῥερυπωμένα κεῖται;
they threw off their head-gear and fell to playing at ball, and white-armed Nausicaa was leader in the song. And even as Artemis, the archer, roves over the mountains, along the ridges of lofty Taygetus or Erymanthus, joying in the pursuit of boars and swift deer,	καὶ δὲ σοὶ αὐτῷ ἔοικε μετὰ πρώτοισιν ἐόντα βουλὰς βουλεύειν καθαρὰ χροΐ εἵματʼ ἔχοντα. πέντε δέ τοι φίλοι υἷες ἐνὶ μεγάροις γεγάασιν, οἱ δύʼ ὀπυίοντες, τρεῖς δʼ ἠίθεοι θαλέθοντες· οἱ δʼ αἰεὶ ἐθέλουσι νεόπλυτα εἵματʼ ἔχοντες
and with her sport the wood-nymphs, the daughters of Zeus who bears the aegis, and Leto is glad at heart—high above them all Artemis holds her head and brows, and easily may she be known, though all are fair—so amid her handmaidens shone the maid unwed.	ἐς χορὸν ἔρχεσθαι· τὰ δʼ ἐμῇ φρενὶ πάντα μέμηλεν. ὣς ἔφατʼ· αἴδετο γὰρ θαλερὸν γάμον ἐξονομῆναι πατρὶ φίλῳ. ὁ δὲ πάντα νόει καὶ ἀμείβετο μύθῳ· οὔτε τοι ἡμιόνων φθονέω, τέκος, οὔτε τευ ἄλλου. ἔρχευ· ἀτάρ τοι δμῶες ἐφοπλίσσουσιν ἀπήνην
 But when she was about to yoke the mules, and fold the fair raiment, in order to return homeward, then the goddess, flashing-eyed Athena, took other counsel, that Odysseus might awake and see the fair-faced maid, who should lead him to the city of the Phaeacians.	ὑψηλὴν ἐύκυκλον, ὑπερτερίῃ ἀραρυῖαν. ὣς εἰπὼν δμώεσσιν ἐκέκλετο, τοὶ δʼ ἐπίθοντο. οἱ μὲν ἄρʼ ἐκτὸς ἄμαξαν ἐύτροχον ἡμιονείην ὥπλεον, ἡμιόνους θʼ ὕπαγον ζεῦξάν θʼ ὑπʼ ἀπήνῃ· κούρη δʼ ἐκ θαλάμοιο φέρεν ἐσθῆτα φαεινήν.
So then the princess tossed the ball to one of her maidens; the maiden indeed she missed, but cast it into a deep eddy, and thereat they cried aloud, and goodly Odysseus awoke, and sat up, and thus he pondered in mind and heart: “Woe is me! to the land of what mortals am I now come?	καὶ τὴν μὲν κατέθηκεν ἐυξέστῳ ἐπʼ ἀπήνῃ, μήτηρ δʼ ἐν κίστῃ ἐτίθει μενοεικέʼ ἐδωδὴν παντοίην, ἐν δʼ ὄψα τίθει, ἐν δʼ οἶνον ἔχευεν ἀσκῷ ἐν αἰγείῳ· κούρη δʼ ἐπεβήσετʼ ἀπήνης. δῶκεν δὲ χρυσέῃ ἐν ληκύθῳ ὑγρὸν ἔλαιον,
 Are they cruel, and wild, and unjust? or do they love strangers and fear the gods in their thoughts? There rang in my ears a cry as of maidens, of nymphs who haunt the towering peaks of the mountains, the springs that feed the rivers, and the grassy meadows!	ἧος χυτλώσαιτο σὺν ἀμφιπόλοισι γυναιξίν. ἡ δʼ ἔλαβεν μάστιγα καὶ ἡνία σιγαλόεντα, μάστιξεν δʼ ἐλάαν· καναχὴ δʼ ἦν ἡμιόνοιιν. αἱ δʼ ἄμοτον τανύοντο, φέρον δʼ ἐσθῆτα καὶ αὐτήν, οὐκ οἴην, ἅμα τῇ γε καὶ ἀμφίπολοι κίον ἄλλαι.
 Forth he came like a mountain-nurtured lion trusting in his might, who goes forth, beaten with rain and wind, but his two eyes are ablaze: into the midst of the kine he goes, or of the sheep, or on the track of the wild deer, and his belly bids him go even into the close-built fold, to make an attack upon the flocks.	αἱ δʼ ὅτε δὴ ποταμοῖο ῥόον περικαλλέʼ ἵκοντο, ἔνθʼ ἦ τοι πλυνοὶ ἦσαν ἐπηετανοί, πολὺ δʼ ὕδωρ καλὸν ὑπεκπρόρεεν μάλα περ ῥυπόωντα καθῆραι, ἔνθʼ αἵ γʼ ἡμιόνους μὲν ὑπεκπροέλυσαν ἀπήνης. καὶ τὰς μὲν σεῦαν ποταμὸν πάρα δινήεντα
 Even so Odysseus was about to enter the company of the fair-tressed maidens, naked though he was, for need had come upon him. But terrible did he seem to them, all befouled with brine, and they shrank in fear, one here, one there, along the jutting sand-spits. Alone the daughter of Alcinous kept her place, for	τρώγειν ἄγρωστιν μελιηδέα· ταὶ δʼ ἀπʼ ἀπήνης εἵματα χερσὶν ἕλοντο καὶ ἐσφόρεον μέλαν ὕδωρ, στεῖβον δʼ ἐν βόθροισι θοῶς ἔριδα προφέρουσαι. αὐτὰρ ἐπεὶ πλῦνάν τε κάθηράν τε ῥύπα πάντα, ἑξείης πέτασαν παρὰ θῖνʼ ἁλός, ἧχι μάλιστα
 in her heart Athena put courage, and took fear from her limbs. She fled not, but stood and faced him; and Odysseus pondered whether he should clasp the knees of the fair-faced maid, and make his prayer, or whether, standing apart as he was, he should beseech her with gentle words, in hope that she might show him the city and give him raiment.	λάιγγας ποτὶ χέρσον ἀποπλύνεσκε θάλασσα. αἱ δὲ λοεσσάμεναι καὶ χρισάμεναι λίπʼ ἐλαίῳ δεῖπνον ἔπειθʼ εἵλοντο παρʼ ὄχθῃσιν ποταμοῖο, εἵματα δʼ ἠελίοιο μένον τερσήμεναι αὐγῇ. αὐτὰρ ἐπεὶ σίτου τάρφθεν δμῳαί τε καὶ αὐτή,
And, as he pondered, it seemed to him better to stand apart and beseech her with gentle words, lest the maiden's heart should be wroth with him if he clasped her knees; so straightway he spoke a gentle word and crafty: “I beseech thee, O queen,—a goddess art thou, or art thou mortal?	σφαίρῃ ταὶ δʼ ἄρʼ ἔπαιζον, ἀπὸ κρήδεμνα βαλοῦσαι· τῇσι δὲ Ναυσικάα λευκώλενος ἤρχετο μολπῆς. οἵη δʼ Ἄρτεμις εἶσι κατʼ οὔρεα ἰοχέαιρα, ἢ κατὰ Τηΰγετον περιμήκετον ἢ Ἐρύμανθον, τερπομένη κάπροισι καὶ ὠκείῃς ἐλάφοισι·
 If thou art a goddess, one of those who hold broad heaven, to Artemis, the daughter of great Zeus, do I liken thee most nearly in comeliness and in stature and in form. But if thou art one of mortals who dwell upon the earth, thrice-blessed then are thy father and thy honored mother,	τῇ δέ θʼ ἅμα νύμφαι, κοῦραι Διὸς αἰγιόχοιο, ἀγρονόμοι παίζουσι, γέγηθε δέ τε φρένα Λητώ· πασάων δʼ ὑπὲρ ἥ γε κάρη ἔχει ἠδὲ μέτωπα, ῥεῖά τʼ ἀριγνώτη πέλεται, καλαὶ δέ τε πᾶσαι· ὣς ἥ γʼ ἀμφιπόλοισι μετέπρεπε παρθένος ἀδμής.
and thrice-blessed thy brethren. Full well, I ween, are their hearts ever warmed with joy because of thee, as they see thee entering the dance, a plant so fair. But he again is blessed in heart above all others, who shall prevail with his gifts of wooing and lead thee to his home.	ἀλλʼ ὅτε δὴ ἄρʼ ἔμελλε πάλιν οἶκόνδε νέεσθαι ζεύξασʼ ἡμιόνους πτύξασά τε εἵματα καλά, ἔνθʼ αὖτʼ ἄλλʼ ἐνόησε θεά, γλαυκῶπις Ἀθήνη, ὡς Ὀδυσεὺς ἔγροιτο, ἴδοι τʼ ἐυώπιδα κούρην, ἥ οἱ Φαιήκων ἀνδρῶν πόλιν ἡγήσαιτο.
For never yet have mine eyes looked upon a mortal such as thou, whether man or woman; amazement holds me as I look on thee. Of a truth in Delos once I saw such a thing, a young shoot of a palm springing up beside the altar of Apollo—for thither, too, I went, and much people followed with me,	σφαῖραν ἔπειτʼ ἔρριψε μετʼ ἀμφίπολον βασίλεια· ἀμφιπόλου μὲν ἅμαρτε, βαθείῃ δʼ ἔμβαλε δίνῃ· αἱ δʼ ἐπὶ μακρὸν ἄυσαν· ὁ δʼ ἔγρετο δῖος Ὀδυσσεύς, ἑζόμενος δʼ ὥρμαινε κατὰ φρένα καὶ κατὰ θυμόν· ὤ μοι ἐγώ, τέων αὖτε βροτῶν ἐς γαῖαν ἱκάνω;
 on that journey on which evil woes were to be my portion;—even so, when I saw that, I marvelled long at heart, for never yet did such a tree spring up from the earth. And in like manner, lady, do I marvel at thee, and am amazed, and fear greatly to touch thy knees; but sore grief has come upon me.	ἦ ῥʼ οἵ γʼ ὑβρισταί τε καὶ ἄγριοι οὐδὲ δίκαιοι, ἦε φιλόξεινοι καί σφιν νόος ἐστὶ θεουδής; ὥς τέ με κουράων ἀμφήλυθε θῆλυς ἀυτή· νυμφάων, αἳ ἔχουσʼ ὀρέων αἰπεινὰ κάρηνα καὶ πηγὰς ποταμῶν καὶ πίσεα ποιήεντα.
 Yesterday, on the twentieth day, I escaped from the wine-dark sea, but ever until then the wave and the swift winds bore me from the island of Ogygia; and now fate has cast me ashore here, that here too, haply, I may suffer some ill. For not yet, methinks, will my troubles cease, but the gods ere that will bring many to pass.	ἦ νύ που ἀνθρώπων εἰμὶ σχεδὸν αὐδηέντων; ἀλλʼ ἄγʼ ἐγὼν αὐτὸς πειρήσομαι ἠδὲ ἴδωμαι. ὣς εἰπὼν θάμνων ὑπεδύσετο δῖος Ὀδυσσεύς, ἐκ πυκινῆς δʼ ὕλης πτόρθον κλάσε χειρὶ παχείῃ φύλλων, ὡς ῥύσαιτο περὶ χροῒ μήδεα φωτός.
 Nay, O queen, have pity; for it is to thee first that I am come after many grievous toils, and of the others who possess this city and land I know not one. Shew me the city, and give me some rag to throw about me, if thou hadst any wrapping for the clothes when thou camest hither.	βῆ δʼ ἴμεν ὥς τε λέων ὀρεσίτροφος ἀλκὶ πεποιθώς, ὅς τʼ εἶσʼ ὑόμενος καὶ ἀήμενος, ἐν δέ οἱ ὄσσε δαίεται· αὐτὰρ ὁ βουσὶ μετέρχεται ἢ ὀίεσσιν ἠὲ μετʼ ἀγροτέρας ἐλάφους· κέλεται δέ ἑ γαστὴρ μήλων πειρήσοντα καὶ ἐς πυκινὸν δόμον ἐλθεῖν·
 And for thyself, may the gods grant thee all that thy heart desires; a husband and a home may they grant thee, and oneness of heart—a goodly gift. For nothing is greater or better than this, when man and wife dwell in a home in one accord, a great grief to their foes	ὣς Ὀδυσεὺς κούρῃσιν ἐυπλοκάμοισιν ἔμελλε μίξεσθαι, γυμνός περ ἐών· χρειὼ γὰρ ἵκανε. σμερδαλέος δʼ αὐτῇσι φάνη κεκακωμένος ἅλμῃ, τρέσσαν δʼ ἄλλυδις ἄλλη ἐπʼ ἠιόνας προὐχούσας· οἴη δʼ Ἀλκινόου θυγάτηρ μένε· τῇ γὰρ Ἀθήνη
and a joy to their friends; but they know it best themselves.” Then white-armed Nausicaa answered him:“Stranger, since thou seemest to be neither an evil man nor a witless, and it is Zeus himself, the Olympian, that gives happy fortune to men, both to the good and the evil, to each man as he will;	θάρσος ἐνὶ φρεσὶ θῆκε καὶ ἐκ δέος εἵλετο γυίων. στῆ δʼ ἄντα σχομένη· ὁ δὲ μερμήριξεν Ὀδυσσεύς, ἢ γούνων λίσσοιτο λαβὼν ἐυώπιδα κούρην, ἦ αὔτως ἐπέεσσιν ἀποσταδὰ μειλιχίοισι λίσσοιτʼ, εἰ δείξειε πόλιν καὶ εἵματα δοίη.
 so to thee, I ween, he has given this lot, and thou must in any case endure it. But now, since thou hast come to our city and land, thou shalt not lack clothing or aught else of those things which befit a sore-tried suppliant when he cometh in the way. The city will I shew thee, and will tell thee the name of the people.	ὣς ἄρα οἱ φρονέοντι δοάσσατο κέρδιον εἶναι, λίσσεσθαι ἐπέεσσιν ἀποσταδὰ μειλιχίοισι, μή οἱ γοῦνα λαβόντι χολώσαιτο φρένα κούρη. αὐτίκα μειλίχιον καὶ κερδαλέον φάτο μῦθον. γουνοῦμαί σε, ἄνασσα· θεός νύ τις, ἦ βροτός ἐσσι;
The Phaeacians possess this city and land, and I am the daughter of great-hearted Alcinous, upon whom depend the might and power of the Phaeacians.” She spoke, and called to her fair-tressed handmaids:“Stand, my maidens. Whither do ye flee at the sight of a man?	εἰ μέν τις θεός ἐσσι, τοὶ οὐρανὸν εὐρὺν ἔχουσιν, Ἀρτέμιδί σε ἐγώ γε, Διὸς κούρῃ μεγάλοιο, εἶδός τε μέγεθός τε φυήν τʼ ἄγχιστα ἐίσκω· εἰ δέ τίς ἐσσι βροτῶν, τοὶ ἐπὶ χθονὶ ναιετάουσιν, τρὶς μάκαρες μὲν σοί γε πατὴρ καὶ πότνια μήτηρ,
Ye do not think, surely, that he is an enemy? That mortal man lives not, or exists nor shall ever be born who shall come to the land of the Phaeacians as a foeman, for we are very dear to the immortals. Far off we dwell in the surging sea,	τρὶς μάκαρες δὲ κασίγνητοι· μάλα πού σφισι θυμὸς αἰὲν ἐυφροσύνῃσιν ἰαίνεται εἵνεκα σεῖο, λευσσόντων τοιόνδε θάλος χορὸν εἰσοιχνεῦσαν. κεῖνος δʼ αὖ περὶ κῆρι μακάρτατος ἔξοχον ἄλλων, ὅς κέ σʼ ἐέδνοισι βρίσας οἶκόνδʼ ἀγάγηται.
 the furthermost of men, and no other mortals have dealings with us. Nay, this is some hapless wanderer that has come hither. Him must we now tend; for from Zeus are all strangers and beggars, and a gift, though small, is welcome. Come, then, my maidens, give to the stranger food and drink,	οὐ γάρ πω τοιοῦτον ἴδον βροτὸν ὀφθαλμοῖσιν, οὔτʼ ἄνδρʼ οὔτε γυναῖκα· σέβας μʼ ἔχει εἰσορόωντα. Δήλῳ δή ποτε τοῖον Ἀπόλλωνος παρὰ βωμῷ φοίνικος νέον ἔρνος ἀνερχόμενον ἐνόησα· ἦλθον γὰρ καὶ κεῖσε, πολὺς δέ μοι ἕσπετο λαός,
and bathe him in the river in a spot where there is shelter from the wind.” So she spoke, and they halted and called to each other. Then they set Odysseus in a sheltered place, as Nausicaa, the daughter of great-hearted Alcinous, bade, and beside him they put a cloak and a tunic for raiment,	τὴν ὁδὸν ᾗ δὴ μέλλεν ἐμοὶ κακὰ κήδεʼ ἔσεσθαι. ὣς δʼ αὔτως καὶ κεῖνο ἰδὼν ἐτεθήπεα θυμῷ δήν, ἐπεὶ οὔ πω τοῖον ἀνήλυθεν ἐκ δόρυ γαίης, ὡς σέ, γύναι, ἄγαμαί τε τέθηπά τε, δείδια δʼ αἰνῶς γούνων ἅψασθαι· χαλεπὸν δέ με πένθος ἱκάνει.
 and gave him soft olive oil in the flask of gold, and bade him bathe in the streams of the river. Then among the maidens spoke goodly Odysseus: “Maidens, stand yonder apart, that by myself I may wash the brine from my shoulders, and	χθιζὸς ἐεικοστῷ φύγον ἤματι οἴνοπα πόντον· τόφρα δέ μʼ αἰεὶ κῦμʼ ἐφόρει κραιπναί τε θύελλαι νήσου ἀπʼ Ὠγυγίης. νῦν δʼ ἐνθάδε κάββαλε δαίμων, ὄφρʼ ἔτι που καὶ τῇδε πάθω κακόν· οὐ γὰρ ὀίω παύσεσθʼ, ἀλλʼ ἔτι πολλὰ θεοὶ τελέουσι πάροιθεν.
anoint myself with olive oil; for of a truth it is long since oil came near my skin. But in your presence will I not bathe, for I am ashamed to make me naked in the midst of fair-tressed maidens.” So he said, and they went apart and told the princess. But with water from the river goodly Odysseus washed from his skin	ἀλλά, ἄνασσʼ, ἐλέαιρε· σὲ γὰρ κακὰ πολλὰ μογήσας ἐς πρώτην ἱκόμην, τῶν δʼ ἄλλων οὔ τινα οἶδα ἀνθρώπων, οἳ τήνδε πόλιν καὶ γαῖαν ἔχουσιν. ἄστυ δέ μοι δεῖξον, δὸς δὲ ῥάκος ἀμφιβαλέσθαι, εἴ τί που εἴλυμα σπείρων ἔχες ἐνθάδʼ ἰοῦσα.
 the brine which clothed his back and broad shoulders, and from his head he wiped the scurf of the unresting sea. But when he had washed his whole body and anointed himself with oil, and had put on him the raiment which the unwedded maid had given him, then Athena, the daughter of Zeus, made him	σοὶ δὲ θεοὶ τόσα δοῖεν ὅσα φρεσὶ σῇσι μενοινᾷς, ἄνδρα τε καὶ οἶκον, καὶ ὁμοφροσύνην ὀπάσειαν ἐσθλήν· οὐ μὲν γὰρ τοῦ γε κρεῖσσον καὶ ἄρειον, ἢ ὅθʼ ὁμοφρονέοντε νοήμασιν οἶκον ἔχητον ἀνὴρ ἠδὲ γυνή· πόλλʼ ἄλγεα δυσμενέεσσι,
 taller to look upon and mightier, and from his head she made the locks to flow in curls like unto the hyacinth flower. And as when a man overlays silver with gold, a cunning workman whom Hephaestus and Pallas Athena have taught all manner of craft, and full of grace is the work he produces,	χάρματα δʼ εὐμενέτῃσι, μάλιστα δέ τʼ ἔκλυον αὐτοί. τὸν δʼ αὖ Ναυσικάα λευκώλενος ἀντίον ηὔδα· ξεῖνʼ, ἐπεὶ οὔτε κακῷ οὔτʼ ἄφρονι φωτὶ ἔοικας· Ζεὺς δʼ αὐτὸς νέμει ὄλβον Ὀλύμπιος ἀνθρώποισιν, ἐσθλοῖς ἠδὲ κακοῖσιν, ὅπως ἐθέλῃσιν, ἑκάστῳ·
even so the goddess shed grace upon his head and shoulders. Then he went apart and sat down on the shore of the sea, gleaming with beauty and grace; and the damsel marvelled at him, and spoke to her fair-tressed handmaids, saying: “Listen, white-armed maidens, that I may say somewhat.	καί που σοὶ τάδʼ ἔδωκε, σὲ δὲ χρὴ τετλάμεν ἔμπης. νῦν δʼ, ἐπεὶ ἡμετέρην τε πόλιν καὶ γαῖαν ἱκάνεις, οὔτʼ οὖν ἐσθῆτος δευήσεαι οὔτε τευ ἄλλου, ὧν ἐπέοιχʼ ἱκέτην ταλαπείριον ἀντιάσαντα. ἄστυ δέ τοι δείξω, ἐρέω δέ τοι οὔνομα λαῶν.
Not without the will of all the gods who hold Olympus does this man come among the godlike Phaeacians. Before he seemed to me uncouth, but now he is like the gods, who hold broad heaven. Would that a man such as he might be called my husband,	Φαίηκες μὲν τήνδε πόλιν καὶ γαῖαν ἔχουσιν, εἰμὶ δʼ ἐγὼ θυγάτηρ μεγαλήτορος Ἀλκινόοιο, τοῦ δʼ ἐκ Φαιήκων ἔχεται κάρτος τε βίη τε. ἦ ῥα καὶ ἀμφιπόλοισιν ἐυπλοκάμοισι κέλευσε· στῆτέ μοι, ἀμφίπολοι· πόσε φεύγετε φῶτα ἰδοῦσαι;
dwelling here, and that it might please him here to remain. But come, my maidens; give to the stranger food and drink.” So she spoke, and they readily hearkened and obeyed, and set before Odysseus food and drink. Then verily did the much-enduring goodly Odysseus drink and eat,	ἦ μή πού τινα δυσμενέων φάσθʼ ἔμμεναι ἀνδρῶν; οὐκ ἔσθʼ οὗτος ἀνὴρ διερὸς βροτὸς οὐδὲ γένηται, ὅς κεν Φαιήκων ἀνδρῶν ἐς γαῖαν ἵκηται δηιοτῆτα φέρων· μάλα γὰρ φίλοι ἀθανάτοισιν. οἰκέομεν δʼ ἀπάνευθε πολυκλύστῳ ἐνὶ πόντῳ,
ravenously; for long had he been without taste of food. But the white-armed Nausicaa took other counsel. She folded the raiment and put it in the fair wagon, and yoked the stout-hoofed mules, and mounted the car herself. Then she hailed Odysseus, and spoke and addressed him:	ἔσχατοι, οὐδέ τις ἄμμι βροτῶν ἐπιμίσγεται ἄλλος. ἀλλʼ ὅδε τις δύστηνος ἀλώμενος ἐνθάδʼ ἱκάνει, τὸν νῦν χρὴ κομέειν· πρὸς γὰρ Διός εἰσιν ἅπαντες ξεῖνοί τε πτωχοί τε, δόσις δʼ ὀλίγη τε φίλη τε. ἀλλὰ δότʼ, ἀμφίπολοι, ξείνῳ βρῶσίν τε πόσιν τε,
 “Rouse thee now, stranger, to go to the city, that I may escort thee to the house of my wise father, where, I tell thee, thou shalt come to know all the noblest of the Phaeacians. Only do thou thus, and, methinks, thou dost not lack understanding: so long as we are passing through the country and the tilled fields of men go thou quickly	λούσατέ τʼ ἐν ποταμῷ, ὅθʼ ἐπὶ σκέπας ἔστʼ ἀνέμοιο. ὣς ἔφαθʼ, αἱ δʼ ἔσταν τε καὶ ἀλλήλῃσι κέλευσαν, κὰδ δʼ ἄρʼ Ὀδυσσῆʼ εἷσαν ἐπὶ σκέπας, ὡς ἐκέλευσεν Ναυσικάα θυγάτηρ μεγαλήτορος Ἀλκινόοιο· πὰρ δʼ ἄρα οἱ φᾶρός τε χιτῶνά τε εἵματʼ ἔθηκαν,
 with the handmaids behind the mules and the wagon, and I will lead the way. But when we are about to enter the city, around which runs a lofty wall,—a fair harbor lies on either side of the city and the entrance is narrow, and curved ships	δῶκαν δὲ χρυσέῃ ἐν ληκύθῳ ὑγρὸν ἔλαιον, ἤνωγον δʼ ἄρα μιν λοῦσθαι ποταμοῖο ῥοῇσιν. δή ῥα τότʼ ἀμφιπόλοισι μετηύδα δῖος Ὀδυσσεύς· ἀμφίπολοι, στῆθʼ οὕτω ἀπόπροθεν, ὄφρʼ ἐγὼ αὐτὸς ἅλμην ὤμοιιν ἀπολούσομαι, ἀμφὶ δʼ ἐλαίῳ
are drawn up along the road, for they all have stations for their ships, each man one for himself. There, too, is their place of assembly about the fair temple of Poseidon, fitted with huge stones set deep in the earth. Here the men are busied with the tackle of their black ships, with cables and sails, and here they shape the thin oar-blades.	χρίσομαι· ἦ γὰρ δηρὸν ἀπὸ χροός ἐστιν ἀλοιφή. ἄντην δʼ οὐκ ἂν ἐγώ γε λοέσσομαι· αἰδέομαι γὰρ γυμνοῦσθαι κούρῃσιν ἐυπλοκάμοισι μετελθών. ὣς ἔφαθʼ, αἱ δʼ ἀπάνευθεν ἴσαν, εἶπον δʼ ἄρα κούρῃ. αὐτὰρ ὁ ἐκ ποταμοῦ χρόα νίζετο δῖος Ὀδυσσεὺς
For the Phaeacians care not for bow or quiver, but for masts and oars of ships, and for the shapely ships, rejoicing in which they cross over the grey sea. It is their ungentle speech that I shun, lest hereafter some man should taunt me, for indeed there are insolent folk in the land,	ἅλμην, ἥ οἱ νῶτα καὶ εὐρέας ἄμπεχεν ὤμους, ἐκ κεφαλῆς δʼ ἔσμηχεν ἁλὸς χνόον ἀτρυγέτοιο. αὐτὰρ ἐπεὶ δὴ πάντα λοέσσατο καὶ λίπʼ ἄλειψεν, ἀμφὶ δὲ εἵματα ἕσσαθʼ ἅ οἱ πόρε παρθένος ἀδμής, τὸν μὲν Ἀθηναίη θῆκεν Διὸς ἐκγεγαυῖα
 and thus might some baser fellow say, shall he meet us: ‘Who is this that follows Nausicaa, a comely man and tall, a stranger? Where did she find him? He will doubtless be a husband for her. Haply she has brought from his ship some wanderer of a folk that dwell afar—for none are near us—	μείζονά τʼ εἰσιδέειν καὶ πάσσονα, κὰδ δὲ κάρητος οὔλας ἧκε κόμας, ὑακινθίνῳ ἄνθει ὁμοίας. ὡς δʼ ὅτε τις χρυσὸν περιχεύεται ἀργύρῳ ἀνὴρ ἴδρις, ὃν Ἥφαιστος δέδαεν καὶ Παλλὰς Ἀθήνη τέχνην παντοίην, χαρίεντα δὲ ἔργα τελείει,
 or some god, long prayed-for, has come down from heaven in answer to her prayers, and she will have him as her husband all her days. Better so, even if she has herself gone forth and found a husband from another people; for of a truth she scorns the Phaeacians here in the land, where she has wooers many and noble!’	ὣς ἄρα τῷ κατέχευε χάριν κεφαλῇ τε καὶ ὤμοις. ἕζετʼ ἔπειτʼ ἀπάνευθε κιὼν ἐπὶ θῖνα θαλάσσης, κάλλεϊ καὶ χάρισι στίλβων· θηεῖτο δὲ κούρη. δή ῥα τότʼ ἀμφιπόλοισιν ἐυπλοκάμοισι μετηύδα· κλῦτέ μευ, ἀμφίπολοι λευκώλενοι, ὄφρα τι εἴπω.
So will they say, and this would become a reproach to me. Yea, I would myself blame another maiden who should do such thing, and in despite of her dear father and mother, while yet they live, should consort with men before the day of open marriage. Nay, stranger, do thou quickly hearken to my words, that with all speed	οὐ πάντων ἀέκητι θεῶν, οἳ Ὄλυμπον ἔχουσιν, Φαιήκεσσʼ ὅδʼ ἀνὴρ ἐπιμίσγεται ἀντιθέοισι· πρόσθεν μὲν γὰρ δή μοι ἀεικέλιος δέατʼ εἶναι, νῦν δὲ θεοῖσιν ἔοικε, τοὶ οὐρανὸν εὐρὺν ἔχουσιν. αἲ γὰρ ἐμοὶ τοιόσδε πόσις κεκλημένος εἴη
 thou mayest win from my father an escort and a return to thy land. Thou wilt find a goodly grove of Athena hard by the road, a grove of poplar trees. In it a spring wells up, and round about is a meadow. There is my father's park and fruitful vineyard, as far from the city as a man's voice carries when he shouts.	ἐνθάδε ναιετάων, καὶ οἱ ἅδοι αὐτόθι μίμνειν. ἀλλὰ δότʼ, ἀμφίπολοι, ξείνῳ βρῶσίν τε πόσιν τε. ὣς ἔφαθʼ, αἱ δʼ ἄρα τῆς μάλα μὲν κλύον ἠδʼ ἐπίθοντο, πὰρ δʼ ἄρʼ Ὀδυσσῆι ἔθεσαν βρῶσίν τε πόσιν τε. ἦ τοι ὁ πῖνε καὶ ἦσθε πολύτλας δῖος Ὀδυσσεὺς
 Sit thou down there, and wait for a time, until we come to the city and reach the house of my father. But when thou thinkest that we have reached the house, then do thou go to the city of the Phaeacians and ask for the house of my father, great-hearted Alcinous.	ἁρπαλέως· δηρὸν γὰρ ἐδητύος ἦεν ἄπαστος. αὐτὰρ Ναυσικάα λευκώλενος ἄλλʼ ἐνόησεν· εἵματʼ ἄρα πτύξασα τίθει καλῆς ἐπʼ ἀπήνης, ζεῦξεν δʼ ἡμιόνους κρατερώνυχας, ἂν δʼ ἔβη αὐτή, ὤτρυνεν δʼ Ὀδυσῆα, ἔπος τʼ ἔφατʼ ἔκ τʼ ὀνόμαζεν·
 Easily may it be known, and a child could guide thee, a mere babe; for the houses of the Phaeacians are no wise built of such sort as is the palace of the lord Alcinous. But when the house and the court enclose thee, pass quickly through the great hall, till thou comest	ὄρσεο δὴ νῦν, ξεῖνε, πόλινδʼ ἴμεν ὄφρα σε πέμψω πατρὸς ἐμοῦ πρὸς δῶμα δαΐφρονος, ἔνθα σέ φημι πάντων Φαιήκων εἰδησέμεν ὅσσοι ἄριστοι. ἀλλὰ μάλʼ ὧδʼ ἔρδειν, δοκέεις δέ μοι οὐκ ἀπινύσσειν· ὄφρʼ ἂν μέν κʼ ἀγροὺς ἴομεν καὶ ἔργʼ ἀνθρώπων,
 to my mother, who sits at the hearth in the light of the fire, spinning the purple yarn, a wonder to behold, leaning against a pillar, and her handmaids sit behind her. There, too, leaning against the selfsame pillar, is set the throne of my father, whereon he sits and quaffs his wine, like unto an immortal.	τόφρα σὺν ἀμφιπόλοισι μεθʼ ἡμιόνους καὶ ἄμαξαν καρπαλίμως ἔρχεσθαι· ἐγὼ δʼ ὁδὸν ἡγεμονεύσω. αὐτὰρ ἐπὴν πόλιος ἐπιβήομεν, ἣν πέρι πύργος ὑψηλός, καλὸς δὲ λιμὴν ἑκάτερθε πόληος, λεπτὴ δʼ εἰσίθμη· νῆες δʼ ὁδὸν ἀμφιέλισσαι
 Him pass thou by, and cast thy hands about my mother's knees, that thou mayest quickly see with rejoicing the day of thy return, though thou art come from never so far. If in her sight thou dost win favour, then there is hope that thou wilt see thy friends, and return	εἰρύαται· πᾶσιν γὰρ ἐπίστιόν ἐστιν ἑκάστῳ. ἔνθα δέ τέ σφʼ ἀγορὴ καλὸν Ποσιδήιον ἀμφίς, ῥυτοῖσιν λάεσσι κατωρυχέεσσʼ ἀραρυῖα. ἔνθα δὲ νηῶν ὅπλα μελαινάων ἀλέγουσι, πείσματα καὶ σπεῖρα, καὶ ἀποξύνουσιν ἐρετμά.
to thy well-built house and unto thy native land.” So saying, she smote the mules with the shining whip, and they quickly left the streams of the river. Well did they trot, well did they ply their ambling feet, and she drove with care that	οὐ γὰρ Φαιήκεσσι μέλει βιὸς οὐδὲ φαρέτρη, ἀλλʼ ἱστοὶ καὶ ἐρετμὰ νεῶν καὶ νῆες ἐῖσαι, ᾗσιν ἀγαλλόμενοι πολιὴν περόωσι θάλασσαν. τῶν ἀλεείνω φῆμιν ἀδευκέα, μή τις ὀπίσσω μωμεύῃ· μάλα δʼ εἰσὶν ὑπερφίαλοι κατὰ δῆμον·
 the maidens and Odysseus might follow on foot, and with judgment did she ply the lash. Then the sun set, and they came to the glorious grove, sacred to Athena. There Odysseus sat him down, and straightway prayed to the daughter of great Zeus: “Hear me, child of aegis-bearing Zeus, unwearied one.	καί νύ τις ὧδʼ εἴπῃσι κακώτερος ἀντιβολήσας· τίς δʼ ὅδε Ναυσικάᾳ ἕπεται καλός τε μέγας τε ξεῖνος; ποῦ δέ μιν εὗρε; πόσις νύ οἱ ἔσσεται αὐτῇ. ἦ τινά που πλαγχθέντα κομίσσατο ἧς ἀπὸ νηὸς ἀνδρῶν τηλεδαπῶν, ἐπεὶ οὔ τινες ἐγγύθεν εἰσίν·
Hearken now to my prayer, since aforetime thou didst not hearken when I was smitten, what time the glorious Earth-shaker smote me. Grant that I may come to the Phaeacians as one to be welcomed and to be pitied.” So he spoke in prayer, and Pallas Athena heard him; but she did not yet appear to him face to face, for she feared	ἤ τίς οἱ εὐξαμένῃ πολυάρητος θεὸς ἦλθεν οὐρανόθεν καταβάς, ἕξει δέ μιν ἤματα πάντα. βέλτερον, εἰ καὐτή περ ἐποιχομένη πόσιν εὗρεν ἄλλοθεν· ἦ γὰρ τούσδε γʼ ἀτιμάζει κατὰ δῆμον Φαίηκας, τοί μιν μνῶνται πολέες τε καὶ ἐσθλοί.
 her father's brother; but he furiously raged against godlike Odysseus, until at length he reached his own land.	ὣς ἐρέουσιν, ἐμοὶ δέ κʼ ὀνείδεα ταῦτα γένοιτο. καὶ δʼ ἄλλῃ νεμεσῶ, ἥ τις τοιαῦτά γε ῥέζοι, ἥ τʼ ἀέκητι φίλων πατρὸς καὶ μητρὸς ἐόντων, ἀνδράσι μίσγηται, πρίν γʼ ἀμφάδιον γάμον ἐλθεῖν. ξεῖνε, σὺ δʼ ὦκʼ ἐμέθεν ξυνίει ἔπος, ὄφρα τάχιστα
 So he prayed there, the much-enduring goodly Odysseus, while the two strong mules bore the maiden to the city. But when she had come to the glorious palace of her father, she halted the mules at the outer gate, and her brothers	ἔνθα καθεζόμενος μεῖναι χρόνον, εἰς ὅ κεν ἡμεῖς ἄστυδε ἔλθωμεν καὶ ἱκώμεθα δώματα πατρός. αὐτὰρ ἐπὴν ἡμέας ἔλπῃ ποτὶ δώματʼ ἀφῖχθαι, καὶ τότε Φαιήκων ἴμεν ἐς πόλιν ἠδʼ ἐρέεσθαι δώματα πατρὸς ἐμοῦ μεγαλήτορος Ἀλκινόοιο.
 thronged about her, men like the immortals, and loosed the mules from the wagon, and bore the raiment within; and she herself went to her chamber. There a fire was kindled for her by her waiting-woman, Eurymedusa, an aged dame from Apeire. Long ago the curved ships had brought her from Apeire,	ῥεῖα δʼ ἀρίγνωτʼ ἐστί, καὶ ἂν πάϊς ἡγήσαιτο νήπιος· οὐ μὲν γάρ τι ἐοικότα τοῖσι τέτυκται δώματα Φαιήκων, οἷος δόμος Ἀλκινόοιο ἥρωος. ἀλλʼ ὁπότʼ ἄν σε δόμοι κεκύθωσι καὶ αὐλή, ὦκα μάλα μεγάροιο διελθέμεν, ὄφρʼ ἂν ἵκηαι
and men had chosen her from the spoil as a gift of honor for Alcinous, for that he was king over all the Phaeacians, and the people hearkened to him as to a god. She it was who had reared the white-armed Nausicaa in the palace, and she it was who kindled the fire for her, and made ready her supper in the chamber. Then Odysseus roused himself to go to the city, and Athena,	μητέρʼ ἐμήν· ἡ δʼ ἧσται ἐπʼ ἐσχάρῃ ἐν πυρὸς αὐγῇ, ἠλάκατα στρωφῶσʼ ἁλιπόρφυρα, θαῦμα ἰδέσθαι, κίονι κεκλιμένη· δμωαὶ δέ οἱ εἵατʼ ὄπισθεν. ἔνθα δὲ πατρὸς ἐμοῖο θρόνος ποτικέκλιται αὐτῇ, τῷ ὅ γε οἰνοποτάζει ἐφήμενος ἀθάνατος ὥς.
 with kindly purpose, cast about him a thick mist, that no one of the great-hearted Phaeacians, meeting him, should speak mockingly to him, and ask him who he was. But when he was about to enter the lovely city, then the goddess, flashing-eyed Athena, met him	τὸν παραμειψάμενος μητρὸς περὶ γούνασι χεῖρας βάλλειν ἡμετέρης, ἵνα νόστιμον ἦμαρ ἴδηαι χαίρων καρπαλίμως, εἰ καὶ μάλα τηλόθεν ἐσσί. εἴ κέν τοι κείνη γε φίλα φρονέῃσʼ ἐνὶ θυμῷ, ἐλπωρή τοι ἔπειτα φίλους τʼ ἰδέειν καὶ ἱκέσθαι
in the guise of a young maiden carrying a pitcher, and she stood before him; and goodly Odysseus questioned her, saying: “My child, couldst thou not guide me to the house of him they call Alcinous, who is lord among the people here? For I am come hither a stranger sore-tried	οἶκον ἐυκτίμενον καὶ σὴν ἐς πατρίδα γαῖαν. ὣς ἄρα φωνήσασʼ ἵμασεν μάστιγι φαεινῇ ἡμιόνους· αἱ δʼ ὦκα λίπον ποταμοῖο ῥέεθρα. αἱ δʼ ἐὺ μὲν τρώχων, ἐὺ δὲ πλίσσοντο πόδεσσιν· ἡ δὲ μάλʼ ἡνιόχευεν, ὅπως ἅμʼ ἑποίατο πεζοὶ
from afar, from a distant country; wherefore I know no one of the people who possess this city and land.” Then the goddess, flashing-eyed Athena, answered him: “Then verily, Sir stranger, I will shew thee the palace as thou dost bid me, for it lies hard by the house of my own noble father.	ἀμφίπολοί τʼ Ὀδυσεύς τε, νόῳ δʼ ἐπέβαλλεν ἱμάσθλην. δύσετό τʼ ἠέλιος καὶ τοὶ κλυτὸν ἄλσος ἵκοντο ἱρὸν Ἀθηναίης, ἵνʼ ἄρʼ ἕζετο δῖος Ὀδυσσεύς. αὐτίκʼ ἔπειτʼ ἠρᾶτο Διὸς κούρῃ μεγάλοιο· κλῦθί μευ, αἰγιόχοιο Διὸς τέκος, Ἀτρυτώνη·
 Only go thou quietly, and I will lead the way. But turn not thine eyes upon any man nor question any, for the men here endure not stranger-folk, nor do they give kindly welcome to him who comes from another land. They, indeed, trusting in the speed of their swift ships,	νῦν δή πέρ μευ ἄκουσον, ἐπεὶ πάρος οὔ ποτʼ ἄκουσας ῥαιομένου, ὅτε μʼ ἔρραιε κλυτὸς ἐννοσίγαιος. δός μʼ ἐς Φαίηκας φίλον ἐλθεῖν ἠδʼ ἐλεεινόν. ὣς ἔφατʼ εὐχόμενος, τοῦ δʼ ἔκλυε Παλλὰς Ἀθήνη. αὐτῷ δʼ οὔ πω φαίνετʼ ἐναντίη· αἴδετο γάρ ῥα

 And as he went through the city in the midst of them, the Phaeacians, famed for their ships, took no heed of him, for fair-tressed Athena, the dread goddess, would not suffer it, but shed about him a wondrous mist, for her heart was kind toward him.

But when they had come to the glorious palace of the king, the goddess, flashing-eyed Athena, was the first to speak, saying: “Here, Sir stranger, is the house which thou didst bid me shew to thee, and thou wilt find the kings, fostered of Zeus,	πατρίδα σὴν καὶ δῶμα, καὶ εἴ πού τοι φίλον ἐστίν, εἴ περ καὶ μάλα πολλὸν ἑκαστέρω ἔστʼ Εὐβοίης, τήν περ τηλοτάτω φάσʼ ἔμμεναι, οἵ μιν ἴδοντο λαῶν ἡμετέρων, ὅτε τε ξανθὸν Ῥαδάμανθυν ἦγον ἐποψόμενον Τιτυὸν Γαιήιον υἱόν. καὶ μὲν οἱ ἔνθʼ ἦλθον καὶ ἄτερ καμάτοιο τέλεσσαν ἤματι τῷ αὐτῷ καὶ ἀπήνυσαν οἴκαδʼ ὀπίσσω. εἰδήσεις δὲ καὶ αὐτὸς ἐνὶ φρεσὶν ὅσσον ἄρισται νῆες ἐμαὶ καὶ κοῦροι ἀναρρίπτειν ἅλα πηδῷ. ὣς φάτο, γήθησεν δὲ πολύτλας δῖος Ὀδυσσεύς,
 feasting at the banquet. Go thou within, and let thy heart fear nothing; for a bold man is better in all things, though he be a stranger from another land. The queen shalt thou approach first in the palace; Arete is the name by which she is called,	εὐχόμενος δʼ ἄρα εἶπεν, ἔπος τʼ ἔφατʼ ἔκ τʼ ὀνόμαζεν· Ζεῦ πάτερ, αἴθʼ ὅσα εἶπε τελευτήσειεν ἅπαντα Ἀλκίνοος· τοῦ μέν κεν ἐπὶ ζείδωρον ἄρουραν ἄσβεστον κλέος εἴη, ἐγὼ δέ κε πατρίδʼ ἱκοίμην. ὣς οἱ μὲν τοιαῦτα πρὸς ἀλλήλους ἀγόρευον·
 and she is sprung from the same line as is the king Alcinous. Nausithous at the first was born from the earth-shaker Poseidon and Periboea, the comeliest of women, youngest daughter of great-hearted Eurymedon, who once was king over the insolent Giants.	κέκλετο δʼ Ἀρήτη λευκώλενος ἀμφιπόλοισιν δέμνιʼ ὑπʼ αἰθούσῃ θέμεναι καὶ ῥήγεα καλὰ πορφύρεʼ ἐμβαλέειν, στορέσαι τʼ ἐφύπερθε τάπητας χλαίνας τʼ ἐνθέμεναι οὔλας καθύπερθεν ἕσασθαι. αἱ δʼ ἴσαν ἐκ μεγάροιο δάος μετὰ χερσὶν ἔχουσαι·
 But he brought destruction on his froward people, and was himself destroyed. But with Periboea lay Poseidon and begat a son, great-hearted Nausithous, who ruled over the Phaeacians; and Nausithous begat Rhexenor and Alcinous. Rhexenor, when as yet he had no son, Apollo of the silver bow smote	αὐτὰρ ἐπεὶ στόρεσαν πυκινὸν λέχος ἐγκονέουσαι, ὤτρυνον δʼ Ὀδυσῆα παριστάμεναι ἐπέεσσιν· ὄρσο κέων, ὦ ξεῖνε· πεποίηται δέ τοι εὐνή. ὣς φάν, τῷ δʼ ἀσπαστὸν ἐείσατο κοιμηθῆναι. ὣς ὁ μὲν ἔνθα καθεῦδε πολύτλας δῖος Ὀδυσσεὺς
 in his hall, a bridegroom though he was, and he left only one daughter, Arete. Her Alcinous made his wife, and honored her as no other woman on earth is honored, of all those who in these days direct their households in subjection to their husbands; so heartily is she honored,	τρητοῖς ἐν λεχέεσσιν ὑπʼ αἰθούσῃ ἐριδούπῳ· Ἀλκίνοος δʼ ἄρα λέκτο μυχῷ δόμου ὑψηλοῖο, πὰρ δὲ γυνὴ δέσποινα λέχος πόρσυνε καὶ εὐνήν.
If in her sight thou dost win favour, then there is hope that thou wilt see thy friends, and return to thy high-roofed house and unto thy native land.” So saying, flashing-eyed Athena departed over the unresting sea, and left lovely Scheria .	ἦμος δʼ ἠριγένεια φάνη ῥοδοδάκτυλος Ἠώς, ὤρνυτʼ ἄρʼ ἐξ εὐνῆς ἱερὸν μένος Ἀλκινόοιο, ἂν δʼ ἄρα διογενὴς ὦρτο πτολίπορθος Ὀδυσσεύς. τοῖσιν δʼ ἡγεμόνευʼ ἱερὸν μένος Ἀλκινόοιο
She came to Marathon and broad-wayed Athens , and entered the well-built house of Erectheus; but Odysseus went to the glorious palace of Alcinous. There he stood, and his heart pondered much before he reached the threshold of bronze; for there was a gleam as of sun or moon	Φαιήκων ἀγορήνδʼ, ἥ σφιν παρὰ νηυσὶ τέτυκτο. ἐλθόντες δὲ καθῖζον ἐπὶ ξεστοῖσι λίθοισι πλησίον. ἡ δʼ ἀνὰ ἄστυ μετῴχετο Παλλὰς Ἀθήνη εἰδομένη κήρυκι δαΐφρονος Ἀλκινόοιο, νόστον Ὀδυσσῆι μεγαλήτορι μητιόωσα,
over the high-roofed house of great-hearted Alcinous. Of bronze were the walls that stretched this way and that from the threshold to the innermost chamber, and around was a cornice of cyanus. Golden were the doors that shut in the well-built house, and doorposts of silver were set in a threshold of bronze.	καί ῥα ἑκάστῳ φωτὶ παρισταμένη φάτο μῦθον· δεῦτʼ ἄγε, Φαιήκων ἡγήτορες ἠδὲ μέδοντες, εἰς ἀγορὴν ἰέναι, ὄφρα ξείνοιο πύθησθε, ὃς νέον Ἀλκινόοιο δαΐφρονος ἵκετο δῶμα πόντον ἐπιπλαγχθείς, δέμας ἀθανάτοισιν ὁμοῖος.
Of silver was the lintel above, and of gold the handle. On either side of the door there stood gold and silver dogs, which Hephaestus had fashioned with cunning skill to guard the palace of great-hearted Alcinous; immortal were they and ageless all their days.	ὣς εἰποῦσʼ ὤτρυνε μένος καὶ θυμὸν ἑκάστου. καρπαλίμως δʼ ἔμπληντο βροτῶν ἀγοραί τε καὶ ἕδραι ἀγρομένων· πολλοὶ δʼ ἄρʼ ἐθηήσαντο ἰδόντες υἱὸν Λαέρταο δαΐφρονα· τῷ δʼ ἄρʼ Ἀθήνη θεσπεσίην κατέχευε χάριν κεφαλῇ τε καὶ ὤμοις
 Within, seats were fixed along the wall on either hand, from the threshold to the innermost chamber, and on them were thrown robes of soft fabric, cunningly woven, the handiwork of women. On these the leaders of the Phaeacians were wont to sit drinking and eating, for they had unfailing store.	καί μιν μακρότερον καὶ πάσσονα θῆκεν ἰδέσθαι, ὥς κεν Φαιήκεσσι φίλος πάντεσσι γένοιτο δεινός τʼ αἰδοῖός τε καὶ ἐκτελέσειεν ἀέθλους πολλούς, τοὺς Φαίηκες ἐπειρήσαντʼ Ὀδυσῆος. αὐτὰρ ἐπεί ῥʼ ἤγερθεν ὁμηγερέες τʼ ἐγένοντο,
 And golden youths stood on well-built pedestals, holding lighted torches in their hands to give light by night to the banqueters in the hall. And fifty slave-women he had in the house, of whom some grind the yellow grain on the millstone,	τοῖσιν δʼ Ἀλκίνοος ἀγορήσατο καὶ μετέειπε· κέκλυτε, Φαιήκων ἡγήτορες ἠδὲ μέδοντες, ὄφρʼ εἴπω τά με θυμὸς ἐνὶ στήθεσσι κελεύει. ξεῖνος ὅδʼ, οὐκ οἶδʼ ὅς τις, ἀλώμενος ἵκετʼ ἐμὸν δῶ, ἠὲ πρὸς ἠοίων ἦ ἑσπερίων ἀνθρώπων·
and others weave webs, or, as they sit, twirl the yarn, like unto the leaves of a tall poplar tree; and from the closely-woven linen the soft olive oil drips down. For as the Phaeacian men are skilled above all others in speeding a swift ship upon the sea, so are the women	πομπὴν δʼ ὀτρύνει, καὶ λίσσεται ἔμπεδον εἶναι. ἡμεῖς δʼ, ὡς τὸ πάρος περ, ἐποτρυνώμεθα πομπήν. οὐδὲ γὰρ οὐδέ τις ἄλλος, ὅτις κʼ ἐμὰ δώμαθʼ ἵκηται, ἐνθάδʼ ὀδυρόμενος δηρὸν μένει εἵνεκα πομπῆς. ἀλλʼ ἄγε νῆα μέλαιναν ἐρύσσομεν εἰς ἅλα δῖαν
cunning workers at the loom, for Athena has given to them above all others skill in fair handiwork, and an understanding heart. But without the courtyard, hard by the door, is a great orchard of four acres, and a hedge runs about it on either side. Therein grow trees, tall and luxuriant,	πρωτόπλοον, κούρω δὲ δύω καὶ πεντήκοντα κρινάσθων κατὰ δῆμον, ὅσοι πάρος εἰσὶν ἄριστοι. δησάμενοι δʼ ἐὺ πάντες ἐπὶ κληῖσιν ἐρετμὰ ἔκβητʼ· αὐτὰρ ἔπειτα θοὴν ἀλεγύνετε δαῖτα ἡμέτερόνδʼ ἐλθόντες· ἐγὼ δʼ ἐὺ πᾶσι παρέξω.
 pears and pomegranates and apple-trees with their bright fruit, and sweet figs, and luxuriant olives. Of these the fruit perishes not nor fails in winter or in summer, but lasts throughout the year; and ever does the west wind, as it blows, quicken to life some fruits, and ripen others;	κούροισιν μὲν ταῦτʼ ἐπιτέλλομαι· αὐτὰρ οἱ ἄλλοι σκηπτοῦχοι βασιλῆες ἐμὰ πρὸς δώματα καλὰ ἔρχεσθʼ, ὄφρα ξεῖνον ἐνὶ μεγάροισι φιλέωμεν, μηδέ τις ἀρνείσθω. καλέσασθε δὲ θεῖον ἀοιδὸν Δημόδοκον· τῷ γάρ ῥα θεὸς πέρι δῶκεν ἀοιδὴν
 pear upon pear waxes ripe, apple upon apple, cluster upon cluster, and fig upon fig. There, too, is his fruitful vineyard planted, one part of which, a warm spot on level ground, is being dried in the sun, while other grapes men are gathering,	τέρπειν, ὅππῃ θυμὸς ἐποτρύνῃσιν ἀείδειν. ὣς ἄρα φωνήσας ἡγήσατο, τοὶ δʼ ἅμʼ ἕποντο σκηπτοῦχοι· κῆρυξ δὲ μετῴχετο θεῖον ἀοιδόν. κούρω δὲ κρινθέντε δύω καὶ πεντήκοντα βήτην, ὡς ἐκέλευσʼ, ἐπὶ θῖνʼ ἁλὸς ἀτρυγέτοιο.
 and others, too, they are treading; but in front are unripe grapes that are shedding the blossom, and others that are turning purple. There again, by the last row of the vines, grow trim garden beds of every sort, blooming the year through, and therein are two springs, one of which sends its water throughout all the garden,	αὐτὰρ ἐπεί ῥʼ ἐπὶ νῆα κατήλυθον ἠδὲ θάλασσαν, νῆα μὲν οἵ γε μέλαιναν ἁλὸς βένθοσδε ἔρυσσαν, ἐν δʼ ἱστόν τʼ ἐτίθεντο καὶ ἱστία νηὶ μελαίνῃ, ἠρτύναντο δʼ ἐρετμὰ τροποῖς ἐν δερματίνοισι, πάντα κατὰ μοῖραν, ἀνά θʼ ἱστία λευκὰ πέτασσαν.
while the other, over against it, flows beneath the threshold of the court toward the high house; from this the townsfolk drew their water. Such were the glorious gifts of the gods in the palace of Alcinous. There the much-enduring goodly Odysseus stood and gazed. But when he had marvelled in his heart at all things,	ὑψοῦ δʼ ἐν νοτίῳ τήν γʼ ὥρμισαν· αὐτὰρ ἔπειτα βάν ῥʼ ἴμεν Ἀλκινόοιο δαΐφρονος ἐς μέγα δῶμα. πλῆντο δʼ ἄρʼ αἴθουσαί τε καὶ ἕρκεα καὶ δόμοι ἀνδρῶν ἀγρομένων· πολλοὶ δʼ ἄρʼ ἔσαν, νέοι ἠδὲ παλαιοί. τοῖσιν δʼ Ἀλκίνοος δυοκαίδεκα μῆλʼ ἱέρευσεν,
 he passed quickly over the threshold into the house. There he found the leaders and counsellors of the Phaeacians pouring libations from their cups to the keen-sighted Argeiphontes, to whom they were wont to pour the wine last of all, when they were minded to go to their rest. But the much-enduring goodly Odysseus went through the hall,	ὀκτὼ δʼ ἀργιόδοντας ὕας, δύο δʼ εἰλίποδας βοῦς· τοὺς δέρον ἀμφί θʼ ἕπον, τετύκοντό τε δαῖτʼ ἐρατεινήν. κῆρυξ δʼ ἐγγύθεν ἦλθεν ἄγων ἐρίηρον ἀοιδόν, τὸν πέρι μοῦσʼ ἐφίλησε, δίδου δʼ ἀγαθόν τε κακόν τε· ὀφθαλμῶν μὲν ἄμερσε, δίδου δʼ ἡδεῖαν ἀοιδήν.
 wrapped in the thick mist which Athena had shed about him, till he came to Arete and to Alcinous the king. About the knees of Arete Odysseus cast his hands, and straightway the wondrous mist melted from him, and a hush fell upon all that were in the room at sight of the man,	τῷ δʼ ἄρα Ποντόνοος θῆκε θρόνον ἀργυρόηλον μέσσῳ δαιτυμόνων, πρὸς κίονα μακρὸν ἐρείσας· κὰδ δʼ ἐκ πασσαλόφι κρέμασεν φόρμιγγα λίγειαν αὐτοῦ ὑπὲρ κεφαλῆς καὶ ἐπέφραδε χερσὶν ἑλέσθαι κῆρυξ· πὰρ δʼ ἐτίθει κάνεον καλήν τε τράπεζαν,
and they marvelled as they looked upon him. But Odysseus made his prayer: “Arete, daughter of godlike Rhexenor, to thy husband and to thy knees am I come after many toils,—aye and to these banqueters, to whom may the gods grant happiness in life, and may each of them hand down to his children	πὰρ δὲ δέπας οἴνοιο, πιεῖν ὅτε θυμὸς ἀνώγοι. οἱ δʼ ἐπʼ ὀνείαθʼ ἑτοῖμα προκείμενα χεῖρας ἴαλλον. αὐτὰρ ἐπεὶ πόσιος καὶ ἐδητύος ἐξ ἔρον ἕντο, μοῦσʼ ἄρʼ ἀοιδὸν ἀνῆκεν ἀειδέμεναι κλέα ἀνδρῶν, οἴμης τῆς τότʼ ἄρα κλέος οὐρανὸν εὐρὺν ἵκανε,
the wealth in his halls, and the dues of honor which the people have given him. But for me do ye speed my sending, that I may come to my native land, and that quickly; for long time have I been suffering woes far from my friends.” So saying he sat down on the hearth in the ashes by the fire, and they were all hushed in silence.	νεῖκος Ὀδυσσῆος καὶ Πηλεΐδεω Ἀχιλῆος, ὥς ποτε δηρίσαντο θεῶν ἐν δαιτὶ θαλείῃ ἐκπάγλοις ἐπέεσσιν, ἄναξ δʼ ἀνδρῶν Ἀγαμέμνων χαῖρε νόῳ, ὅ τʼ ἄριστοι Ἀχαιῶν δηριόωντο. ὣς γάρ οἱ χρείων μυθήσατο Φοῖβος Ἀπόλλων
 But at length there spoke among them the old lord Echeneus, who was an elder among the Phaeacians, well skilled in speech, and understanding all the wisdom of old. He with good intent addressed the assembly, and said: “Alcinous, lo, this is not the better way, nor is it seemly,	Πυθοῖ ἐν ἠγαθέῃ, ὅθʼ ὑπέρβη λάινον οὐδὸν χρησόμενος· τότε γάρ ῥα κυλίνδετο πήματος ἀρχὴ Τρωσί τε καὶ Δαναοῖσι Διὸς μεγάλου διὰ βουλάς. ταῦτʼ ἄρʼ ἀοιδὸς ἄειδε περικλυτός· αὐτὰρ Ὀδυσσεὺς πορφύρεον μέγα φᾶρος ἑλὼν χερσὶ στιβαρῇσι
 that a stranger should sit upon the ground on the hearth in the ashes; but these others hold back waiting for thy word. Come, make the stranger to arise, and set him upon a silver-studded chair, and bid the heralds mix wine,	κὰκ κεφαλῆς εἴρυσσε, κάλυψε δὲ καλὰ πρόσωπα· αἴδετο γὰρ Φαίηκας ὑπʼ ὀφρύσι δάκρυα λείβων. ἦ τοι ὅτε λήξειεν ἀείδων θεῖος ἀοιδός, δάκρυ ὀμορξάμενος κεφαλῆς ἄπο φᾶρος ἕλεσκε καὶ δέπας ἀμφικύπελλον ἑλὼν σπείσασκε θεοῖσιν·
that we may pour libations also to Zeus, who hurls the thunderbolt; for he ever attends upon reverend suppliants. And let the housewife give supper to the stranger of the store that is in the house.” When the strong and mighty Alcinous heard this, he took by the hand Odysseus, the wise and crafty-minded, and raised him from the hearth, and set him upon a bright chair	αὐτὰρ ὅτʼ ἂψ ἄρχοιτο καὶ ὀτρύνειαν ἀείδειν Φαιήκων οἱ ἄριστοι, ἐπεὶ τέρποντʼ ἐπέεσσιν, ἂψ Ὀδυσεὺς κατὰ κρᾶτα καλυψάμενος γοάασκεν. ἔνθʼ ἄλλους μὲν πάντας ἐλάνθανε δάκρυα λείβων, Ἀλκίνοος δέ μιν οἶος ἐπεφράσατʼ ἠδʼ ἐνόησεν
from which he bade his son, the kindly Laodamas, to rise; for he sat next to him, and was his best beloved. Then a handmaid brought water for the hands in a fair pitcher of gold, and poured it over a silver basin, for him to wash, and beside him drew up a polished table.	ἥμενος ἄγχʼ αὐτοῦ, βαρὺ δὲ στενάχοντος ἄκουσεν. αἶψα δὲ Φαιήκεσσι φιληρέτμοισι μετηύδα· κέκλυτε, Φαιήκων ἡγήτορες ἠδὲ μέδοντες. ἤδη μὲν δαιτὸς κεκορήμεθα θυμὸν ἐίσης φόρμιγγός θʼ, ἣ δαιτὶ συνήορός ἐστι θαλείῃ·
And the grave housewife brought and set before him bread, and therewith dainties in abundance, giving freely of her store. So the much-enduring goodly Odysseus drank and ate; and then the mighty Alcinous spoke to the herald, and said: “Pontonous, mix the bowl, and serve wine	νῦν δʼ ἐξέλθωμεν καὶ ἀέθλων πειρηθῶμεν πάντων, ὥς χʼ ὁ ξεῖνος ἐνίσπῃ οἷσι φίλοισιν οἴκαδε νοστήσας, ὅσσον περιγιγνόμεθʼ ἄλλων πύξ τε παλαιμοσύνῃ τε καὶ ἅλμασιν ἠδὲ πόδεσσιν. ὣς ἄρα φωνήσας ἡγήσατο, τοὶ δʼ ἅμʼ ἕποντο.
to all in the hall, that we may pour libations also to Zeus, who hurls the thunderbolt; for he ever attends upon reverend suppliants.” He spoke, and Pontonous mixed the honey-hearted wine, and served out to all, pouring first drops for libation into the cups. But when they had poured libations, and had drunk to their heart's content,	κὰδ δʼ ἐκ πασσαλόφι κρέμασεν φόρμιγγα λίγειαν, Δημοδόκου δʼ ἕλε χεῖρα καὶ ἔξαγεν ἐκ μεγάροιο κῆρυξ· ἦρχε δὲ τῷ αὐτὴν ὁδὸν ἥν περ οἱ ἄλλοι Φαιήκων οἱ ἄριστοι, ἀέθλια θαυμανέοντες. βὰν δʼ ἴμεν εἰς ἀγορήν, ἅμα δʼ ἕσπετο πουλὺς ὅμιλος,
Alcinous addressed the assembly, and spoke among them: “Hearken to me, leaders and counsellors of the Phaeacians, that I may say what the heart in my breast bids me. Now that ye have finished your feast, go each of you to his house to rest. But in the morning we will call more of the elders together,	μυρίοι· ἂν δʼ ἵσταντο νέοι πολλοί τε καὶ ἐσθλοί. ὦρτο μὲν Ἀκρόνεώς τε καὶ Ὠκύαλος καὶ Ἐλατρεύς, Ναυτεύς τε Πρυμνεύς τε καὶ Ἀγχίαλος καὶ Ἐρετμεύς, Ποντεύς τε Πρωρεύς τε, Θόων Ἀναβησίνεώς τε Ἀμφίαλός θʼ, υἱὸς Πολυνήου Τεκτονίδαο·
 and will entertain the stranger in our halls and offer goodly victims to the gods. After that we will take thought also of his sending, that without toil or pain yon stranger may under our sending, come to his native land speedily and with rejoicing, though he come from never so far.	ἂν δὲ καὶ Εὐρύαλος, βροτολοιγῷ ἶσος Ἄρηϊ, Ναυβολίδης, ὃς ἄριστος ἔην εἶδός τε δέμας τε πάντων Φαιήκων μετʼ ἀμύμονα Λαοδάμαντα. ἂν δʼ ἔσταν τρεῖς παῖδες ἀμύμονος Ἀλκινόοιο, Λαοδάμας θʼ Ἅλιός τε καὶ ἀντίθεος Κλυτόνηος.
Nor shall he meanwhile suffer any evil or harm, until he sets foot upon his own land; but thereafter he shall suffer whatever Fate and the dread Spinners spun with their thread for him at his birth, when his mother bore him. But if he is one of the immortals come down from heaven,	οἱ δʼ ἦ τοι πρῶτον μὲν ἐπειρήσαντο πόδεσσι. τοῖσι δʼ ἀπὸ νύσσης τέτατο δρόμος· οἱ δʼ ἅμα πάντες καρπαλίμως ἐπέτοντο κονίοντες πεδίοιο· τῶν δὲ θέειν ὄχʼ ἄριστος ἔην Κλυτόνηος ἀμύμων· ὅσσον τʼ ἐν νειῷ οὖρον πέλει ἡμιόνοιιν,
 then is this some new thing which the gods are planning; for ever heretofore have they been wont to appear to us in manifest form, when we sacrifice to them glorious hecatombs, and they feast among us, sitting even where we sit. Aye, and if one of us as a lone wayfarer meets them,	τόσσον ὑπεκπροθέων λαοὺς ἵκεθʼ, οἱ δʼ ἐλίποντο. οἱ δὲ παλαιμοσύνης ἀλεγεινῆς πειρήσαντο· τῇ δʼ αὖτʼ Εὐρύαλος ἀπεκαίνυτο πάντας ἀρίστους. ἅλματι δʼ Ἀμφίαλος πάντων προφερέστατος ἦεν· δίσκῳ δʼ αὖ πάντων πολὺ φέρτατος ἦεν Ἐλατρεύς,
they use no concealment, for we are of near kin to them, as are the Cyclopes and the wild tribes of the Giants.” Then Odysseus of many wiles answered him, and said: “Alcinous, far from thee be that thought; for I am not like the immortals, who hold broad heaven,	πὺξ δʼ αὖ Λαοδάμας, ἀγαθὸς πάϊς Ἀλκινόοιο. αὐτὰρ ἐπεὶ δὴ πάντες ἐτέρφθησαν φρένʼ ἀέθλοις, τοῖς ἄρα Λαοδάμας μετέφη πάϊς Ἀλκινόοιο· δεῦτε, φίλοι, τὸν ξεῖνον ἐρώμεθα εἴ τινʼ ἄεθλον οἶδέ τε καὶ δεδάηκε. φυήν γε μὲν οὐ κακός ἐστι,
 either in stature or in form, but like mortal men. Whomsoever ye know among men who bear greatest burden of woe, to them might I liken myself in my sorrows. Yea, and I could tell a yet longer tale of all the evils which I have endured by the will of the gods.	μηρούς τε κνήμας τε καὶ ἄμφω χεῖρας ὕπερθεν αὐχένα τε στιβαρὸν μέγα τε σθένος· οὐδέ τι ἥβης δεύεται, ἀλλὰ κακοῖσι συνέρρηκται πολέεσσιν· οὐ γὰρ ἐγώ γέ τί φημι κακώτερον ἄλλο θαλάσσης ἄνδρα γε συγχεῦαι, εἰ καὶ μάλα καρτερὸς εἴη.
 But as for me, suffer me now to eat, despite my grief; for there is nothing more shameless than a hateful belly, which bids a man perforce take thought thereof, be he never so sore distressed and laden with grief at heart, even as I, too, am laden with grief at heart, yet ever does my belly	τὸν δʼ αὖτʼ Εὐρύαλος ἀπαμείβετο φώνησέν τε· Λαοδάμα, μάλα τοῦτο ἔπος κατὰ μοῖραν ἔειπες. αὐτὸς νῦν προκάλεσσαι ἰὼν καὶ πέφραδε μῦθον. αὐτὰρ ἐπεὶ τό γʼ ἄκουσʼ ἀγαθὸς πάϊς Ἀλκινόοιο, στῆ ῥʼ ἐς μέσσον ἰὼν καὶ Ὀδυσσῆα προσέειπε·
 bid me eat and drink, and makes me forget all that I have suffered, and commands me to eat my fill. But do ye make haste at break of day, that ye may set me, hapless one, on the soil of my native land, even after my many woes. Yea, let life leave me, when I have seen once more	δεῦρʼ ἄγε καὶ σύ, ξεῖνε πάτερ, πείρησαι ἀέθλων, εἴ τινά που δεδάηκας· ἔοικε δέ σʼ ἴδμεν ἀέθλους· οὐ μὲν γὰρ μεῖζον κλέος ἀνέρος ὄφρα κʼ ἔῃσιν, ἤ ὅ τι ποσσίν τε ῥέξῃ καὶ χερσὶν ἑῇσιν. ἀλλʼ ἄγε πείρησαι, σκέδασον δʼ ἀπὸ κήδεα θυμοῦ.
my possessions, my slaves, and my great high-roofed house.” So he spoke, and they all praised his words, and bade send the stranger on his way, since he had spoken fittingly. Then when they had poured libations, and had drunk to their heart's content, they went each man to his home, to take their rest,	σοὶ δʼ ὁδὸς οὐκέτι δηρὸν ἀπέσσεται, ἀλλά τοι ἤδη νηῦς τε κατείρυσται καὶ ἐπαρτέες εἰσὶν ἑταῖροι. τὸν δʼ ἀπαμειβόμενος προσέφη πολύμητις Ὀδυσσεύς· Λαοδάμα, τί με ταῦτα κελεύετε κερτομέοντες; κήδεά μοι καὶ μᾶλλον ἐνὶ φρεσὶν ἤ περ ἄεθλοι,
 and goodly Odysseus was left behind in the hall, and beside him sat Arete and godlike Alcinous; and the handmaids cleared away the dishes of the feast. Then white-armed Arete was the first to speak; for, as she saw it, she knew his	ὃς πρὶν μὲν μάλα πολλὰ πάθον καὶ πολλὰ μόγησα, νῦν δὲ μεθʼ ὑμετέρῃ ἀγορῇ νόστοιο χατίζων ἧμαι, λισσόμενος βασιλῆά τε πάντα τε δῆμον. τὸν δʼ αὖτʼ Εὐρύαλος ἀπαμείβετο νείκεσέ τʼ ἄντην· οὐ γάρ σʼ οὐδέ, ξεῖνε, δαήμονι φωτὶ ἐίσκω
fair raiment, the mantle and tunic, which she herself had wrought with her handmaids. And she spoke, and addressed him with winged words: “Stranger, this question will I myself ask thee first. Who art thou among men, and from whence? Who gave thee this raiment? Didst thou not say that thou camest hither wandering over the sea?”	ἄθλων, οἷά τε πολλὰ μετʼ ἀνθρώποισι πέλονται, ἀλλὰ τῷ, ὅς θʼ ἅμα νηὶ πολυκλήιδι θαμίζων, ἀρχὸς ναυτάων οἵ τε πρηκτῆρες ἔασιν, φόρτου τε μνήμων καὶ ἐπίσκοπος ᾖσιν ὁδαίων κερδέων θʼ ἁρπαλέων· οὐδʼ ἀθλητῆρι ἔοικας.
 Therein dwells the fair-tressed daughter of Atlas, guileful Calypso, a dread goddess, and with her no one either of gods or mortals hath aught to do; but me in my wretchedness did fate bring to her hearth alone, for Zeus had smitten my swift ship with his bright thunderbolt,	τὸν δʼ ἄρʼ ὑπόδρα ἰδὼν προσέφη πολύμητις Ὀδυσσεύς· ξεῖνʼ, οὐ καλὸν ἔειπες· ἀτασθάλῳ ἀνδρὶ ἔοικας. οὕτως οὐ πάντεσσι θεοὶ χαρίεντα διδοῦσιν ἀνδράσιν, οὔτε φυὴν οὔτʼ ἂρ φρένας οὔτʼ ἀγορητύν. ἄλλος μὲν γάρ τʼ εἶδος ἀκιδνότερος πέλει ἀνήρ,
 and had shattered it in the midst of the wine-dark sea. There all the rest of my trusty comrades perished, but I clasped in my arms the keel of my curved ship and was borne drifting for nine days, and on the tenth black night the gods brought me to the isle, Ogygia, where	ἀλλὰ θεὸς μορφὴν ἔπεσι στέφει, οἱ δέ τʼ ἐς αὐτὸν τερπόμενοι λεύσσουσιν· ὁ δʼ ἀσφαλέως ἀγορεύει αἰδοῖ μειλιχίῃ, μετὰ δὲ πρέπει ἀγρομένοισιν, ἐρχόμενον δʼ ἀνὰ ἄστυ θεὸν ὣς εἰσορόωσιν. ἄλλος δʼ αὖ εἶδος μὲν ἀλίγκιος ἀθανάτοισιν,
 the fair-tressed Calypso dwells, a dread goddess. She took me to her home with kindly welcome, and gave me food, and said that she would make me immortal and ageless all my days; but she could never persuade the heart in my breast. There for seven years' space I remained continually, and ever	ἀλλʼ οὔ οἱ χάρις ἀμφιπεριστέφεται ἐπέεσσιν, ὡς καὶ σοὶ εἶδος μὲν ἀριπρεπές, οὐδέ κεν ἄλλως οὐδὲ θεὸς τεύξειε, νόον δʼ ἀποφώλιός ἐσσι. ὤρινάς μοι θυμὸν ἐνὶ στήθεσσι φίλοισιν εἰπὼν οὐ κατὰ κόσμον. ἐγὼ δʼ οὐ νῆις ἀέθλων,
 with my tears would I wet the immortal raiment which Calypso gave me. But when the eight year came in circling course, then she roused me and bade me go, either because of some message from Zeus, or because her own mind was turned. And she sent me on my way on a raft, stoutly bound, and gave me abundant store	ὡς σύ γε μυθεῖαι, ἀλλʼ ἐν πρώτοισιν ὀίω ἔμμεναι, ὄφρʼ ἥβῃ τε πεποίθεα χερσί τʼ ἐμῇσι. νῦν δʼ ἔχομαι κακότητι καὶ ἄλγεσι· πολλὰ γὰρ ἔτλην ἀνδρῶν τε πτολέμους ἀλεγεινά τε κύματα πείρων. ἀλλὰ καὶ ὥς, κακὰ πολλὰ παθών, πειρήσομʼ ἀέθλων·
 of bread and sweet wine, and clad me in immortal raiment, and sent forth a gentle wind and warm. So for seventeen days I sailed over the sea, and on the eighteenth appeared the shadowy mountains of your land; and my heart was glad,	θυμοδακὴς γὰρ μῦθος, ἐπώτρυνας δέ με εἰπών. ἦ ῥα καὶ αὐτῷ φάρει ἀναΐξας λάβε δίσκον μείζονα καὶ πάχετον, στιβαρώτερον οὐκ ὀλίγον περ ἢ οἵῳ Φαίηκες ἐδίσκεον ἀλλήλοισι. τόν ῥα περιστρέψας ἧκε στιβαρῆς ἀπὸ χειρός,
 ill-starred that I was; for verily I was yet to have fellowship with great woe, which Poseidon, the earth-shaker, sent upon me. For he stirred up the winds against me and stayed my course, and wondrously roused the sea, nor would the wave suffer me to be borne upon my raft, as I groaned ceaselessly.	βόμβησεν δὲ λίθος· κατὰ δʼ ἔπτηξαν ποτὶ γαίῃ Φαίηκες δολιχήρετμοι, ναυσίκλυτοι ἄνδρες, λᾶος ὑπὸ ῥιπῆς· ὁ δʼ ὑπέρπτατο σήματα πάντων ῥίμφα θέων ἀπὸ χειρός. ἔθηκε δὲ τέρματʼ Ἀθήνη ἀνδρὶ δέμας ἐικυῖα, ἔπος τʼ ἔφατʼ ἔκ τʼ ὀνόμαζεν·
 My raft indeed the storm shattered, but by swimming I clove my way through yon gulf of the sea, until the wind and the waves, as they bore me, brought me to your shores. There, had I sought to land, the waves would have hurled me upon the shore, and dashed me against the great crags and a cheerless place,	καί κʼ ἀλαός τοι, ξεῖνε, διακρίνειε τὸ σῆμα ἀμφαφόων, ἐπεὶ οὔ τι μεμιγμένον ἐστὶν ὁμίλῳ, ἀλλὰ πολὺ πρῶτον. σὺ δὲ θάρσει τόνδε γʼ ἄεθλον· οὔ τις Φαιήκων τόδε γʼ ἵξεται, οὐδʼ ὑπερήσει. ὣς φάτο, γήθησεν δὲ πολύτλας δῖος Ὀδυσσεύς,
 but I gave way, and swam back until I came to a river, where seemed to me the best place, since it was smooth of rocks, and besides there was shelter from the wind. Forth then I staggered, and sank down, gasping for breath, and immortal night came on. Then I went forth from the heaven-fed river,	χαὶρων, οὕνεχʼ ἑταῖρον ἐνηέα λεῦσσʼ ἐν ἀγῶνι. καὶ τότε κουφότερον μετεφώνεε Φαιήκεσσιν· τοῦτον νῦν ἀφίκεσθε, νέοι. τάχα δʼ ὕστερον ἄλλον ἥσειν ἢ τοσσοῦτον ὀίομαι ἢ ἔτι μᾶσσον. τῶν δʼ ἄλλων ὅτινα κραδίη θυμός τε κελεύει,
and lay down to sleep in the bushes, gathering leaves about me; and a god shed over me infinite sleep. So there among the leaves I slept, my heart sore stricken, the whole night through, until the morning and until midday; and the sun turned to his setting ere sweet sleep released me.	δεῦρʼ ἄγε πειρηθήτω, ἐπεί μʼ ἐχολώσατε λίην, ἢ πὺξ ἠὲ πάλῃ ἢ καὶ ποσίν, οὔ τι μεγαίρω, πάντων Φαιήκων, πλήν γʼ αὐτοῦ Λαοδάμαντος. ξεῖνος γάρ μοι ὅδʼ ἐστί· τίς ἂν φιλέοντι μάχοιτο; ἄφρων δὴ κεῖνός γε καὶ οὐτιδανὸς πέλει ἀνήρ,
 Then I saw the handmaids of thy daughter on the shore at play, and amid them was she, fair as the goddesses. To her I made my prayer; and she in no wise failed in good understanding, to do as thou wouldst not deem that one of younger years would do on meeting thee; for younger folk are ever thoughtless.	ὅς τις ξεινοδόκῳ ἔριδα προφέρηται ἀέθλων δήμῳ ἐν ἀλλοδαπῷ· ἕο δʼ αὐτοῦ πάντα κολούει. τῶν δʼ ἄλλων οὔ πέρ τινʼ ἀναίνομαι οὐδʼ ἀθερίζω, ἀλλʼ ἐθέλω ἴδμεν καὶ πειρηθήμεναι ἄντην. πάντα γὰρ οὐ κακός εἰμι, μετʼ ἀνδράσιν ὅσσοι ἄεθλοι·
She gave bread in plenty and sparkling wine, and bathed me in the river, and gave me this raiment. In this, for all my sorrows, have I told thee the truth.” Then in turn Alcinous answered him, and said:“Stranger, verily my daughter was not minded aright in this,	εὖ μὲν τόξον οἶδα ἐύξοον ἀμφαφάασθαι· πρῶτός κʼ ἄνδρα βάλοιμι ὀιστεύσας ἐν ὁμίλῳ ἀνδρῶν δυσμενέων, εἰ καὶ μάλα πολλοὶ ἑταῖροι ἄγχι παρασταῖεν καὶ τοξαζοίατο φωτῶν. οἶος δή με Φιλοκτήτης ἀπεκαίνυτο τόξῳ
that she did not bring thee to our house with her maidens. Yet it was to her first that thou didst make thy prayer.” Then Odysseus of many wiles answered him, and said: “Prince, rebuke not for this, I pray thee, thy blameless daughter. She did indeed bid me follow with her maidens,	δήμῳ ἔνι Τρώων, ὅτε τοξαζοίμεθʼ Ἀχαιοί. τῶν δʼ ἄλλων ἐμέ φημι πολὺ προφερέστερον εἶναι, ὅσσοι νῦν βροτοί εἰσιν ἐπὶ χθονὶ σῖτον ἔδοντες. ἀνδράσι δὲ προτέροισιν ἐριζέμεν οὐκ ἐθελήσω, οὔθʼ Ἡρακλῆι οὔτʼ Εὐρύτῳ Οιχαλιῆι,
but I would not for fear and shame, lest haply thy heart should darken with wrath as thou sawest it; for we are quick to anger, we tribes of men upon the earth.” And again Alcinous answered him, and said:“Stranger, not such is the heart in my breast,	οἵ ῥα καὶ ἀθανάτοισιν ἐρίζεσκον περὶ τόξων. τῷ ῥα καὶ αἶψʼ ἔθανεν μέγας Εὔρυτος, οὐδʼ ἐπὶ γῆρας ἵκετʼ ἐνὶ μεγάροισι· χολωσάμενος γὰρ Ἀπόλλων ἔκτανεν, οὕνεκά μιν προκαλίζετο τοξάζεσθαι. δουρὶ δʼ ἀκοντίζω ὅσον οὐκ ἄλλος τις ὀιστῷ.
 to be filled with wrath without a cause. Better is due measure in all things. I would, O father Zeus, and Athena and Apollo, that thou, so goodly a man, and like-minded with me, wouldst have my daughter to wife, and be called my son, and abide here; a house and possessions would I give thee,	οἴοισιν δείδοικα ποσὶν μή τίς με παρέλθῃ Φαιήκων· λίην γὰρ ἀεικελίως ἐδαμάσθην κύμασιν ἐν πολλοῖς, ἐπεὶ οὐ κομιδὴ κατὰ νῆα ἦεν ἐπηετανός· τῷ μοι φίλα γυῖα λέλυνται. ὣς ἔφαθʼ, οἱ δʼ ἄρα πάντες ἀκὴν ἐγένοντο σιωπῇ.
if thou shouldst choose to remain, but against thy will shall no one of the Phaeacians keep thee; let not that be the will of father Zeus. But as for thy sending, that thou mayest know it surely, I appoint a time thereto, even the morrow. Then shalt thou lie down, overcome by sleep, and they shall row thee over the calm sea until thou comest	Ἀλκίνοος δέ μιν οἶος ἀμειβόμενος προσέειπεν· ξεῖνʼ, ἐπεὶ οὐκ ἀχάριστα μεθʼ ἡμῖν ταῦτʼ ἀγορεύεις, ἀλλʼ ἐθέλεις ἀρετὴν σὴν φαινέμεν, ἥ τοι ὀπηδεῖ, χωόμενος ὅτι σʼ οὗτος ἀνὴρ ἐν ἀγῶνι παραστὰς νείκεσεν, ὡς ἂν σὴν ἀρετὴν βροτὸς οὔ τις ὄνοιτο,
to thy country and thy house, or to whatsoever place thou wilt, aye though it be even far beyond Euboea , which those of our people who saw it, when they carried fair-haired Rhadamanthus to visit Tityus, the son of Gaea, say is the furthest of lands.	ὅς τις ἐπίσταιτο ᾗσι φρεσὶν ἄρτια βάζειν· ἀλλʼ ἄγε νῦν ἐμέθεν ξυνίει ἔπος, ὄφρα καὶ ἄλλῳ εἴπῃς ἡρώων, ὅτε κεν σοῖς ἐν μεγάροισι δαινύῃ παρὰ σῇ τʼ ἀλόχῳ καὶ σοῖσι τέκεσσιν, ἡμετέρης ἀρετῆς μεμνημένος, οἷα καὶ ἡμῖν
Thither they went, and without toil accomplished their journey, and on the selfsame day came back home. So shalt thou, too, know for thyself how far my ships are the best, and my youths at tossing the brine with the oar-blade.” So said he, and the much-enduring goodly Odysseus was glad;	Ζεὺς ἐπὶ ἔργα τίθησι διαμπερὲς ἐξ ἔτι πατρῶν. οὐ γὰρ πυγμάχοι εἰμὲν ἀμύμονες οὐδὲ παλαισταί, ἀλλὰ ποσὶ κραιπνῶς θέομεν καὶ νηυσὶν ἄριστοι, αἰεὶ δʼ ἡμῖν δαίς τε φίλη κίθαρις τε χοροί τε εἵματά τʼ ἐξημοιβὰ λοετρά τε θερμὰ καὶ εὐναί.
 and white-armed Arete bade her maidens place a bedstead under cover of the portico, and to lay on it fair blankets of purple, and to spread there over coverlets, and on these to put fleecy cloaks for clothing. So they went forth from the hall with torches in their hands.	ἀλλʼ ἄγε, Φαιήκων βητάρμονες ὅσσοι ἄριστοι, παίσατε, ὥς χʼ ὁ ξεῖνος ἐνίσπῃ οἷσι φίλοισιν οἴκαδε νοστήσας, ὅσσον περιγιγνόμεθʼ ἄλλων ναυτιλίῃ καὶ ποσσὶ καὶ ὀρχηστυῖ καὶ ἀοιδῇ. Δημοδόκῳ δέ τις αἶψα κιὼν φόρμιγγα λίγειαν
But when they had busily spread the stout-built bedstead, they came to Odysseus, and called to him, and said: “Rouse thee now, stranger, to go to thy rest; thy bed is made.” Thus they spoke, and welcome did it seem to him to lay him down to sleep. So there he slept, the much-enduring goodly Odysseus,	οἰσέτω, ἥ που κεῖται ἐν ἡμετέροισι δόμοισιν. ὣς ἔφατʼ Ἀλκίνοος θεοείκελος, ὦρτο δὲ κῆρυξ οἴσων φόρμιγγα γλαφυρὴν δόμου ἐκ βασιλῆος. αἰσυμνῆται δὲ κριτοὶ ἐννέα πάντες ἀνέσταν δήμιοι, οἳ κατʼ ἀγῶνας ἐὺ πρήσσεσκον ἕκαστα,
 on the corded bedstead under the echoing portico. But Alcinous lay down in the inmost chamber of the lofty house, and beside him lay the lady his wife, who had strewn the couch.	λείηναν δὲ χορόν, καλὸν δʼ εὔρυναν ἀγῶνα. κῆρυξ δʼ ἐγγύθεν ἦλθε φέρων φόρμιγγα λίγειαν Δημοδόκῳ· ὁ δʼ ἔπειτα κίʼ ἐς μέσον· ἀμφὶ δὲ κοῦροι πρωθῆβαι ἵσταντο, δαήμονες ὀρχηθμοῖο, πέπληγον δὲ χορὸν θεῖον ποσίν. αὐτὰρ Ὀδυσσεὺς
 As soon as early Dawn appeared, the rosy-fingered, the strong and mighty Alcinous rose from his couch, and up rose also Zeus-born Odysseus, the sacker of cities. And the strong and mighty Alcinous led the way	Ἡφαίστοιο ἄνακτος. ἄφαρ δέ οἱ ἄγγελος ἦλθεν Ἥλιος, ὅ σφʼ ἐνόησε μιγαζομένους φιλότητι. Ἥφαιστος δʼ ὡς οὖν θυμαλγέα μῦθον ἄκουσε, βῆ ῥʼ ἴμεν ἐς χαλκεῶνα κακὰ φρεσὶ βυσσοδομεύων, ἐν δʼ ἔθετʼ ἀκμοθέτῳ μέγαν ἄκμονα, κόπτε δὲ δεσμοὺς
 to the place of assembly of the Phaeacians, which was builded for them hard by their ships. Thither they came and sat down on the polished stones close by one another; and Pallas Athena went throughout the city, in the likeness of the herald of wise Alcinous, devising a return for great-hearted Odysseus.	ἀρρήκτους ἀλύτους, ὄφρʼ ἔμπεδον αὖθι μένοιεν. αὐτὰρ ἐπεὶ δὴ τεῦξε δόλον κεχολωμένος Ἄρει, βῆ ῥʼ ἴμεν ἐς θάλαμον, ὅθι οἱ φίλα δέμνιʼ ἔκειτο, ἀμφὶ δʼ ἄρʼ ἑρμῖσιν χέε δέσματα κύκλῳ ἁπάντῃ· πολλὰ δὲ καὶ καθύπερθε μελαθρόφιν ἐξεκέχυντο,
To each man's side she came, and spoke and said: “Hither now, leaders and counsellors of the Phaeacians, come to the place of assembly, that you may learn of the stranger who has newly come to the palace of wise Alcinous after his wanderings over the sea, and in form is like unto the immortals.”	ἠύτʼ ἀράχνια λεπτά, τά γʼ οὔ κέ τις οὐδὲ ἴδοιτο, οὐδὲ θεῶν μακάρων· πέρι γὰρ δολόεντα τέτυκτο. αὐτὰρ ἐπεὶ δὴ πάντα δόλον περὶ δέμνια χεῦεν, εἴσατʼ ἴμεν ἐς Λῆμνον, ἐυκτίμενον πτολίεθρον, ἥ οἱ γαιάων πολὺ φιλτάτη ἐστὶν ἁπασέων.
 So saying she roused the spirit and heart of each man, and speedily the place of assembly and the seats were filled with men that gathered. And many marvelled at the sight of the wise son of Laertes, for wondrous was the grace that Athena shed upon his head and shoulders;	οὐδʼ ἀλαοσκοπιὴν εἶχε χρυσήνιος Ἄρης, ὡς ἴδεν Ἥφαιστον κλυτοτέχνην νόσφι κιόντα· βῆ δʼ ἰέναι πρὸς δῶμα περικλυτοῦ Ἡφαίστοιο ἰσχανόων φιλότητος ἐυστεφάνου Κυθερείης. ἡ δὲ νέον παρὰ πατρὸς ἐρισθενέος Κρονίωνος
 and she made him taller and sturdier to behold, that he might be welcomed by all the Phaeacians, and win awe and reverence, and might accomplish the many feats wherein the Phaeacians made trial of Odysseus. Now when they were assembled and met together,	ἐρχομένη κατʼ ἄρʼ ἕζεθʼ· ὁ δʼ εἴσω δώματος ᾔει, ἔν τʼ ἄρα οἱ φῦ χειρί, ἔπος τʼ ἔφατʼ ἔκ τʼ ὀνόμαζε· δεῦρο, φίλη, λέκτρονδε τραπείομεν εὐνηθέντες· οὐ γὰρ ἔθʼ Ἥφαιστος μεταδήμιος, ἀλλά που ἤδη οἴχεται ἐς Λῆμνον μετὰ Σίντιας ἀγριοφώνους.
Alcinous addressed their assembly and spoke among them: “Hearken to me, leaders and counsellors of the Phaeacians, that I may speak what the heart in my breast bids me. This stranger—I know not who he is—has come to my house in his wanderings, whether from men of the east or of the west.	ὣς φάτο, τῇ δʼ ἀσπαστὸν ἐείσατο κοιμηθῆναι. τὼ δʼ ἐς δέμνια βάντε κατέδραθον· ἀμφὶ δὲ δεσμοὶ τεχνήεντες ἔχυντο πολύφρονος Ἡφαίστοιο, οὐδέ τι κινῆσαι μελέων ἦν οὐδʼ ἀναεῖραι. καὶ τότε δὴ γίγνωσκον, ὅ τʼ οὐκέτι φυκτὰ πέλοντο.
 He urges that he be sent on his way, and prays for assurance, and let us on our part, as of old we were wont, speed on his sending; for verily no man soever who comes to my house, abides here long in sorrow for lack of sending. Nay come, let us draw a black ship down to the bright sea	ἀγχίμολον δέ σφʼ ἦλθε περικλυτὸς ἀμφιγυήεις, αὖτις ὑποστρέψας πρὶν Λήμνου γαῖαν ἱκέσθαι· Ἠέλιος γάρ οἱ σκοπιὴν ἔχεν εἶπέ τε μῦθον. βῆ δʼ ἴμεναι πρὸς δῶμα φίλον τετιημένος ἦτορ· ἔστη δʼ ἐν προθύροισι, χόλος δέ μιν ἄγριος ᾕρει·
for her first voyage, and let men choose two and fifty youths from out the people, even those that have heretofore been the best. And when you have all duly lashed the oars to the thole-pins, go ashore, and then go your way to my house, and prepare a feast with speed; and I will provide bountifully for all.	σμερδαλέον δʼ ἐβόησε, γέγωνέ τε πᾶσι θεοῖσιν· Ζεῦ πάτερ ἠδʼ ἄλλοι μάκαρες θεοὶ αἰὲν ἐόντες, δεῦθʼ, ἵνα ἔργα γελαστὰ καὶ οὐκ ἐπιεικτὰ ἴδησθε, ὡς ἐμὲ χωλὸν ἐόντα Διὸς θυγάτηρ Ἀφροδίτη αἰὲν ἀτιμάζει, φιλέει δʼ ἀίδηλον Ἄρηα,
 To the youths this is my command, but do you others, the sceptred kings, come to my fair palace, that we may entertain yon stranger in the halls; and let no man say me nay. And summon hither the divine minstrel, Demodocus; for to him above all others has the god granted skill in song,	οὕνεχʼ ὁ μὲν καλός τε καὶ ἀρτίπος, αὐτὰρ ἐγώ γε ἠπεδανὸς γενόμην. ἀτὰρ οὔ τί μοι αἴτιος ἄλλος, ἀλλὰ τοκῆε δύω, τὼ μὴ γείνασθαι ὄφελλον. ἀλλʼ ὄψεσθʼ, ἵνα τώ γε καθεύδετον ἐν φιλότητι εἰς ἐμὰ δέμνια βάντες, ἐγὼ δʼ ὁρόων ἀκάχημαι.
to give delight in whatever way his spirit prompts him to sing.” So saying, he led the way, and the sceptred kings followed him, while a herald went for the divine minstrel. And chosen youths, two and fifty, went, as he bade, to the shore of the unresting sea.	οὐ μέν σφεας ἔτʼ ἔολπα μίνυνθά γε κειέμεν οὕτως καὶ μάλα περ φιλέοντε· τάχʼ οὐκ ἐθελήσετον ἄμφω εὕδειν· ἀλλά σφωε δόλος καὶ δεσμὸς ἐρύξει, εἰς ὅ κέ μοι μάλα πάντα πατὴρ ἀποδῷσιν ἔεδνα, ὅσσα οἱ ἐγγυάλιξα κυνώπιδος εἵνεκα κούρης,
 And when they had come down to the ship and to the sea, they drew the black ship down to the deep water, and placed the mast and sail in the black ship, and fitted the oars in the leathern thole-straps, all in due order, and spread the white sail.	οὕνεκά οἱ καλὴ θυγάτηρ, ἀτὰρ οὐκ ἐχέθυμος. ὣς ἔφαθʼ, οἱ δʼ ἀγέροντο θεοὶ ποτὶ χαλκοβατὲς δῶ· ἦλθε Ποσειδάων γαιήοχος, ἦλθʼ ἐριούνης Ἑρμείας, ἦλθεν δὲ ἄναξ ἑκάεργος Ἀπόλλων. θηλύτεραι δὲ θεαὶ μένον αἰδοῖ οἴκοι ἑκάστη.
 Well out in the roadstead they moored the ship, and then went their way to the great palace of the wise Alcinous. Filled were the porticoes and courts and rooms with the men that gathered, for many there were, both young and old. For them Alcinous slaughtered twelve sheep,	ἔσταν δʼ ἐν προθύροισι θεοί, δωτῆρες ἑάων· ἄσβεστος δʼ ἄρʼ ἐνῶρτο γέλως μακάρεσσι θεοῖσι τέχνας εἰσορόωσι πολύφρονος Ἡφαίστοιο. ὧδε δέ τις εἴπεσκεν ἰδὼν ἐς πλησίον ἄλλον· οὐκ ἀρετᾷ κακὰ ἔργα· κιχάνει τοι βραδὺς ὠκύν,
and eight white-tusked boars, and two oxen of shambling gait. These they flayed and dressed, and made ready a goodly feast. Then the herald drew near, leading the good minstrel, whom the Muse loved above all other men, and gave him both good and evil; of his sight she deprived him, but gave him the gift of sweet song.	ὡς καὶ νῦν Ἥφαιστος ἐὼν βραδὺς εἷλεν Ἄρηα ὠκύτατόν περ ἐόντα θεῶν οἳ Ὄλυμπον ἔχουσιν, χωλὸς ἐὼν τέχνῃσι· τὸ καὶ μοιχάγριʼ ὀφέλλει. ὣς οἱ μὲν τοιαῦτα πρὸς ἀλλήλους ἀγόρευον· Ἑρμῆν δὲ προσέειπεν ἄναξ Διὸς υἱὸς Ἀπόλλων·
 For him Pontonous, the herald, set a silver-studded chair in the midst of the banqueters, leaning it against a tall pillar, and he hung the clear-toned lyre from a peg close above his head, and showed him how to reach it with his hands. And beside him he placed a basket and a beautiful table,	Ἑρμεία, Διὸς υἱέ, διάκτορε, δῶτορ ἑάων, ἦ ῥά κεν ἐν δεσμοῖς ἐθέλοις κρατεροῖσι πιεσθεὶς εὕδειν ἐν λέκτροισι παρὰ χρυσέῃ Ἀφροδίτῃ; τὸν δʼ ἠμείβετʼ ἔπειτα διάκτορος ἀργεϊφόντης· αἲ γὰρ τοῦτο γένοιτο, ἄναξ ἑκατηβόλʼ Ἄπολλον·
 and a cup of wine, to drink when his heart should bid him. So they put forth their hands to the good cheer lying ready before them. But when they had put from them the desire of food and drink, the Muse moved the minstrel to sing of the glorious deeds of warriors, from that lay the fame whereof had then reached broad heaven,	δεσμοὶ μὲν τρὶς τόσσοι ἀπείρονες ἀμφὶς ἔχοιεν, ὑμεῖς δʼ εἰσορόῳτε θεοὶ πᾶσαί τε θέαιναι, αὐτὰρ ἐγὼν εὕδοιμι παρὰ χρυσέῃ Ἀφροδίτῃ. ὣς ἔφατʼ, ἐν δὲ γέλως ὦρτʼ ἀθανάτοισι θεοῖσιν. οὐδὲ Ποσειδάωνα γέλως ἔχε, λίσσετο δʼ αἰεὶ
 even the quarrel of Odysseus and Achilles, son of Peleus, how once they strove with furious words at a rich feast of the gods, and Agamemnon, king of men, was glad at heart that the best of the Achaeans were quarrelling; for thus Phoebus Apollo, in giving his response, had told him that it should be,	Ἥφαιστον κλυτοεργὸν ὅπως λύσειεν Ἄρηα. καί μιν φωνήσας ἔπεα πτερόεντα προσηύδα· λῦσον· ἐγὼ δέ τοι αὐτὸν ὑπίσχομαι, ὡς σὺ κελεύεις, τίσειν αἴσιμα πάντα μετʼ ἀθανάτοισι θεοῖσιν. τὸν δʼ αὖτε προσέειπε περικλυτὸς ἀμφιγυήεις·
in sacred Pytho , when he passed over the threshold of stone to enquire of the oracle. For then the beginning of woe was rolling upon Trojans and Danaans through the will of great Zeus. This song the famous minstrel sang; but Odysseus grasped his great purple cloak with his stout hands,	μή με, Ποσείδαον γαιήοχε, ταῦτα κέλευε· δειλαί τοι δειλῶν γε καὶ ἐγγύαι ἐγγυάασθαι. πῶς ἂν ἐγώ σε δέοιμι μετʼ ἀθανάτοισι θεοῖσιν, εἴ κεν Ἄρης οἴχοιτο χρέος καὶ δεσμὸν ἀλύξας; τὸν δʼ αὖτε προσέειπε Ποσειδάων ἐνοσίχθων·
 and drew it down over his head, and hid his comely face; for he had shame of the Phaeacians as he let fall tears from beneath his eyebrows. Yea, and as often as the divine minstrel ceased his singing, Odysseus would wipe away his tears and draw the cloak from off his head, and taking the two-handled cup would pour libations to the gods.	Ἥφαιστʼ, εἴ περ γάρ κεν Ἄρης χρεῖος ὑπαλύξας οἴχηται φεύγων, αὐτός τοι ἐγὼ τάδε τίσω. τὸν δʼ ἠμείβετʼ ἔπειτα περικλυτὸς ἀμφιγυήεις· οὐκ ἔστʼ οὐδὲ ἔοικε τεὸν ἔπος ἀρνήσασθαι. ὣς εἰπὼν δεσμὸν ἀνίει μένος Ἡφαίστοιο.
 But as often as he began again, and the nobles of the Phaeacians bade him sing, because they took pleasure in his lay, Odysseus would again cover his head and moan. Now from all the rest he concealed the tears that he shed, but Alcinous alone marked him and took heed,	τὼ δʼ ἐπεὶ ἐκ δεσμοῖο λύθεν, κρατεροῦ περ ἐόντος, αὐτίκʼ ἀναΐξαντε ὁ μὲν Θρῄκηνδε βεβήκει, ἡ δʼ ἄρα Κύπρον ἵκανε φιλομμειδὴς Ἀφροδίτη, ἐς Πάφον· ἔνθα δέ οἱ τέμενος βωμός τε θυήεις. ἔνθα δέ μιν Χάριτες λοῦσαν καὶ χρῖσαν ἐλαίῳ
for he sat by him, and heard him groaning heavily. And straightway he spoke among the Phaeacians, lovers of the oar: “Hear me, ye leaders and counsellors of the Phaeacians, already have we satisfied our hearts with the equal banquet and with the lyre, which is the companion of the rich feast.	ἀμβρότῳ, οἷα θεοὺς ἐπενήνοθεν αἰὲν ἐόντας, ἀμφὶ δὲ εἵματα ἕσσαν ἐπήρατα, θαῦμα ἰδέσθαι. ταῦτʼ ἄρʼ ἀοιδὸς ἄειδε περικλυτός· αὐτὰρ Ὀδυσσεὺς τέρπετʼ ἐνὶ φρεσὶν ᾗσιν ἀκούων ἠδὲ καὶ ἄλλοι Φαίηκες δολιχήρετμοι, ναυσίκλυτοι ἄνδρες.
But now let us go forth, and make trial of all manner of games, that yon stranger may tell his friends, when he returns home, how far we excel other men in boxing and wrestling and leaping and in speed of foot.” So saying, he led the way, and they followed him.	Ἀλκίνοος δʼ Ἅλιον καὶ Λαοδάμαντα κέλευσεν μουνὰξ ὀρχήσασθαι, ἐπεί σφισιν οὔ τις ἔριζεν. οἱ δʼ ἐπεὶ οὖν σφαῖραν καλὴν μετὰ χερσὶν ἕλοντο, πορφυρέην, τήν σφιν Πόλυβος ποίησε δαΐφρων, τὴν ἕτερος ῥίπτασκε ποτὶ νέφεα σκιόεντα
 From the peg the herald hung the clear-toned lyre, and took Demodocus by the hand, and led him forth from the hall, guiding him by the self-same road by which the others, the nobles of the Phaeacians, had gone to gaze upon the games. They went their way to the place of assembly, and with them went a great throng,	ἰδνωθεὶς ὀπίσω, ὁ δʼ ἀπὸ χθονὸς ὑψόσʼ ἀερθεὶς ῥηιδίως μεθέλεσκε, πάρος ποσὶν οὖδας ἱκέσθαι. αὐτὰρ ἐπεὶ δὴ σφαίρῃ ἀνʼ ἰθὺν πειρήσαντο, ὠρχείσθην δὴ ἔπειτα ποτὶ χθονὶ πουλυβοτείρῃ ταρφέʼ ἀμειβομένω· κοῦροι δʼ ἐπελήκεον ἄλλοι
 past counting; and up rose many noble youths. There rose Acroneus, and Ocyalus, and Elatreus, and Nauteus, and Prymneus, and Anchialus, and Eretmeus, and Ponteus, and Proreus, Thoon and Anabesineus,	ἑστεῶτες κατʼ ἀγῶνα, πολὺς δʼ ὑπὸ κόμπος ὀρώρει. δὴ τότʼ ἄρʼ Ἀλκίνοον προσεφώνεε δῖος Ὀδυσσεύς· Ἀλκίνοε κρεῖον, πάντων ἀριδείκετε λαῶν, ἠμὲν ἀπείλησας βητάρμονας εἶναι ἀρίστους, ἠδʼ ἄρʼ ἑτοῖμα τέτυκτο· σέβας μʼ ἔχει εἰσορόωντα.
 and Amphialus, son of Polyneus, son of Tecton; and up rose also Euryalus, the peer of man-destroying Ares, the son of Naubolus, who in comeliness and form was the best of all the Phaeacians after peerless Laodamas; and up rose the three sons of noble Alcinous, Laodamas, and Halius, and godlike Clytoneus.	ὣς φάτο, γήθησεν δʼ ἱερὸν μένος Ἀλκινόοιο, αἶψα δὲ Φαιήκεσσι φιληρέτμοισι μετηύδα· κέκλυτε, Φαιήκων ἡγήτορες ἠδὲ μέδοντες. ὁ ξεῖνος μάλα μοι δοκέει πεπνυμένος εἶναι. ἀλλʼ ἄγε οἱ δῶμεν ξεινήιον, ὡς ἐπιεικές.
These then first made trial in the foot-race. A course was marked out for them from the turning point, and they all sped swiftly, raising the dust of the plain; but among them noble Clytoneus was far the best at running, and by as far as is the range of a team of mules in fallow land,	δώδεκα γὰρ κατὰ δῆμον ἀριπρεπέες βασιλῆες ἀρχοὶ κραίνουσι, τρισκαιδέκατος δʼ ἐγὼ αὐτός· τῶν οἱ ἕκαστος φᾶρος ἐυπλυνὲς ἠδὲ χιτῶνα καὶ χρυσοῖο τάλαντον ἐνείκατε τιμήεντος. αἶψα δὲ πάντα φέρωμεν ἀολλέα, ὄφρʼ ἐνὶ χερσὶν
 by so far he shot to the front and reached the host, and the others were left behind. Then they made trial of toilsome wrestling, and here in turn Euryalus excelled all the princes. And in leaping Amphialus was best of all, and with the discus again far the best of all was Elatreus,	ξεῖνος ἔχων ἐπὶ δόρπον ἴῃ χαίρων ἐνὶ θυμῷ. Εὐρύαλος δέ ἑ αὐτὸν ἀρεσσάσθω ἐπέεσσι καὶ δώρῳ, ἐπεὶ οὔ τι ἔπος κατὰ μοῖραν ἔειπεν. ὣς ἔφαθʼ, οἱ δʼ ἄρα πάντες ἐπῄνεον ἠδʼ ἐκέλευον, δῶρα δʼ ἄρʼ οἰσέμεναι πρόεσαν κήρυκα ἕκαστος.
and in boxing Laodamas, the good son of Alcinous. But when the hearts of all had taken pleasure in the contests, Laodamas, the son of Alcinous, spoke among them: “Come, friends, let us ask yon stranger whether he knows and has learned any contests. In build, surely, he is no mean man,	τὸν δʼ αὖτʼ Εὐρύαλος ἀπαμείβετο φώνησέν τε· Ἀλκίνοε κρεῖον, πάντων ἀριδείκετε λαῶν, τοιγὰρ ἐγὼ τὸν ξεῖνον ἀρέσσομαι, ὡς σὺ κελεύεις. δώσω οἱ τόδʼ ἄορ παγχάλκεον, ᾧ ἔπι κώπη ἀργυρέη, κολεὸν δὲ νεοπρίστου ἐλέφαντος
in thighs and calves, and in his two arms above, his stout neck, and his great might. In no wise does he lack aught of the strength of youth, but he has been broken by many troubles. For to my mind there is naught worse than the sea to confound a man, be he never so strong.”	ἀμφιδεδίνηται· πολέος δέ οἱ ἄξιον ἔσται. ὣς εἰπὼν ἐν χερσὶ τίθει ξίφος ἀργυρόηλον καί μιν φωνήσας ἔπεα πτερόεντα προσηύδα· χαῖρε, πάτερ ὦ ξεῖνε· ἔπος δʼ εἴ πέρ τι βέβακται δεινόν, ἄφαρ τὸ φέροιεν ἀναρπάξασαι ἄελλαι.
And Euryalus in turn answered him, and said:“Laodamas, this word of thine is right fitly spoken. Go now thyself and challenge him, and make known thy word.” Now when the good son of Alcinous heard this he came and took his stand in the midst and spoke to Odysseus:	σοὶ δὲ θεοὶ ἄλοχόν τʼ ἰδέειν καὶ πατρίδʼ ἱκέσθαι δοῖεν, ἐπεὶ δὴ δηθὰ φίλων ἄπο πήματα πάσχεις. τὸν δʼ ἀπαμειβόμενος προσέφη πολύμητις Ὀδυσσεύς· καὶ σὺ φίλος μάλα χαῖρε, θεοὶ δέ τοι ὄλβια δοῖεν. μηδέ τι τοι ξίφεός γε ποθὴ μετόπισθε γένοιτο
 “Come, Sir stranger, do thou, too, make trial of the contests, if thou knowest any; and it must be that thou knowest contests, for there is no greater glory for a man so long as he lives than that which he achieves by his own hands and his feet. Nay, come, make trial, and cast away care from thy heart.	τούτου, ὃ δή μοι δῶκας ἀρεσσάμενος ἐπέεσσιν. ἦ ῥα καὶ ἀμφʼ ὤμοισι θέτο ξίφος ἀργυρόηλον. δύσετό τʼ ἠέλιος, καὶ τῷ κλυτὰ δῶρα παρῆεν. καὶ τά γʼ ἐς Ἀλκινόοιο φέρον κήρυκες ἀγαυοί· δεξάμενοι δʼ ἄρα παῖδες ἀμύμονος Ἀλκινόοιο
Thy journey shall no more be long delayed, nay, even now thy ship is launched and the crew is ready.” Then Odysseus of many wiles answered him, and said: “Laodamas, why do ye mock me with this challenge? Sorrow is in my mind far more than contests,	μητρὶ παρʼ αἰδοίῃ ἔθεσαν περικαλλέα δῶρα. τοῖσιν δʼ ἡγεμόνευʼ ἱερὸν μένος Ἀλκινόοιο, ἐλθόντες δὲ καθῖζον ἐν ὑψηλοῖσι θρόνοισι. δή ῥα τότʼ Ἀρήτην προσέφη μένος Ἀλκινόοιο· δεῦρο, γύναι, φέρε χηλὸν ἀριπρεπέʼ, ἥ τις ἀρίστη·
seeing that in time past I have suffered much and toiled much, and now I sit in the midst of your assembly, longing for my return home, and making my prayer to the king and to all the people.” Then again Euryalus made answer and taunted him to his face: “Nay verily, stranger, for I do not liken thee to a man that is skilled	ἐν δʼ αὐτὴ θὲς φᾶρος ἐυπλυνὲς ἠδὲ χιτῶνα. ἀμφὶ δέ οἱ πυρὶ χαλκὸν ἰήνατε, θέρμετε δʼ ὕδωρ, ὄφρα λοεσσάμενός τε ἰδών τʼ ἐὺ κείμενα πάντα δῶρα, τά οἱ Φαίηκες ἀμύμονες ἐνθάδʼ ἔνεικαν, δαιτί τε τέρπηται καὶ ἀοιδῆς ὕμνον ἀκούων.
in contests, such as abound among men, but to one who, faring to and fro with his benched ship, is a captain of sailors who are merchantmen, one who is mindful of his freight, and has charge of a home-borne cargo, and the gains of his greed. Thou dost not look like an athlete.”	καί οἱ ἐγὼ τόδʼ ἄλεισον ἐμὸν περικαλλὲς ὀπάσσω, χρύσεον, ὄφρʼ ἐμέθεν μεμνημένος ἤματα πάντα σπένδῃ ἐνὶ μεγάρῳ Διί τʼ ἄλλοισίν τε θεοῖσιν. ὣς ἔφατʼ, Ἀρήτη δὲ μετὰ δμῳῇσιν ἔειπεν ἀμφὶ πυρὶ στῆσαι τρίποδα μέγαν ὅττι τάχιστα.
 Then with an angry glance from beneath his brows Odysseus of many wiles answered him: “Stranger, thou hast not spoken well; thou art as one blind with folly. So true is it that the gods do not give gracious gifts to all alike, not form nor mind nor eloquence. For one man is inferior in comeliness,	αἱ δὲ λοετροχόον τρίποδʼ ἵστασαν ἐν πυρὶ κηλέῳ, ἔν δʼ ἄρʼ ὕδωρ ἔχεαν, ὑπὸ δὲ ξύλα δαῖον ἑλοῦσαι. γάστρην μὲν τρίποδος πῦρ ἄμφεπε, θέρμετο δʼ ὕδωρ· τόφρα δʼ ἄρʼ Ἀρήτη ξείνῳ περικαλλέα χηλὸν ἐξέφερεν θαλάμοιο, τίθει δʼ ἐνὶ κάλλιμα δῶρα,
but the god sets a crown of beauty upon his words, and men look upon him with delight, and he speaks on unfalteringly with sweet modesty, and is conspicuous among the gathered people, and as he goes through the city men gaze upon him as upon a god. Another again is in comeliness like the immortals,	ἐσθῆτα χρυσόν τε, τά οἱ Φαίηκες ἔδωκαν· ἐν δʼ αὐτὴ φᾶρος θῆκεν καλόν τε χιτῶνα, καί μιν φωνήσασʼ ἔπεα πτερόεντα προσηύδα· αὐτὸς νῦν ἴδε πῶμα, θοῶς δʼ ἐπὶ δεσμὸν ἴηλον, μή τίς τοι καθʼ ὁδὸν δηλήσεται, ὁππότʼ ἂν αὖτε εὕδῃσθα γλυκὺν ὕπνον ἰὼν ἐν νηὶ μελαίνῃ. αὐτὰρ ἐπεὶ τό γʼ ἄκουσε πολύτλας δῖος Ὀδυσσεύς, αὐτίκʼ ἐπήρτυε πῶμα, θοῶς δʼ ἐπὶ δεσμὸν ἴηλεν ποικίλον, ὅν ποτέ μιν δέδαε φρεσὶ πότνια Κίρκη· αὐτόδιον δʼ ἄρα μιν ταμίη λούσασθαι ἀνώγει ἔς ῥʼ ἀσάμινθον βάνθʼ· ὁ δʼ ἄρ ἀσπασίως ἴδε θυμῷ θερμὰ λοέτρʼ, ἐπεὶ οὔ τι κομιζόμενός γε θάμιζεν, ἐπεὶ δὴ λίπε δῶμα Καλυψοῦς ἠυκόμοιο. τόφρα δέ οἱ κομιδή γε θεῷ ὣς ἔμπεδος ἦεν. τὸν δʼ ἐπεὶ οὖν δμῳαὶ λοῦσαν καὶ χρῖσαν ἐλαίῳ, ἀμφὶ δέ μιν χλαῖναν καλὴν βάλον ἠδὲ χιτῶνα, ἔκ ῥʼ ἀσαμίνθου βὰς ἄνδρας μέτα οἰνοποτῆρας ἤιε· Ναυσικάα δὲ θεῶν ἄπο κάλλος ἔχουσα στῆ ῥα παρὰ σταθμὸν τέγεος πύκα ποιητοῖο, θαύμαζεν δʼ Ὀδυσῆα ἐν ὀφθαλμοῖσιν ὁρῶσα, καί μιν φωνήσασʼ ἔπεα πτερόεντα προσηύδα· χαῖρε, ξεῖνʼ, ἵνα καί ποτʼ ἐὼν ἐν πατρίδι γαίῃ μνήσῃ ἐμεῦ, ὅτι μοι πρώτῃ ζωάγριʼ ὀφέλλεις. τὴν δʼ ἀπαμειβόμενος προσέφη πολύμητις Ὀδυσσεύς.

 but no crown of grace is set about his words. So, in thy case, thy comeliness is preeminent, nor could a god himself mend it, but in mind thou art stunted. Thou hast stirred the spirit in my breast by speaking thus unmannerly. I am not unskilled in sports	εἴπʼ ὄνομʼ ὅττι σε κεῖθι κάλεον μήτηρ τε πατήρ τε ἄλλοι θʼ οἳ κατὰ ἄστυ καὶ οἳ περιναιετάουσιν. οὐ μὲν γάρ τις πάμπαν ἀνώνυμός ἐστʼ ἀνθρώπων, οὐ κακὸς οὐδὲ μὲν ἐσθλός, ἐπὴν τὰ πρῶτα γένηται, ἀλλʼ ἐπὶ πᾶσι τίθενται, ἐπεί κε τέκωσι, τοκῆες. εἰπὲ δέ μοι γαῖάν τε· τεὴν δῆμόν τε πόλιν τε, ὄφρα σε τῇ πέμπωσι τιτυσκόμεναι φρεσὶ νῆες· οὐ γὰρ Φαιήκεσσι κυβερνητῆρες ἔασιν, οὐδέ τι πηδάλιʼ ἔστι, τά τʼ ἄλλαι νῆες ἔχουσιν· ἀλλʼ αὐταὶ ἴσασι νοήματα καὶ φρένας ἀνδρῶν, καὶ πάντων ἴσασι πόλιας καὶ πίονας ἀγροὺς ἀνθρώπων, καὶ λαῖτμα τάχισθʼ ἁλὸς ἐκπερόωσιν ἠέρι καὶ νεφέλῃ κεκαλυμμέναι· οὐδέ ποτέ σφιν οὔτε τι πημανθῆναι ἔπι δέος οὔτʼ ἀπολέσθαι. ἀλλὰ τόδʼ ὥς ποτε πατρὸς ἐγὼν εἰπόντος ἄκουσα Ναυσιθόου, ὃς ἔφασκε Ποσειδάωνʼ ἀγάσασθαι ἡμῖν, οὕνεκα πομποὶ ἀπήμονές εἰμεν ἁπάντων. φῆ ποτὲ Φαιήκων ἀνδρῶν ἐυεργέα νῆα ἐκ πομπῆς ἀνιοῦσαν ἐν ἠεροειδέι πόντῳ ῥαισέμεναι, μέγα δʼ ἧμιν ὄρος πόλει ἀμφικαλύψειν. ὣς ἀγόρευʼ ὁ γέρων· τὰ δέ κεν θεὸς ἢ τελέσειεν ἤ κʼ ἀτέλεστʼ εἴη, ὥς οἱ φίλον ἔπλετο θυμῷ· ἀλλʼ ἄγε μοι τόδε εἰπὲ καὶ ἀτρεκέως κατάλεξον, ὅππῃ ἀπεπλάγχθης τε καὶ ἅς τινας ἵκεο χώρας ἀνθρώπων, αὐτούς τε πόλιάς τʼ ἐὺ ναιετοώσας, ἠμὲν ὅσοι χαλεποί τε καὶ ἄγριοι οὐδὲ δίκαιοι, οἵ τε φιλόξεινοι, καί σφιν νόος ἐστὶ θεουδής. εἰπὲ δʼ ὅ τι κλαίεις καὶ ὀδύρεαι ἔνδοθι θυμῷ Ἀργείων Δαναῶν ἠδʼ Ἰλίου οἶτον ἀκούων. τὸν δὲ θεοὶ μὲν τεῦξαν, ἐπεκλώσαντο δʼ ὄλεθρον ἀνθρώποις, ἵνα ᾖσι καὶ ἐσσομένοισιν ἀοιδή. ἦ τίς τοι καὶ πηὸς ἀπέφθιτο Ἰλιόθι πρὸ ἐσθλὸς ἐών, γαμβρὸς ἢ πενθερός, οἵ τε μάλιστα κήδιστοι τελέθουσι μεθʼ αἷμά τε καὶ γένος αὐτῶν; ἦ τίς που καὶ ἑταῖρος ἀνὴρ κεχαρισμένα εἰδώς, ἐσθλός; ἐπεὶ οὐ μέν τι κασιγνήτοιο χερείων γίγνεται, ὅς κεν ἑταῖρος ἐὼν πεπνυμένα εἰδῇ.
for thy word has stung me to the heart, and thou hast provoked me with thy speech.” He spoke, and, leaping up with his cloak about him as it was, seized a discus larger than the rest and thick, no little heavier than those with which the Phaeacians were wont to contend one with another. This with a whirl he sent from his stout hand,	τὸν δʼ ἀπαμειβόμενος προσέφη πολύμητις Ὀδυσσεύς· Ἀλκίνοε κρεῖον, πάντων ἀριδείκετε λαῶν, ἦ τοι μὲν τόδε καλὸν ἀκουέμεν ἐστὶν ἀοιδοῦ τοιοῦδʼ οἷος ὅδʼ ἐστί, θεοῖς ἐναλίγκιος αὐδήν.
and the stone hummed as it flew; and down they crouched to the earth, the Phaeacians of the long oars, men famed for their ships, beneath the rush of the stone. Past the marks of all it flew, speeding lightly from his hand, and Athena, in the likeness of a man, set the mark, and she spoke and addressed him:	οὐ γὰρ ἐγώ γέ τί φημι τέλος χαριέστερον εἶναι ἢ ὅτʼ ἐυφροσύνη μὲν ἔχῃ κάτα δῆμον ἅπαντα, δαιτυμόνες δʼ ἀνὰ δώματʼ ἀκουάζωνται ἀοιδοῦ ἥμενοι ἑξείης, παρὰ δὲ πλήθωσι τράπεζαι σίτου καὶ κρειῶν, μέθυ δʼ ἐκ κρητῆρος ἀφύσσων
“Even a blind man, stranger, could distinguish this mark, groping for it with his hands, for it is in nowise confused with the throng of the others, but is far the first. Be thou of good cheer for this bout at least: no one of the Phaeacians will reach this, or cast beyond it.” So she spoke, and the much-enduring goodly Odysseus was glad,	οἰνοχόος φορέῃσι καὶ ἐγχείῃ δεπάεσσι· τοῦτό τί μοι κάλλιστον ἐνὶ φρεσὶν εἴδεται εἶναι. σοὶ δʼ ἐμὰ κήδεα θυμὸς ἐπετράπετο στονόεντα εἴρεσθʼ, ὄφρʼ ἔτι μᾶλλον ὀδυρόμενος στεναχίζω· τί πρῶτόν τοι ἔπειτα, τί δʼ ὑστάτιον καταλέξω;
rejoicing that he saw a true friend in the lists. Then with a lighter heart he spoke among the Phaeacians: “Reach this now, young men; and presently, methinks, I will send another after it, as far or even further. Of the rest, if any man's heart and spirit bid him,	κήδεʼ ἐπεί μοι πολλὰ δόσαν θεοὶ Οὐρανίωνες. νῦν δʼ ὄνομα πρῶτον μυθήσομαι, ὄφρα καὶ ὑμεῖς εἴδετʼ, ἐγὼ δʼ ἂν ἔπειτα φυγὼν ὕπο νηλεὲς ἦμαρ ὑμῖν ξεῖνος ἔω καὶ ἀπόπροθι δώματα ναίων. εἴμʼ Ὀδυσεὺς Λαερτιάδης, ὃς πᾶσι δόλοισιν
 let him come hither and make trial—for ye have greatly angered me—be it in boxing or in wrestling, aye, or in running, I care not; let any one come of all the Phaeacians, save Laodamas alone. For he is my host, and who would quarrel with one that entertains him? Foolish is that man and worthless,	ἀνθρώποισι μέλω, καί μευ κλέος οὐρανὸν ἵκει. ναιετάω δʼ Ἰθάκην ἐυδείελον· ἐν δʼ ὄρος αὐτῇ Νήριτον εἰνοσίφυλλον, ἀριπρεπές· ἀμφὶ δὲ νῆσοι πολλαὶ ναιετάουσι μάλα σχεδὸν ἀλλήλῃσι, Δουλίχιόν τε Σάμη τε καὶ ὑλήεσσα Ζάκυνθος.
 who challenges to a contest the host who receives him in a strange land; he does but mar his own fortunes. But of all the rest I refuse none, and make light of none, but am fain to know them, and make trial of them man to man. For in all things I am no weakling, even in all the contests that are practised among men.	αὐτὴ δὲ χθαμαλὴ πανυπερτάτη εἰν ἁλὶ κεῖται πρὸς ζόφον, αἱ δέ τʼ ἄνευθε πρὸς ἠῶ τʼ ἠέλιόν τε, τρηχεῖʼ, ἀλλʼ ἀγαθὴ κουροτρόφος· οὔ τοι ἐγώ γε ἧς γαίης δύναμαι γλυκερώτερον ἄλλο ἰδέσθαι. ἦ μέν μʼ αὐτόθʼ ἔρυκε Καλυψώ, δῖα θεάων,
 Well do I know how to handle the polished bow, and ever would I be the first to shoot and smite my man in the throng of the foe, even though many comrades stood by me and were shooting at the men. Only Philoctetes excelled me with the bow	ἐν σπέσσι γλαφυροῖσι, λιλαιομένη πόσιν εἶναι· ὣς δʼ αὔτως Κίρκη κατερήτυεν ἐν μεγάροισιν Αἰαίη δολόεσσα, λιλαιομένη πόσιν εἶναι· ἀλλʼ ἐμὸν οὔ ποτε θυμὸν ἐνὶ στήθεσσιν ἔπειθον. ὣς οὐδὲν γλύκιον ἧς πατρίδος οὐδὲ τοκήων
in the land of the Trojans, when we Achaeans shot. But of all others I declare that I am best by far, of all mortals that are now upon the earth and eat bread. Yet with men of former days I will not seek to vie, with Heracles or with Eurytus of Oechalia ,	γίγνεται, εἴ περ καί τις ἀπόπροθι πίονα οἶκον γαίῃ ἐν ἀλλοδαπῇ ναίει ἀπάνευθε τοκήων. εἰ δʼ ἄγε τοι καὶ νόστον ἐμὸν πολυκηδέʼ ἐνίσπω, ὅν μοι Ζεὺς ἐφέηκεν ἀπὸ Τροίηθεν ἰόντι. Ἰλιόθεν με φέρων ἄνεμος Κικόνεσσι πέλασσεν,
 who strove even with the immortals in archery. Wherefore great Eurytus died soon, nor did old age come upon him in his halls, for Apollo waxed wroth and slew him, because he had challenged him to a contest with the bow. And with the spear I throw farther than any other man can shoot with an arrow.	Ἰσμάρῳ. ἔνθα δʼ ἐγὼ πόλιν ἔπραθον, ὤλεσα δʼ αὐτούς· ἐκ πόλιος δʼ ἀλόχους καὶ κτήματα πολλὰ λαβόντες δασσάμεθʼ, ὡς μή τίς μοι ἀτεμβόμενος κίοι ἴσης. ἔνθʼ ἦ τοι μὲν ἐγὼ διερῷ ποδὶ φευγέμεν ἡμέας ἠνώγεα, τοὶ δὲ μέγα νήπιοι οὐκ ἐπίθοντο.
In the foot race alone I fear that someone of the Phaeacians may out strip me, for cruelly have I been broken amid the many waves, since there was in my ship no lasting store of provisions; therefore my limbs are loosened.” So he spoke and they were all hushed in silence;	ἔνθα δὲ πολλὸν μὲν μέθυ πίνετο, πολλὰ δὲ μῆλα ἔσφαζον παρὰ θῖνα καὶ εἰλίποδας ἕλικας βοῦς· τόφρα δʼ ἄρʼ οἰχόμενοι Κίκονες Κικόνεσσι γεγώνευν, οἵ σφιν γείτονες ἦσαν, ἅμα πλέονες καὶ ἀρείους, ἤπειρον ναίοντες, ἐπιστάμενοι μὲν ἀφʼ ἵππων
but Alcinous alone answered him and said: “Stranger, since not ungraciously dost thou speak thus in our midst, but art minded to shew forth the prowess which waits upon thee, in anger that yonder man came up to thee in the lists and taunted thee in a way in which no mortal would make light of thy prowess,	ἀνδράσι μάρνασθαι καὶ ὅθι χρὴ πεζὸν ἐόντα. ἦλθον ἔπειθʼ ὅσα φύλλα καὶ ἄνθεα γίγνεται ὥρῃ, ἠέριοι· τότε δή ῥα κακὴ Διὸς αἶσα παρέστη ἡμῖν αἰνομόροισιν, ἵνʼ ἄλγεα πολλὰ πάθοιμεν. στησάμενοι δʼ ἐμάχοντο μάχην παρὰ νηυσὶ θοῇσι,
 who knew in his heart how to speak fitly; come, now, hearken to my words, that thou mayest tell to another hero, when in thy halls thou art feasting with thy wife and children, and rememberest our skill, what feats	βάλλον δʼ ἀλλήλους χαλκήρεσιν ἐγχείῃσιν. ὄφρα μὲν ἠὼς ἦν καὶ ἀέξετο ἱερὸν ἦμαρ, τόφρα δʼ ἀλεξόμενοι μένομεν πλέονάς περ ἐόντας. ἦμος δʼ ἠέλιος μετενίσσετο βουλυτόνδε, καὶ τότε δὴ Κίκονες κλῖναν δαμάσαντες Ἀχαιούς.
Zeus has vouchsafed to us from our fathers' days even until now. For we are not faultless boxers or wrestlers, but in the foot race we run swiftly, and we are the best seamen; and ever to us is the banquet dear, and the lyre, and the dance, and changes of raiment, and warm baths, and the couch.	ἓξ δʼ ἀφʼ ἑκάστης νηὸς ἐυκνήμιδες ἑταῖροι ὤλονθʼ· οἱ δʼ ἄλλοι φύγομεν θάνατόν τε μόρον τε. ἔνθεν δὲ προτέρω πλέομεν ἀκαχήμενοι ἦτορ, ἄσμενοι ἐκ θανάτοιο, φίλους ὀλέσαντες ἑταίρους. οὐδʼ ἄρα μοι προτέρω νῆες κίον ἀμφιέλισσαι,
 But come now, all ye that are the best dancers of the Phaeacians, make sport, that the stranger may tell his friends on reaching home how far we surpass others in seamanship and in fleetness of foot, and in the dance and in song. And let one go straightway	πρίν τινα τῶν δειλῶν ἑτάρων τρὶς ἕκαστον ἀῦσαι, οἳ θάνον ἐν πεδίῳ Κικόνων ὕπο δῃωθέντες. νηυσὶ δʼ ἐπῶρσʼ ἄνεμον Βορέην νεφεληγερέτα Ζεὺς λαίλαπι θεσπεσίῃ, σὺν δὲ νεφέεσσι κάλυψε γαῖαν ὁμοῦ καὶ πόντον· ὀρώρει δʼ οὐρανόθεν νύξ.
and fetch for Demodocus the clear-toned lyre which lies somewhere in our halls.” So spoke Alcinous the godlike, and the herald rose to fetch the hollow lyre from the palace of the king. Then stood up masters of the lists, nine in all, men chosen from out the people, who in their gatherings were wont to order all things aright.	αἱ μὲν ἔπειτʼ ἐφέροντʼ ἐπικάρσιαι, ἱστία δέ σφιν τριχθά τε καὶ τετραχθὰ διέσχισεν ἲς ἀνέμοιο. καὶ τὰ μὲν ἐς νῆας κάθεμεν, δείσαντες ὄλεθρον, αὐτὰς δʼ ἐσσυμένως προερέσσαμεν ἤπειρόνδε. ἔνθα δύω νύκτας δύο τʼ ἤματα συνεχὲς αἰεὶ
 They levelled a place for the dance, and marked out a fair wide ring, and the herald came near, bearing the clear-toned lyre for Demodocus. He then moved into the midst, and around him stood boys in the first bloom of youth, well skilled in the dance, and they smote the goodly dancing floor with their feet. And Odysseus	κείμεθʼ, ὁμοῦ καμάτῳ τε καὶ ἄλγεσι θυμὸν ἔδοντες. ἀλλʼ ὅτε δὴ τρίτον ἦμαρ ἐυπλόκαμος τέλεσʼ Ἠώς, ἱστοὺς στησάμενοι ἀνά θʼ ἱστία λεύκʼ ἐρύσαντες ἥμεθα, τὰς δʼ ἄνεμός τε κυβερνῆταί τʼ ἴθυνον. καί νύ κεν ἀσκηθὴς ἱκόμην ἐς πατρίδα γαῖαν·
gazed at the twinklings of their feet and marvelled in spirit. But the minstrel struck the chords in prelude to his sweet lay and sang of the love of Ares and Aphrodite of the fair crown, how first they lay together in the house of Hephaestus secretly; and Ares gave her many gifts, and shamed the bed	ἀλλά με κῦμα ῥόος τε περιγνάμπτοντα Μάλειαν καὶ Βορέης ἀπέωσε, παρέπλαγξεν δὲ Κυθήρων. ἔνθεν δʼ ἐννῆμαρ φερόμην ὀλοοῖς ἀνέμοισιν πόντον ἐπʼ ἰχθυόεντα· ἀτὰρ δεκάτῃ ἐπέβημεν γαίης Λωτοφάγων, οἵ τʼ ἄνθινον εἶδαρ ἔδουσιν.
 of the lord Hephaestus. But straightway one came to him with tidings, even Helius, who had marked them as they lay together in love. And when Hephaestus heard the grievous tale, he went his way to his smithy, pondering evil in the deep of his heart, and set on the anvil block the great anvil and forged bonds	ἔνθα δʼ ἐπʼ ἠπείρου βῆμεν καὶ ἀφυσσάμεθʼ ὕδωρ, αἶψα δὲ δεῖπνον ἕλοντο θοῇς παρὰ νηυσὶν ἑταῖροι. αὐτὰρ ἐπεὶ σίτοιό τʼ ἐπασσάμεθʼ ἠδὲ ποτῆτος, δὴ τοτʼ ἐγὼν ἑτάρους προΐειν πεύθεσθαι ἰόντας, οἵ τινες ἀνέρες εἶεν ἐπὶ χθονὶ σῖτον ἔδοντες
which might not be broken or loosed, that the lovers might bide fast where they were. But when he had fashioned the snare in his wrath against Ares, he went to his chamber where lay his bed, and everywhere round about the bed-posts he spread the bonds, and many too were hung from above, from the roof-beams,	ἄνδρε δύω κρίνας, τρίτατον κήρυχʼ ἅμʼ ὀπάσσας. οἱ δʼ αἶψʼ οἰχόμενοι μίγεν ἀνδράσι Λωτοφάγοισιν· οὐδʼ ἄρα Λωτοφάγοι μήδονθʼ ἑτάροισιν ὄλεθρον ἡμετέροις, ἀλλά σφι δόσαν λωτοῖο πάσασθαι. τῶν δʼ ὅς τις λωτοῖο φάγοι μελιηδέα καρπόν,
fine as spiders' webs, so that no one even of the blessed gods could see them, so exceeding craftily were they fashioned. But when he had spread all his snare about the couch, he made as though he would go to Lemnos , that well-built citadel, which is in his eyes far the dearest of all lands.	οὐκέτʼ ἀπαγγεῖλαι πάλιν ἤθελεν οὐδὲ νέεσθαι, ἀλλʼ αὐτοῦ βούλοντο μετʼ ἀνδράσι Λωτοφάγοισι λωτὸν ἐρεπτόμενοι μενέμεν νόστου τε λαθέσθαι. τοὺς μὲν ἐγὼν ἐπὶ νῆας ἄγον κλαίοντας ἀνάγκῃ, νηυσὶ δʼ ἐνὶ γλαφυρῇσιν ὑπὸ ζυγὰ δῆσα ἐρύσσας.
 And no blind watch did Ares of the golden rein keep, when he saw Hephaestus, famed for his handicraft, departing, but he went his way to the house of famous Hephaestus, eager for the love of Cytherea of the fair crown. Now she had but newly come from the presence of her father, the mighty son of Cronos,	αὐτὰρ τοὺς ἄλλους κελόμην ἐρίηρας ἑταίρους σπερχομένους νηῶν ἐπιβαινέμεν ὠκειάων, μή πώς τις λωτοῖο φαγὼν νόστοιο λάθηται. οἱ δʼ αἶψʼ εἴσβαινον καὶ ἐπὶ κληῖσι καθῖζον, ἑξῆς δʼ ἑζόμενοι πολιὴν ἅλα τύπτον ἐρετμοῖς.
and had sat her down. And Ares came into the house and clasped her hand and spoke and addressed her: “Come, love, let us to bed and take our joy, couched together. For Hephaestus is no longer here in the land, but has now gone, I ween, to Lemnos , to visit the Sintians of savage speech.”	ἔνθεν δὲ προτέρω πλέομεν ἀκαχήμενοι ἦτορ· Κυκλώπων δʼ ἐς γαῖαν ὑπερφιάλων ἀθεμίστων ἱκόμεθʼ, οἵ ῥα θεοῖσι πεποιθότες ἀθανάτοισιν οὔτε φυτεύουσιν χερσὶν φυτὸν οὔτʼ ἀρόωσιν, ἀλλὰ τά γʼ ἄσπαρτα καὶ ἀνήροτα πάντα φύονται,
 So he spoke, and a welcome thing it seemed to her to lie with him. So they two went to the couch, and lay them down to sleep, and about them clung the cunning bonds of the wise Hephaestus, nor could they in any wise stir their limbs or raise them up. Then at length they learned that there was no more escaping.	πυροὶ καὶ κριθαὶ ἠδʼ ἄμπελοι, αἵ τε φέρουσιν οἶνον ἐριστάφυλον, καί σφιν Διὸς ὄμβρος ἀέξει. τοῖσιν δʼ οὔτʼ ἀγοραὶ βουληφόροι οὔτε θέμιστες, ἀλλʼ οἵ γʼ ὑψηλῶν ὀρέων ναίουσι κάρηνα ἐν σπέσσι γλαφυροῖσι, θεμιστεύει δὲ ἕκαστος
And near to them came the famous god of the two strong arms, having turned back before he reached the land of Lemnos ; for Helius had kept watch for him and had brought him word. So he went to his house with a heavy heart, and stood at the gateway, and fierce anger seized him.	παίδων ἠδʼ ἀλόχων, οὐδʼ ἀλλήλων ἀλέγουσιν. νῆσος ἔπειτα λάχεια παρὲκ λιμένος τετάνυσται, γαίης Κυκλώπων οὔτε σχεδὸν οὔτʼ ἀποτηλοῦ, ὑλήεσσʼ· ἐν δʼ αἶγες ἀπειρέσιαι γεγάασιν ἄγριαι· οὐ μὲν γὰρ πάτος ἀνθρώπων ἀπερύκει,
And terribly he cried out and called to all the gods: “Father Zeus, and ye other blessed gods that are forever, come hither that ye may see a laughable matter and a monstrous, even how Aphrodite, daughter of Zeus, scorns me for that I am lame and loves destructive Ares	οὐδέ μιν εἰσοιχνεῦσι κυνηγέται, οἵ τε καθʼ ὕλην ἄλγεα πάσχουσιν κορυφὰς ὀρέων ἐφέποντες. οὔτʼ ἄρα ποίμνῃσιν καταΐσχεται οὔτʼ ἀρότοισιν, ἀλλʼ ἥ γʼ ἄσπαρτος καὶ ἀνήροτος ἤματα πάντα ἀνδρῶν χηρεύει, βόσκει δέ τε μηκάδας αἶγας.
 because he is comely and strong of limb, whereas I was born misshapen. Yet for this is none other to blame but my two parents—would they had never begotten me! But ye shall see where these two have gone up into my bed and sleep together in love; and I am troubled at the sight.	οὐ γὰρ Κυκλώπεσσι νέες πάρα μιλτοπάρῃοι, οὐδʼ ἄνδρες νηῶν ἔνι τέκτονες, οἵ κε κάμοιεν νῆας ἐυσσέλμους, αἵ κεν τελέοιεν ἕκαστα ἄστεʼ ἐπʼ ἀνθρώπων ἱκνεύμεναι, οἷά τε πολλὰ ἄνδρες ἐπʼ ἀλλήλους νηυσὶν περόωσι θάλασσαν·
 Yet, methinks, they will not wish to lie longer thus, no, not for a moment, how loving soever they are. Soon shall both lose their desire to sleep; but the snare and the bonds shall hold them until her father pays back to me all the gifts of wooing that I gave him for the sake of his shameless girl;	οἵ κέ σφιν καὶ νῆσον ἐυκτιμένην ἐκάμοντο. οὐ μὲν γάρ τι κακή γε, φέροι δέ κεν ὥρια πάντα· ἐν μὲν γὰρ λειμῶνες ἁλὸς πολιοῖο παρʼ ὄχθας ὑδρηλοὶ μαλακοί· μάλα κʼ ἄφθιτοι ἄμπελοι εἶεν. ἐν δʼ ἄροσις λείη· μάλα κεν βαθὺ λήιον αἰεὶ
for his daughter is fair but bridles not her passion.” So he spoke and the gods gathered to the house of the brazen floor. Poseidon came, the earth-enfolder, and the helper Hermes came, and the lord Apollo, the archer god. Now the goddesses abode for shame each in her own house,	εἰς ὥρας ἀμῷεν, ἐπεὶ μάλα πῖαρ ὑπʼ οὖδας. ἐν δὲ λιμὴν ἐύορμος, ἵνʼ οὐ χρεὼ πείσματός ἐστιν, οὔτʼ εὐνὰς βαλέειν οὔτε πρυμνήσιʼ ἀνάψαι, ἀλλʼ ἐπικέλσαντας μεῖναι χρόνον εἰς ὅ κε ναυτέων θυμὸς ἐποτρύνῃ καὶ ἐπιπνεύσωσιν ἀῆται.
but the gods, the givers of good things, stood in the gateway; and unquenchable laughter arose among the blessed gods as they saw the craft of wise Hephaestus. And thus would one speak, with a glance at his neighbor: “Ill deeds thrive not. The slow catches the swift;	αὐτὰρ ἐπὶ κρατὸς λιμένος ῥέει ἀγλαὸν ὕδωρ, κρήνη ὑπὸ σπείους· περὶ δʼ αἴγειροι πεφύασιν. ἔνθα κατεπλέομεν, καί τις θεὸς ἡγεμόνευεν νύκτα διʼ ὀρφναίην, οὐδὲ προυφαίνετʼ ἰδέσθαι· ἀὴρ γὰρ περὶ νηυσὶ βαθεῖʼ ἦν, οὐδὲ σελήνη
even as now Hephaestus, slow though he is, has out-stripped Ares for all that he is the swiftest of the gods who hold Olympus . Lame though he is, he has caught him by craft, wherefore Ares owes the fine of the adulterer.” Thus they spoke to one another. But to Hermes the lord Apollo, son of Zeus, said:	οὐρανόθεν προύφαινε, κατείχετο δὲ νεφέεσσιν. ἔνθʼ οὔ τις τὴν νῆσον ἐσέδρακεν ὀφθαλμοῖσιν, οὔτʼ οὖν κύματα μακρὰ κυλινδόμενα προτὶ χέρσον εἰσίδομεν, πρὶν νῆας ἐυσσέλμους ἐπικέλσαι. κελσάσῃσι δὲ νηυσὶ καθείλομεν ἱστία πάντα,
“Hermes, son of Zeus, messenger, giver of good things, wouldst thou in sooth be willing, even though ensnared with strong bonds, to lie on a couch by the side of golden Aphrodite?” Then the messenger, Argeiphontes, answered him:“Would that this might befall, lord Apollo, thou archer god—	ἐκ δὲ καὶ αὐτοὶ βῆμεν ἐπὶ ῥηγμῖνι θαλάσσης· ἔνθα δʼ ἀποβρίξαντες ἐμείναμεν Ἠῶ δῖαν. ἦμος δʼ ἠριγένεια φάνη ῥοδοδάκτυλος Ἠώς, νῆσον θαυμάζοντες ἐδινεόμεσθα κατʼ αὐτήν. ὦρσαν δὲ νύμφαι, κοῦραι Διὸς αἰγιόχοιο,
that thrice as many bonds inextricable might clasp me about and ye gods, aye, and all the goddesses too might be looking on, but that I might sleep by the side of golden Aphrodite.” So he spoke and laughter arose among the immortal gods. Yet Poseidon laughed not, but ever besought	αἶγας ὀρεσκῴους, ἵνα δειπνήσειαν ἑταῖροι. αὐτίκα καμπύλα τόξα καὶ αἰγανέας δολιχαύλους εἱλόμεθʼ ἐκ νηῶν, διὰ δὲ τρίχα κοσμηθέντες βάλλομεν· αἶψα δʼ ἔδωκε θεὸς μενοεικέα θήρην. νῆες μέν μοι ἕποντο δυώδεκα, ἐς δὲ ἑκάστην
Hephaestus, the famous craftsman, to set Ares free; and he spoke, and addressed him with winged words: “Loose him, and I promise, as thou biddest me, that he shall himself pay thee all that is right in the presence of the immortal gods.” Then the famous god of the two strong arms answered him:	ἐννέα λάγχανον αἶγες· ἐμοὶ δὲ δέκʼ ἔξελον οἴῳ. ὣς τότε μὲν πρόπαν ἦμαρ ἐς ἠέλιον καταδύντα ἥμεθα δαινύμενοι κρέα τʼ ἄσπετα καὶ μέθυ ἡδύ· οὐ γάρ πω νηῶν ἐξέφθιτο οἶνος ἐρυθρός, ἀλλʼ ἐνέην· πολλὸν γὰρ ἐν ἀμφιφορεῦσιν ἕκαστοι
“Ask not this of me, Poseidon, thou earth-enfolder. A sorry thing to be sure of is the surety for a sorry knave. How could I put thee in bonds among the immortal gods, if Ares should avoid both the debt and the bonds and depart?” Then again Poseidon, the earth-shaker, answered him:	ἠφύσαμεν Κικόνων. ἱερὸν πτολίεθρον ἑλόντες. Κυκλώπων δʼ ἐς γαῖαν ἐλεύσσομεν ἐγγὺς ἐόντων, καπνόν τʼ αὐτῶν τε φθογγὴν ὀίων τε καὶ αἰγῶν. ἦμος δʼ ἠέλιος κατέδυ καὶ ἐπὶ κνέφας ἦλθε, δὴ τότε κοιμήθημεν ἐπὶ ῥηγμῖνι θαλάσσης.
“Hephaestus, even if Ares shall avoid the debt and flee away, I will myself pay thee this.” Then the famous god of the two strong arms answered him: “It may not be that I should say thee nay, nor were it seemly.” So saying the mighty Hephaestus loosed the bonds	ἦμος δʼ ἠριγένεια φάνη ῥοδοδάκτυλος Ἠώς, καὶ τότʼ ἐγὼν ἀγορὴν θέμενος μετὰ πᾶσιν ἔειπον· ἄλλοι μὲν νῦν μίμνετʼ, ἐμοὶ ἐρίηρες ἑταῖροι· αὐτὰρ ἐγὼ σὺν νηί τʼ ἐμῇ καὶ ἐμοῖς ἑτάροισιν ἐλθὼν τῶνδʼ ἀνδρῶν πειρήσομαι, οἵ τινές εἰσιν,
and the two, when they were freed from that bond so strong, sprang up straightway. And Ares departed to Thrace , but she, the laughter-loving Aphrodite, went to Cyprus , to Paphos , where is her demesne and fragrant altar. There the Graces bathed her and anointed her with	ἤ ῥʼ οἵ γʼ ὑβρισταί τε καὶ ἄγριοι οὐδὲ δίκαιοι, ἦε φιλόξεινοι, καί σφιν νόος ἐστὶ θεουδής. ὣς εἰπὼν ἀνὰ νηὸς ἔβην, ἐκέλευσα δʼ ἑταίρους αὐτούς τʼ ἀμβαίνειν ἀνά τε πρυμνήσια λῦσαι. οἱ δʼ αἶψʼ εἴσβαινον καὶ ἐπὶ κληῖσι καθῖζον,
immortal oil, such as gleams upon the gods that are forever. And they clothed her in lovely raiment, a wonder to behold. This song the famous minstrel sang; and Odysseus was glad at heart as he listened, and so too were the Phaeacians of the long oars, men famed for their ships.	ἑξῆς δʼ ἑζόμενοι πολιὴν ἅλα τύπτον ἐρετμοῖς. ἀλλʼ ὅτε δὴ τὸν χῶρον ἀφικόμεθʼ ἐγγὺς ἐόντα, ἔνθα δʼ ἐπʼ ἐσχατιῇ σπέος εἴδομεν ἄγχι θαλάσσης, ὑψηλόν, δάφνῃσι κατηρεφές. ἔνθα δὲ πολλὰ μῆλʼ, ὄιές τε καὶ αἶγες, ἰαύεσκον· περὶ δʼ αὐλὴ
 Then Alcinous bade Halius and Laodamas dance alone, for no one could vie with them. And when they had taken in their hands the beautiful ball of purple, which wise Polybus had made for them, the one	ὑψηλὴ δέδμητο κατωρυχέεσσι λίθοισι μακρῇσίν τε πίτυσσιν ἰδὲ δρυσὶν ὑψικόμοισιν. ἔνθα δʼ ἀνὴρ ἐνίαυε πελώριος, ὅς ῥα τὰ μῆλα οἶος ποιμαίνεσκεν ἀπόπροθεν· οὐδὲ μετʼ ἄλλους πωλεῖτʼ, ἀλλʼ ἀπάνευθεν ἐὼν ἀθεμίστια ᾔδη.
 would lean backward and toss it toward the shadowy clouds, and the other would leap up from the earth and skilfully catch it before his feet touched the ground again. But when they had tried their skill in throwing the ball straight up, the two fell to dancing on the bounteous earth, ever tossing the ball to and fro, and the other youths	καὶ γὰρ θαῦμʼ ἐτέτυκτο πελώριον, οὐδὲ ἐῴκει ἀνδρί γε σιτοφάγῳ, ἀλλὰ ῥίῳ ὑλήεντι ὑψηλῶν ὀρέων, ὅ τε φαίνεται οἶον ἀπʼ ἄλλων. δὴ τότε τοὺς ἄλλους κελόμην ἐρίηρας ἑταίρους αὐτοῦ πὰρ νηί τε μένειν καὶ νῆα ἔρυσθαι,
stood in the lists and beat time, and thereat a great din arose. Then to Alcinous spoke goodly Odysseus: “Lord Alcinous, renowned above all men, thou didst boast that thy dancers were the best, and lo, thy words are made good; amazement holds me as I look on them.”	αὐτὰρ ἐγὼ κρίνας ἑτάρων δυοκαίδεκʼ ἀρίστους βῆν· ἀτὰρ αἴγεον ἀσκὸν ἔχον μέλανος οἴνοιο ἡδέος, ὅν μοι ἔδωκε Μάρων, Εὐάνθεος υἱός, ἱρεὺς Ἀπόλλωνος, ὃς Ἴσμαρον ἀμφιβεβήκει, οὕνεκά μιν σὺν παιδὶ περισχόμεθʼ ἠδὲ γυναικὶ
So he spoke, and the strong and mighty Alcinous was glad; and straightway he spoke among the Phaeacians, lovers of the oar: “Hear me, leaders and counsellors of the Phaeacians. This stranger verily seems to me a man of understanding. Come then, let us give him a gift of friendship, as is fitting;	ἁζόμενοι· ᾤκει γὰρ ἐν ἄλσεϊ δενδρήεντι Φοίβου Ἀπόλλωνος. ὁ δέ μοι πόρεν ἀγλαὰ δῶρα· χρυσοῦ μέν μοι ἔδωκʼ ἐυεργέος ἑπτὰ τάλαντα, δῶκε δέ μοι κρητῆρα πανάργυρον, αὐτὰρ ἔπειτα οἶνον ἐν ἀμφιφορεῦσι δυώδεκα πᾶσιν ἀφύσσας
 for twelve glorious kings bear sway in our land as rulers, and I myself am the thirteenth. Now do you, each of the twelve, bring a newly washed cloak and tunic, and a talent of precious gold, and let us straightway bring all together,	ἡδὺν ἀκηράσιον, θεῖον ποτόν· οὐδέ τις αὐτὸν ἠείδη δμώων οὐδʼ ἀμφιπόλων ἐνὶ οἴκῳ, ἀλλʼ αὐτὸς ἄλοχός τε φίλη ταμίη τε μίʼ οἴη. τὸν δʼ ὅτε πίνοιεν μελιηδέα οἶνον ἐρυθρόν, ἓν δέπας ἐμπλήσας ὕδατος ἀνὰ εἴκοσι μέτρα
that the stranger with our gifts in his hands may go to his supper glad at heart. And let Euryalus make amends to the stranger himself with words and with a gift, for the word that he spoke was in no wise seemly.” So he spoke, and they all praised his words and bade that so it should be, and sent forth every man a herald to fetch the gifts.	χεῦʼ, ὀδμὴ δʼ ἡδεῖα ἀπὸ κρητῆρος ὀδώδει θεσπεσίη· τότʼ ἂν οὔ τοι ἀποσχέσθαι φίλον ἦεν. τοῦ φέρον ἐμπλήσας ἀσκὸν μέγαν, ἐν δὲ καὶ ᾖα κωρύκῳ· αὐτίκα γάρ μοι ὀίσατο θυμὸς ἀγήνωρ ἄνδρʼ ἐπελεύσεσθαι μεγάλην ἐπιειμένον ἀλκήν,
And Euryalus in turn made answer, and said: “Lord Alcinous, renowned above all men, I will indeed make amends to the stranger, as thou biddest me. I will give him this sword, all of bronze, whereon is a hilt of silver, and a scabbard of new-sawn ivory	ἄγριον, οὔτε δίκας ἐὺ εἰδότα οὔτε θέμιστας. καρπαλίμως δʼ εἰς ἄντρον ἀφικόμεθʼ, οὐδέ μιν ἔνδον εὕρομεν, ἀλλʼ ἐνόμευε νομὸν κάτα πίονα μῆλα. ἐλθόντες δʼ εἰς ἄντρον ἐθηεύμεσθα ἕκαστα. ταρσοὶ μὲν τυρῶν βρῖθον, στείνοντο δὲ σηκοὶ
is wrought about it; and it shall be to him a thing of great worth.” So saying, he put into his hands the silver-studded sword, and spoke, and addressed him with winged words: “Hail, Sir stranger; but if any word has been spoken that was harsh, may the storm-winds straightway snatch it and bear it away.	ἀρνῶν ἠδʼ ἐρίφων· διακεκριμέναι δὲ ἕκασται ἔρχατο, χωρὶς μὲν πρόγονοι, χωρὶς δὲ μέτασσαι, χωρὶς δʼ αὖθʼ ἕρσαι. ναῖον δʼ ὀρῷ ἄγγεα πάντα, γαυλοί τε σκαφίδες τε, τετυγμένα, τοῖς ἐνάμελγεν. ἔνθʼ ἐμὲ μὲν πρώτισθʼ ἕταροι λίσσοντʼ ἐπέεσσιν
And for thyself, may the gods grant thee to see thy wife, and to come to thy native land, for long time hast thou been suffering woes far from thy friends.” And Odysseus of many wiles answered him: “All hail to thee, too, friend; and may the gods grant thee happiness, and mayest thou never hereafter miss	τυρῶν αἰνυμένους ἰέναι πάλιν, αὐτὰρ ἔπειτα καρπαλίμως ἐπὶ νῆα θοὴν ἐρίφους τε καὶ ἄρνας σηκῶν ἐξελάσαντας ἐπιπλεῖν ἁλμυρὸν ὕδωρ· ἀλλʼ ἐγὼ οὐ πιθόμην, ἦ τʼ ἂν πολὺ κέρδιον ἦεν, ὄφρʼ αὐτόν τε ἴδοιμι, καὶ εἴ μοι ξείνια δοίη.
this sword which thou hast given me, making amends with gentle speech.” He spoke, and about his shoulders hung the silver-studded sword. And the sun set, and the glorious gifts were brought him. These the lordly heralds bore to the palace of Alcinous, and the sons of peerless Alcinous	οὐδʼ ἄρʼ ἔμελλʼ ἑτάροισι φανεὶς ἐρατεινὸς ἔσεσθαι. ἔνθα δὲ πῦρ κήαντες ἐθύσαμεν ἠδὲ καὶ αὐτοὶ τυρῶν αἰνύμενοι φάγομεν, μένομέν τέ μιν ἔνδον ἥμενοι, ἧος ἐπῆλθε νέμων. φέρε δʼ ὄβριμον ἄχθος ὕλης ἀζαλέης, ἵνα οἱ ποτιδόρπιον εἴη,
took the beautiful gifts and set them before their honored mother. And the strong and mighty Alcinous led the way, and they came in and sat down on the high seats. Then to Arete spoke the mighty Alcinous: “Bring hither, wife, a goodly chest, the best thou hast,	ἔντοσθεν δʼ ἄντροιο βαλὼν ὀρυμαγδὸν ἔθηκεν· ἡμεῖς δὲ δείσαντες ἀπεσσύμεθʼ ἐς μυχὸν ἄντρου. αὐτὰρ ὅ γʼ εἰς εὐρὺ σπέος ἤλασε πίονα μῆλα πάντα μάλʼ ὅσσʼ ἤμελγε, τὰ δʼ ἄρσενα λεῖπε θύρηφιν, ἀρνειούς τε τράγους τε, βαθείης ἔκτοθεν αὐλῆς.
 and thyself place in it a newly-washed cloak and tunic; and do ye heat for the stranger a cauldron on the fire, and warm water, that when he has bathed and has seen well bestowed all the gifts which the noble Phaeacians have brought hither, he may take pleasure in the feast, and in hearing the strains of the song.	αὐτὰρ ἔπειτʼ ἐπέθηκε θυρεὸν μέγαν ὑψόσʼ ἀείρας, ὄβριμον· οὐκ ἂν τόν γε δύω καὶ εἴκοσʼ ἄμαξαι ἐσθλαὶ τετράκυκλοι ἀπʼ οὔδεος ὀχλίσσειαν· τόσσην ἠλίβατον πέτρην ἐπέθηκε θύρῃσιν. ἑζόμενος δʼ ἤμελγεν ὄις καὶ μηκάδας αἶγας,
And I will give him this beautiful cup of mine, wrought of gold, that he may remember me all his days as he pours libations in his halls to Zeus and to the other gods.” So he spoke, and Arete bade her handmaids to set a great cauldron on the fire with all speed.	πάντα κατὰ μοῖραν, καὶ ὑπʼ ἔμβρυον ἧκεν ἑκάστῃ. αὐτίκα δʼ ἥμισυ μὲν θρέψας λευκοῖο γάλακτος πλεκτοῖς ἐν ταλάροισιν ἀμησάμενος κατέθηκεν, ἥμισυ δʼ αὖτʼ ἔστησεν ἐν ἄγγεσιν, ὄφρα οἱ εἴη πίνειν αἰνυμένῳ καί οἱ ποτιδόρπιον εἴη.
 And they set on the blazing fire the cauldron for filling the bath, and poured in water, and took billets of wood and kindled them beneath it. Then the fire played about the belly of the cauldron, and the water grew warm; but meanwhile Arete brought forth for the stranger a beautiful chest from the treasure chamber, and placed in it the goodly gifts,	αὐτὰρ ἐπεὶ δὴ σπεῦσε πονησάμενος τὰ ἃ ἔργα, καὶ τότε πῦρ ἀνέκαιε καὶ εἴσιδεν, εἴρετο δʼ ἡμέας· ὦ ξεῖνοι, τίνες ἐστέ; πόθεν πλεῖθʼ ὑγρὰ κέλευθα; ἦ τι κατὰ πρῆξιν ἦ μαψιδίως ἀλάλησθε, οἷά τε ληιστῆρες, ὑπεὶρ ἅλα, τοί τʼ ἀλόωνται
the raiment and the gold, which the Phaeacians gave. And therein she herself placed a cloak and a fair tunic; and she spoke and addressed Odysseus with winged words: “Look now thyself to the lid, and quickly cast a cord upon it, lest some one despoil thee of thy goods on the way, when later on	ψυχὰς παρθέμενοι κακὸν ἀλλοδαποῖσι φέροντες; ὣς ἔφαθʼ, ἡμῖν δʼ αὖτε κατεκλάσθη φίλον ἦτορ, δεισάντων φθόγγον τε βαρὺν αὐτόν τε πέλωρον. ἀλλὰ καὶ ὥς μιν ἔπεσσιν ἀμειβόμενος προσέειπον· ἡμεῖς τοι Τροίηθεν ἀποπλαγχθέντες Ἀχαιοὶ
thou art lying in sweet sleep, as thou farest in the black ship.” Now when the much-enduring goodly Odysseus heard these words, he straightway fitted on the lid, and quickly cast a cord upon it—a cunning knot, which queenly Circe once had taught him. Then forthwith the housewife bade him	παντοίοις ἀνέμοισιν ὑπὲρ μέγα λαῖτμα θαλάσσης, οἴκαδε ἱέμενοι, ἄλλην ὁδὸν ἄλλα κέλευθα ἤλθομεν· οὕτω που Ζεὺς ἤθελε μητίσασθαι. λαοὶ δʼ Ἀτρεΐδεω Ἀγαμέμνονος εὐχόμεθʼ εἶναι, τοῦ δὴ νῦν γε μέγιστον ὑπουράνιον κλέος ἐστί·
go to the bath and bathe; and his heart was glad when he saw the warm bath, for he had not been wont to have such tendance from the time that he left the house of faired-haired Calypso, but until then he had tendance continually as a god. Now when the handmaids had bathed him and anointed him with oil,	τόσσην γὰρ διέπερσε πόλιν καὶ ἀπώλεσε λαοὺς πολλούς. ἡμεῖς δʼ αὖτε κιχανόμενοι τὰ σὰ γοῦνα ἱκόμεθʼ, εἴ τι πόροις ξεινήιον ἠὲ καὶ ἄλλως δοίης δωτίνην, ἥ τε ξείνων θέμις ἐστίν. ἀλλʼ αἰδεῖο, φέριστε, θεούς· ἱκέται δέ τοί εἰμεν,
 and had cast about him a fair cloak and a tunic, he came forth from the bath, and went to join the men at their wine. And Nausicaa, gifted with beauty by the gods, stood by the door-post of the well-built hall, and she marvelled at Odysseus, as her eyes beheld him,	Ζεὺς δʼ ἐπιτιμήτωρ ἱκετάων τε ξείνων τε, ξείνιος, ὃς ξείνοισιν ἅμʼ αἰδοίοισιν ὀπηδεῖ. ὣς ἐφάμην, ὁ δέ μʼ αὐτίκʼ ἀμείβετο νηλέι θυμῷ· νήπιός εἰς, ὦ ξεῖνʼ, ἢ τηλόθεν εἰλήλουθας, ὅς με θεοὺς κέλεαι ἢ δειδίμεν ἢ ἀλέασθαι·
and she spoke, and addressed him with winged words: “Farewell, stranger, and hereafter even in thy own native land mayest thou remember me, for to me first thou owest the price of thy life.” Then Odysseus of many wiles answered her:“Nausicaa, daughter of great-hearted Alcinous,	οὐ γὰρ Κύκλωπες Διὸς αἰγιόχου ἀλέγουσιν οὐδὲ θεῶν μακάρων, ἐπεὶ ἦ πολὺ φέρτεροί εἰμεν· οὐδʼ ἂν ἐγὼ Διὸς ἔχθος ἀλευάμενος πεφιδοίμην οὔτε σεῦ οὔθʼ ἑτάρων, εἰ μὴ θυμός με κελεύοι. ἀλλά μοι εἴφʼ ὅπῃ ἔσχες ἰὼν ἐυεργέα νῆα,
so may Zeus grant, the loud-thundering lord of Here, that I may reach my home and see the day of my returning. Then will I even there pray to thee as to a god all my days, for thou, maiden, hast given me life.” He spoke, and sat down on a chair beside king Alcinous.	ἤ που ἐπʼ ἐσχατιῆς, ἦ καὶ σχεδόν, ὄφρα δαείω. ὣς φάτο πειράζων, ἐμὲ δʼ οὐ λάθεν εἰδότα πολλά, ἀλλά μιν ἄψορρον προσέφην δολίοις ἐπέεσσι· νέα μέν μοι κατέαξε Ποσειδάων ἐνοσίχθων πρὸς πέτρῃσι βαλὼν ὑμῆς ἐπὶ πείρασι γαίης,
 And now they were serving out portions and mixing the wine. Then the herald came near, leading the good minstrel, Demodocus, held in honor by the people, and seated him in the midst of the banqueters, leaning his chair against a high pillar. Then to the herald said Odysseus of many wiles,	ἄκρῃ προσπελάσας· ἄνεμος δʼ ἐκ πόντου ἔνεικεν· αὐτὰρ ἐγὼ σὺν τοῖσδε ὑπέκφυγον αἰπὺν ὄλεθρον. ὣς ἐφάμην, ὁ δέ μʼ οὐδὲν ἀμείβετο νηλέι θυμῷ, ἀλλʼ ὅ γʼ ἀναΐξας ἑτάροις ἐπὶ χεῖρας ἴαλλε, σὺν δὲ δύω μάρψας ὥς τε σκύλακας ποτὶ γαίῃ
cutting off a portion of the chine of a white-tusked boar, whereof yet more was left, and there was rich fat on either side: “Herald, take and give this portion to Demodocus, that he may eat, and I will greet him, despite my grief. For among all men that are upon the earth minstrels	κόπτʼ· ἐκ δʼ ἐγκέφαλος χαμάδις ῥέε, δεῦε δὲ γαῖαν. τοὺς δὲ διὰ μελεϊστὶ ταμὼν ὡπλίσσατο δόρπον· ἤσθιε δʼ ὥς τε λέων ὀρεσίτροφος, οὐδʼ ἀπέλειπεν, ἔγκατά τε σάρκας τε καὶ ὀστέα μυελόεντα. ἡμεῖς δὲ κλαίοντες ἀνεσχέθομεν Διὶ χεῖρας,
win honor and reverence, for that the Muse has taught them the paths of song, and loves the tribe of minstrels.” So he spoke, and the herald bore the portion and placed it in the hands of the lord Demodocus, and he took it and was glad at heart. So they put forth their hands to the good cheer lying ready before them.	σχέτλια ἔργʼ ὁρόωντες, ἀμηχανίη δʼ ἔχε θυμόν. αὐτὰρ ἐπεὶ Κύκλωψ μεγάλην ἐμπλήσατο νηδὺν ἀνδρόμεα κρέʼ ἔδων καὶ ἐπʼ ἄκρητον γάλα πίνων, κεῖτʼ ἔντοσθʼ ἄντροιο τανυσσάμενος διὰ μήλων. τὸν μὲν ἐγὼ βούλευσα κατὰ μεγαλήτορα θυμὸν
But when they had put from them the desire of food and drink, then to Demodocus said Odysseus of many wiles: “Demodocus, verily above all mortal men do I praise thee, whether it was the Muse, the daughter of Zeus, that taught thee, or Apollo; for well and truly dost thou sing of the fate of the Achaeans,	ἆσσον ἰών, ξίφος ὀξὺ ἐρυσσάμενος παρὰ μηροῦ, οὐτάμεναι πρὸς στῆθος, ὅθι φρένες ἧπαρ ἔχουσι, χείρʼ ἐπιμασσάμενος· ἕτερος δέ με θυμὸς ἔρυκεν. αὐτοῦ γάρ κε καὶ ἄμμες ἀπωλόμεθʼ αἰπὺν ὄλεθρον· οὐ γάρ κεν δυνάμεσθα θυράων ὑψηλάων
 all that they wrought and suffered, and all the toils they endured, as though haply thou hadst thyself been present, or hadst heard the tale from another. But come now, change thy theme, and sing of the building of the horse of wood, which Epeius made with Athena's help, the horse which once Odysseus led up into the citadel as a thing of guile,	χερσὶν ἀπώσασθαι λίθον ὄβριμον, ὃν προσέθηκεν. ὣς τότε μὲν στενάχοντες ἐμείναμεν Ἠῶ δῖαν. ἦμος δʼ ἠριγένεια φάνη ῥοδοδάκτυλος Ἠώς, καὶ τότε πῦρ ἀνέκαιε καὶ ἤμελγε κλυτὰ μῆλα, πάντα κατὰ μοῖραν, καὶ ὑπʼ ἔμβρυον ἧκεν ἑκάστῃ.
when he had filled it with the men who sacked Ilios . If thou dost indeed tell me this tale aright, I will declare to all mankind that the god has of a ready heart granted thee the gift of divine song.” So he spoke, and the minstrel, moved by the god, began, and let his song be heard,	αὐτὰρ ἐπεὶ δὴ σπεῦσε πονησάμενος τὰ ἃ ἔργα, σὺν δʼ ὅ γε δὴ αὖτε δύω μάρψας ὡπλίσσατο δεῖπνον. δειπνήσας δʼ ἄντρου ἐξήλασε πίονα μῆλα, ῥηιδίως ἀφελὼν θυρεὸν μέγαν· αὐτὰρ ἔπειτα ἂψ ἐπέθηχʼ, ὡς εἴ τε φαρέτρῃ πῶμʼ ἐπιθείη.
 taking up the tale where the Argives had embarked on their benched ships and were sailing away, after casting fire on their huts, while those others led by glorious Odysseus were now sitting in the place of assembly of the Trojans, hidden in the horse; for the Trojans had themselves dragged it to the citadel.	πολλῇ δὲ ῥοίζῳ πρὸς ὄρος τρέπε πίονα μῆλα Κύκλωψ· αὐτὰρ ἐγὼ λιπόμην κακὰ βυσσοδομεύων, εἴ πως τισαίμην, δοίη δέ μοι εὖχος Ἀθήνη. ἥδε δέ μοι κατὰ θυμὸν ἀρίστη φαίνετο βουλή. Κύκλωπος γὰρ ἔκειτο μέγα ῥόπαλον παρὰ σηκῷ,
 So there it stood, while the people talked long as they sat about it, and could form no resolve. Nay, in three ways did counsel find favour in their minds: either to cleave the hollow timber with the pitiless bronze, or to drag it to the height and cast it down the rocks, or to let it stand as a great offering to propitiate the gods,	χλωρὸν ἐλαΐνεον· τὸ μὲν ἔκταμεν, ὄφρα φοροίη αὐανθέν. τὸ μὲν ἄμμες ἐίσκομεν εἰσορόωντες ὅσσον θʼ ἱστὸν νηὸς ἐεικοσόροιο μελαίνης, φορτίδος εὐρείης, ἥ τʼ ἐκπεράᾳ μέγα λαῖτμα· τόσσον ἔην μῆκος, τόσσον πάχος εἰσοράασθαι.
 even as in the end it was to be brought to pass; for it was their fate to perish when their city should enclose the great horse of wood, wherein were sitting all the best of the Argives, bearing to the Trojans death and fate. And he sang how the sons of the Achaeans	τοῦ μὲν ὅσον τʼ ὄργυιαν ἐγὼν ἀπέκοψα παραστὰς καὶ παρέθηχʼ ἑτάροισιν, ἀποξῦναι δʼ ἐκέλευσα· οἱ δʼ ὁμαλὸν ποίησαν· ἐγὼ δʼ ἐθόωσα παραστὰς ἄκρον, ἄφαρ δὲ λαβὼν ἐπυράκτεον ἐν πυρὶ κηλέῳ. καὶ τὸ μὲν εὖ κατέθηκα κατακρύψας ὑπὸ κόπρῳ,
 poured forth from the horse and, leaving their hollow ambush, sacked the city. Of the others he sang how in divers ways they wasted the lofty city, but of Odysseus, how he went like Ares to the house of Deiphobus together with godlike Menelaus. There it was, he said, that Odysseus braved the most terrible fight	ἥ ῥα κατὰ σπείους κέχυτο μεγάλʼ ἤλιθα πολλή· αὐτὰρ τοὺς ἄλλους κλήρῳ πεπαλάσθαι ἄνωγον, ὅς τις τολμήσειεν ἐμοὶ σὺν μοχλὸν ἀείρας τρῖψαι ἐν ὀφθαλμῷ, ὅτε τὸν γλυκὺς ὕπνος ἱκάνοι. οἱ δʼ ἔλαχον τοὺς ἄν κε καὶ ἤθελον αὐτὸς ἑλέσθαι,
and in the end conquered by the aid of great-hearted Athena. This song the famous minstrel sang. But the heart of Odysseus was melted and tears wet his cheeks beneath his eyelids. And as a woman wails and flings herself about her dear husband, who has fallen in front of his city and his people,	τέσσαρες, αὐτὰρ ἐγὼ πέμπτος μετὰ τοῖσιν ἐλέγμην. ἑσπέριος δʼ ἦλθεν καλλίτριχα μῆλα νομεύων. αὐτίκα δʼ εἰς εὐρὺ σπέος ἤλασε πίονα μῆλα πάντα μάλʼ, οὐδέ τι λεῖπε βαθείης ἔκτοθεν αὐλῆς, ἤ τι ὀισάμενος, ἢ καὶ θεὸς ὣς ἐκέλευσεν.
 seeking toward off from his city and his children the pitiless day; and as she beholds him dying and gasping for breath, she clings to him and shrieks aloud, while the foe behind her smite her back and shoulders with their spears, and lead her away to captivity to bear toil and woe,	αὐτὰρ ἔπειτʼ ἐπέθηκε θυρεὸν μέγαν ὑψόσʼ ἀείρας, ἑζόμενος δʼ ἤμελγεν ὄις καὶ μηκάδας αἶγας, πάντα κατὰ μοῖραν, καὶ ὑπʼ ἔμβρυον ἧκεν ἑκάστῃ. αὐτὰρ ἐπεὶ δὴ σπεῦσε πονησάμενος τὰ ἃ ἔργα, σὺν δʼ ὅ γε δὴ αὖτε δύω μάρψας ὡπλίσσατο δόρπον.
 while with most pitiful grief her cheeks are wasted: even so did Odysseus let fall pitiful tears from beneath his brows. Now from all the rest he concealed the tears that he shed, but Alcinous alone marked him and took heed,	καὶ τότʼ ἐγὼ Κύκλωπα προσηύδων ἄγχι παραστάς, κισσύβιον μετὰ χερσὶν ἔχων μέλανος οἴνοιο· Κύκλωψ, τῆ, πίε οἶνον, ἐπεὶ φάγες ἀνδρόμεα κρέα, ὄφρʼ εἰδῇς οἷόν τι ποτὸν τόδε νηῦς ἐκεκεύθει ἡμετέρη. σοὶ δʼ αὖ λοιβὴν φέρον, εἴ μʼ ἐλεήσας
for he sat by him and heard him groaning heavily. And straightway he spoke among the Phaeacians, lovers of the oar: “Hear me, leaders and counsellors of the Phaeacians, and let Demodocus now check his clear-toned lyre, for in no wise to all alike does he give pleasure with this song. Ever since we began to sup and the divine minstrel was moved to sing,	οἴκαδε πέμψειας· σὺ δὲ μαίνεαι οὐκέτʼ ἀνεκτῶς. σχέτλιε, πῶς κέν τίς σε καὶ ὕστερον ἄλλος ἵκοιτο ἀνθρώπων πολέων, ἐπεὶ οὐ κατὰ μοῖραν ἔρεξας; ὣς ἐφάμην, ὁ δʼ ἔδεκτο καὶ ἔκπιεν· ἥσατο δʼ αἰνῶς ἡδὺ ποτὸν πίνων καὶ μʼ ᾔτεε δεύτερον αὖτις·
 from that time yon stranger has never ceased from sorrowful lamentation; surely, methinks, grief has encompassed his heart. Nay, let the minstrel cease, that we may all make merry, hosts and guest alike, since it is better thus. Lo, for the sake of the honored stranger all these things have been made ready,	δός μοι ἔτι πρόφρων, καί μοι τεὸν οὔνομα εἰπὲ αὐτίκα νῦν, ἵνα τοι δῶ ξείνιον, ᾧ κε σὺ χαίρῃς· καὶ γὰρ Κυκλώπεσσι φέρει ζείδωρος ἄρουρα οἶνον ἐριστάφυλον, καί σφιν Διὸς ὄμβρος ἀέξει· ἀλλὰ τόδʼ ἀμβροσίης καὶ νέκταρός ἐστιν ἀπορρώξ.
 Tell me the name by which they were wont to call thee in thy home, even thy mother and thy father and other folk besides, thy townsmen and the dwellers round about. For there is no one of all mankind who is nameless, be he base man or noble, when once he has been born, but parents bestow names on all when they give them birth.	ὣς φάτʼ, ἀτάρ οἱ αὖτις ἐγὼ πόρον αἴθοπα οἶνον. τρὶς μὲν ἔδωκα φέρων, τρὶς δʼ ἔκπιεν ἀφραδίῃσιν. αὐτὰρ ἐπεὶ Κύκλωπα περὶ φρένας ἤλυθεν οἶνος, καὶ τότε δή μιν ἔπεσσι προσηύδων μειλιχίοισι· Κύκλωψ, εἰρωτᾷς μʼ ὄνομα κλυτόν, αὐτὰρ ἐγώ τοι
 And tell me thy country, thy people, and thy city, that our ships may convey thee thither, discerning the course by their wits. For the Phaeacians have no pilots, nor steering-oars such as other ships have, but their ships of themselves understand the thoughts and minds of men,	ἐξερέω· σὺ δέ μοι δὸς ξείνιον, ὥς περ ὑπέστης. Οὖτις ἐμοί γʼ ὄνομα· Οὖτιν δέ με κικλήσκουσι μήτηρ ἠδὲ πατὴρ ἠδʼ ἄλλοι πάντες ἑταῖροι. ὣς ἐφάμην, ὁ δέ μʼ αὐτίκʼ ἀμείβετο νηλέι θυμῷ· Οὖτιν ἐγὼ πύματον ἔδομαι μετὰ οἷς ἑτάροισιν,
 and they know the cities and rich fields of all peoples, and most swiftly do they cross over the gulf of the sea, hidden in mist and cloud, nor ever have they fear of harm or ruin. Yet this story I once heard thus told by my father	τοὺς δʼ ἄλλους πρόσθεν· τὸ δέ τοι ξεινήιον ἔσται. ἦ καὶ ἀνακλινθεὶς πέσεν ὕπτιος, αὐτὰρ ἔπειτα κεῖτʼ ἀποδοχμώσας παχὺν αὐχένα, κὰδ δέ μιν ὕπνος ᾕρει πανδαμάτωρ· φάρυγος δʼ ἐξέσσυτο οἶνος ψωμοί τʼ ἀνδρόμεοι· ὁ δʼ ἐρεύγετο οἰνοβαρείων.
Nausithous, who was wont to say that Poseidon was wroth with us because we give safe convoy to all men. He said that someday, as a well-built ship of the Phaeacians was returning from a convoy over the misty deep, Poseidon would smite her and would fling a great mountain about our city.	καὶ τότʼ ἐγὼ τὸν μοχλὸν ὑπὸ σποδοῦ ἤλασα πολλῆς, ἧος θερμαίνοιτο· ἔπεσσι δὲ πάντας ἑταίρους θάρσυνον, μή τίς μοι ὑποδείσας ἀναδύη. ἀλλʼ ὅτε δὴ τάχʼ ὁ μοχλὸς ἐλάινος ἐν πυρὶ μέλλεν ἅψεσθαι, χλωρός περ ἐών, διεφαίνετο δʼ αἰνῶς,
 So that old man spoke, and these things the god will haply bring to pass, or will leave unfulfilled, as may be his good pleasure. But come, now, tell me this and declare it truly: whither thou hast wandered and to what countries of men thou hast come; tell me of the people and of their well-built cities,	καὶ τότʼ ἐγὼν ἆσσον φέρον ἐκ πυρός, ἀμφὶ δʼ ἑταῖροι ἵσταντʼ· αὐτὰρ θάρσος ἐνέπνευσεν μέγα δαίμων. οἱ μὲν μοχλὸν ἑλόντες ἐλάινον, ὀξὺν ἐπʼ ἄκρῳ, ὀφθαλμῷ ἐνέρεισαν· ἐγὼ δʼ ἐφύπερθεν ἐρεισθεὶς δίνεον, ὡς ὅτε τις τρυπῷ δόρυ νήιον ἀνὴρ
both of those who are cruel and wild and unjust, and of those who love strangers and fear the gods in their thoughts. And tell me why thou dost weep and wail in spirit as thou hearest the doom of the Argive Danaans and of Ilios . This the gods wrought, and spun the skein of ruin	τρυπάνῳ, οἱ δέ τʼ ἔνερθεν ὑποσσείουσιν ἱμάντι ἁψάμενοι ἑκάτερθε, τὸ δὲ τρέχει ἐμμενὲς αἰεί. ὣς τοῦ ἐν ὀφθαλμῷ πυριήκεα μοχλὸν ἑλόντες δινέομεν, τὸν δʼ αἷμα περίρρεε θερμὸν ἐόντα. πάντα δέ οἱ βλέφαρʼ ἀμφὶ καὶ ὀφρύας εὗσεν ἀυτμὴ
for men, that there might be a song for those yet to be born. Did some kinsman of thine fall before Ilios , some good, true man, thy daughter's husband or thy wife's father, such as are nearest to one after one's own kin and blood? Or was it haply some comrade dear to thy heart,	γλήνης καιομένης, σφαραγεῦντο δέ οἱ πυρὶ ῥίζαι. ὡς δʼ ὅτʼ ἀνὴρ χαλκεὺς πέλεκυν μέγαν ἠὲ σκέπαρνον εἰν ὕδατι ψυχρῷ βάπτῃ μεγάλα ἰάχοντα φαρμάσσων· τὸ γὰρ αὖτε σιδήρου γε κράτος ἐστίν ὣς τοῦ σίζʼ ὀφθαλμὸς ἐλαϊνέῳ περὶ μοχλῷ.
 some good, true man? For no whit worse than a brother is a comrade who has an understanding heart.”	σμερδαλέον δὲ μέγʼ ᾤμωξεν, περὶ δʼ ἴαχε πέτρη, ἡμεῖς δὲ δείσαντες ἀπεσσύμεθʼ· αὐτὰρ ὁ μοχλὸν ἐξέρυσʼ ὀφθαλμοῖο πεφυρμένον αἵματι πολλῷ. τὸν μὲν ἔπειτʼ ἔρριψεν ἀπὸ ἕο χερσὶν ἀλύων, αὐτὰρ ὁ Κύκλωπας μεγάλʼ ἤπυεν, οἵ ῥά μιν ἀμφὶς
 Then Odysseus, of many wiles, answered him, and said: “Lord Alcinous, renowned above all men, verily this is a good thing, to listen to a minstrel such as this man is, like unto the gods in voice.	ἦ μή τίς σευ μῆλα βροτῶν ἀέκοντος ἐλαύνει; ἦ μή τίς σʼ αὐτὸν κτείνει δόλῳ ἠὲ βίηφιν; τοὺς δʼ αὖτʼ ἐξ ἄντρου προσέφη κρατερὸς Πολύφημος· ὦ φίλοι, Οὖτίς με κτείνει δόλῳ οὐδὲ βίηφιν. οἱ δʼ ἀπαμειβόμενοι ἔπεα πτερόεντʼ ἀγόρευον·
 For myself I declare that there is no greater fulfillment of delight than when joy possesses a whole people, and banqueters in the halls listen to a minstrel as they sit in order due, and by them tables are laden with bread and meat, and the cup-bearer draws wine from the bowl	εἰ μὲν δὴ μή τίς σε βιάζεται οἶον ἐόντα, νοῦσον γʼ οὔ πως ἔστι Διὸς μεγάλου ἀλέασθαι, ἀλλὰ σύ γʼ εὔχεο πατρὶ Ποσειδάωνι ἄνακτι. ὣς ἄρʼ ἔφαν ἀπιόντες, ἐμὸν δʼ ἐγέλασσε φίλον κῆρ, ὡς ὄνομʼ ἐξαπάτησεν ἐμὸν καὶ μῆτις ἀμύμων.
 and bears it round and pours it into the cups. This seems to my mind the fairest thing there is. But thy heart is turned to ask of my grievous woes, that I may weep and groan the more. What, then, shall I tell thee first, what last?	Κύκλωψ δὲ στενάχων τε καὶ ὠδίνων ὀδύνῃσι χερσὶ ψηλαφόων ἀπὸ μὲν λίθον εἷλε θυράων, αὐτὸς δʼ εἰνὶ θύρῃσι καθέζετο χεῖρε πετάσσας, εἴ τινά που μετʼ ὄεσσι λάβοι στείχοντα θύραζε· οὕτω γάρ πού μʼ ἤλπετʼ ἐνὶ φρεσὶ νήπιον εἶναι.
 for woes full many have the heavenly gods given me. First now will I tell my name, that ye, too, may know it, and that I hereafter, when I have escaped from the pitiless day of doom, may be your host, though I dwell in a home that is afar. I am Odysseus, son of Laertes, who	αὐτὰρ ἐγὼ βούλευον, ὅπως ὄχʼ ἄριστα γένοιτο, εἴ τινʼ ἑταίροισιν θανάτου λύσιν ἠδʼ ἐμοὶ αὐτῷ εὑροίμην· πάντας δὲ δόλους καὶ μῆτιν ὕφαινον ὥς τε περὶ ψυχῆς· μέγα γὰρ κακὸν ἐγγύθεν ἦεν. ἥδε δέ μοι κατὰ θυμὸν ἀρίστη φαίνετο βουλή.
am known among men for all manner of wiles, and my fame reaches unto heaven. But I dwell in clear-seen Ithaca , wherein is a mountain, Neriton, covered with waving forests, conspicuous from afar; and round it lie many isles hard by one another, Dulichium, and Same, and wooded Zacynthus .	ἄρσενες ὄιες ἦσαν ἐυτρεφέες, δασύμαλλοι, καλοί τε μεγάλοι τε, ἰοδνεφὲς εἶρος ἔχοντες· τοὺς ἀκέων συνέεργον ἐυστρεφέεσσι λύγοισιν, τῇς ἔπι Κύκλωψ εὗδε πέλωρ, ἀθεμίστια εἰδώς, σύντρεις αἰνύμενος· ὁ μὲν ἐν μέσῳ ἄνδρα φέρεσκε,
Ithaca itself lies close in to the mainland the furthest toward the gloom, but the others lie apart toward the Dawn and the sun—a rugged isle, but a good nurse of young men; and for myself no other thing can I see sweeter than one's own land. Of a truth Calypso, the beautiful goddess, sought to keep me by her	τὼ δʼ ἑτέρω ἑκάτερθεν ἴτην σώοντες ἑταίρους. τρεῖς δὲ ἕκαστον φῶτʼ ὄιες φέρον· αὐτὰρ ἐγώ γε— ἀρνειὸς γὰρ ἔην μήλων ὄχʼ ἄριστος ἁπάντων, τοῦ κατὰ νῶτα λαβών, λασίην ὑπὸ γαστέρʼ ἐλυσθεὶς κείμην· αὐτὰρ χερσὶν ἀώτου θεσπεσίοιο
 in her hollow caves, yearning that I should be her husband; and in like manner Circe would fain have held me back in her halls, the guileful lady of Aeaea, yearning that I should be her husband; but they could never persuade the heart within my breast. So true is it that naught is sweeter than a man's own land and his parents,	νωλεμέως στρεφθεὶς ἐχόμην τετληότι θυμῷ. ὣς τότε μὲν στενάχοντες ἐμείναμεν Ἠῶ δῖαν. ἦμος δʼ ἠριγένεια φάνη ῥοδοδάκτυλος Ἠώς, καὶ τότʼ ἔπειτα νομόνδʼ ἐξέσσυτο ἄρσενα μῆλα, θήλειαι δὲ μέμηκον ἀνήμελκτοι περὶ σηκούς·
even though it be in a rich house that he dwells afar in a foreign land away from his parents. But come, let me tell thee also of my woeful home-coming, which Zeus laid upon me as I came from Troy . “From Ilios the wind bore me and brought me to the Cicones,	οὔθατα γὰρ σφαραγεῦντο. ἄναξ δʼ ὀδύνῃσι κακῇσι τειρόμενος πάντων ὀίων ἐπεμαίετο νῶτα ὀρθῶν ἑσταότων· τὸ δὲ νήπιος οὐκ ἐνόησεν, ὥς οἱ ὑπʼ εἰροπόκων ὀίων στέρνοισι δέδεντο. ὕστατος ἀρνειὸς μήλων ἔστειχε θύραζε
 to Ismarus. There I sacked the city and slew the men; and from the city we took their wives and great store of treasure, and divided them among us, that so far as lay in me no man might go defrauded of an equal share. Then verily I gave command that we should flee with swift foot, but the others in their great folly did not hearken.	λάχνῳ στεινόμενος καὶ ἐμοὶ πυκινὰ φρονέοντι. τὸν δʼ ἐπιμασσάμενος προσέφη κρατερὸς Πολύφημος· κριὲ πέπον, τί μοι ὧδε διὰ σπέος ἔσσυο μήλων ὕστατος; οὔ τι πάρος γε λελειμμένος ἔρχεαι οἰῶν, ἀλλὰ πολὺ πρῶτος νέμεαι τέρενʼ ἄνθεα ποίης
But there much wine was drunk, and many sheep they slew by the shore, and sleek kine of shambling gait. Meanwhile the Cicones went and called to other Cicones who were their neighbors, at once more numerous and braver than they—men that dwelt inland and were skilled	μακρὰ βιβάς, πρῶτος δὲ ῥοὰς ποταμῶν ἀφικάνεις, πρῶτος δὲ σταθμόνδε λιλαίεαι ἀπονέεσθαι ἑσπέριος· νῦν αὖτε πανύστατος. ἦ σύ γʼ ἄνακτος ὀφθαλμὸν ποθέεις, τὸν ἀνὴρ κακὸς ἐξαλάωσε σὺν λυγροῖς ἑτάροισι δαμασσάμενος φρένας οἴνῳ,
 at fighting with their foes from chariots, and, if need were, on foot. So they came in the morning, as thick as leaves or flowers spring up in their season; and then it was that an evil fate from Zeus beset us luckless men, that we might suffer woes full many. They set their battle in array and fought by the swift ships,	Οὖτις, ὃν οὔ πώ φημι πεφυγμένον εἶναι ὄλεθρον. εἰ δὴ ὁμοφρονέοις ποτιφωνήεις τε γένοιο εἰπεῖν ὅππῃ κεῖνος ἐμὸν μένος ἠλασκάζει· τῷ κέ οἱ ἐγκέφαλός γε διὰ σπέος ἄλλυδις ἄλλῃ θεινομένου ῥαίοιτο πρὸς οὔδεϊ, κὰδ δέ κʼ ἐμὸν κῆρ
and each side hurled at the other with bronze-tipped spears. Now as long as it was morn and the sacred day was waxing, so long we held our ground and beat them off, though they were more than we. But when the sun turned to the time for the unyoking of oxen, then the Cicones prevailed and routed the Achaeans,	λωφήσειε κακῶν, τά μοι οὐτιδανὸς πόρεν Οὖτις. ὣς εἰπὼν τὸν κριὸν ἀπὸ ἕο πέμπε θύραζε. ἐλθόντες δʼ ἠβαιὸν ἀπὸ σπείους τε καὶ αὐλῆς πρῶτος ὑπʼ ἀρνειοῦ λυόμην, ὑπέλυσα δʼ ἑταίρους. καρπαλίμως δὲ τὰ μῆλα ταναύποδα, πίονα δημῷ,
and six of my well-greaved comrades perished from each ship; but the rest of us escaped death and fate. “Thence we sailed on, grieved at heart, glad to have escaped from death, though we had lost our dear comrades; nor did I let my curved ships pass on	πολλὰ περιτροπέοντες ἐλαύνομεν, ὄφρʼ ἐπὶ νῆα ἱκόμεθʼ. ἀσπάσιοι δὲ φίλοις ἑτάροισι φάνημεν, οἳ φύγομεν θάνατον, τοὺς δὲ στενάχοντο γοῶντες. ἀλλʼ ἐγὼ οὐκ εἴων, ἀνὰ δʼ ὀφρύσι νεῦον ἑκάστῳ, κλαίειν, ἀλλʼ ἐκέλευσα θοῶς καλλίτριχα μῆλα
 till we had called thrice on each of those hapless comrades of ours who died on the plain, cut down by the Cicones. But against our ships Zeus, the cloud-gatherer, roused the North Wind with a wondrous tempest, and hid with clouds the land and the sea alike, and night rushed down from heaven.	πόλλʼ ἐν νηὶ βαλόντας ἐπιπλεῖν ἁλμυρὸν ὕδωρ. οἱ δʼ αἶψʼ εἴσβαινον καὶ ἐπὶ κληῖσι καθῖζον, ἑξῆς δʼ ἑζόμενοι πολιὴν ἅλα τύπτον ἐρετμοῖς. ἀλλʼ ὅτε τόσσον ἀπῆν, ὅσσον τε γέγωνε βοήσας, καὶ τότʼ ἐγὼ Κύκλωπα προσηύδων κερτομίοισι·
 Then the ships were driven headlong, and their sails were torn to shreds by the violence of the wind. So we lowered the sails and stowed them aboard, in fear of death, and rowed the ships hurriedly toward the land. There for two nights and two days continuously	Κύκλωψ, οὐκ ἄρʼ ἔμελλες ἀνάλκιδος ἀνδρὸς ἑταίρους ἔδμεναι ἐν σπῆι γλαφυρῷ κρατερῆφι βίηφι. καὶ λίην σέ γʼ ἔμελλε κιχήσεσθαι κακὰ ἔργα, σχέτλιʼ, ἐπεὶ ξείνους οὐχ ἅζεο σῷ ἐνὶ οἴκῳ ἐσθέμεναι· τῷ σε Ζεὺς τίσατο καὶ θεοὶ ἄλλοι.
 we lay, eating our hearts for weariness and sorrow. But when now fair-tressed Dawn brought to its birth the third day, we set up the masts and hoisted the white sails, and took our seats, and the wind and the helmsmen steered the ships. And now all unscathed should I have reached my native land,	ὣς ἐφάμην, ὁ δʼ ἔπειτα χολώσατο κηρόθι μᾶλλον, ἧκε δʼ ἀπορρήξας κορυφὴν ὄρεος μεγάλοιο, κὰδ δʼ ἔβαλε προπάροιθε νεὸς κυανοπρῴροιο τυτθόν, ἐδεύησεν δʼ οἰήιον ἄκρον ἱκέσθαι, ἐκλύσθη δὲ θάλασσα κατερχομένης ὑπὸ πέτρης·
but the wave and the current and the North Wind beat me back as I was rounding Malea, and drove me from my course past Cythera . “Thence for nine days' space I was borne by direful winds over the teeming deep; but on the tenth we set foot on the land of the Lotus-eaters, who eat a flowery food.	τὴν δʼ αἶψʼ ἤπειρόνδε παλιρρόθιον φέρε κῦμα, πλημυρὶς ἐκ πόντοιο, θέμωσε δὲ χέρσον ἱκέσθαι. αὐτὰρ ἐγὼ χείρεσσι λαβὼν περιμήκεα κοντὸν ὦσα παρέξ, ἑτάροισι δʼ ἐποτρύνας ἐκέλευσα ἐμβαλέειν κώπῃς, ἵνʼ ὑπὲκ κακότητα φύγοιμεν,
 There we went on shore and drew water, and straightway my comrades took their meal by the swift ships. But when we had tasted food and drink, I sent forth some of my comrades to go and learn who the men were, who here ate bread upon the earth;	κρατὶ κατανεύων· οἱ δὲ προπεσόντες ἔρεσσον. ἀλλʼ ὅτε δὴ δὶς τόσσον ἅλα πρήσσοντες ἀπῆμεν, καὶ τότε δὴ Κύκλωπα προσηύδων· ἀμφὶ δʼ ἑταῖροι μειλιχίοις ἐπέεσσιν ἐρήτυον ἄλλοθεν ἄλλος· σχέτλιε, τίπτʼ ἐθέλεις ἐρεθιζέμεν ἄγριον ἄνδρα;
 two men I chose, sending with them a third as a herald. So they went straightway and mingled with the Lotus-eaters, and the Lotus-eaters did not plan death for my comrades, but gave them of the lotus to taste. And whosoever of them ate of the honey-sweet fruit of the lotus,	ὃς καὶ νῦν πόντονδε βαλὼν βέλος ἤγαγε νῆα αὖτις ἐς ἤπειρον, καὶ δὴ φάμεν αὐτόθʼ ὀλέσθαι. εἰ δὲ φθεγξαμένου τευ ἢ αὐδήσαντος ἄκουσε, σύν κεν ἄραξʼ ἡμέων κεφαλὰς καὶ νήια δοῦρα μαρμάρῳ ὀκριόεντι βαλών· τόσσον γὰρ ἵησιν.
and I bade the rest of my trusty comrades to embark with speed on the swift ships, lest perchance anyone should eat of the lotus and forget his homeward way. So they went on board straightway and sat down upon the benches, and sitting well in order smote the grey sea with their oars.	ὣς φάσαν, ἀλλʼ οὐ πεῖθον ἐμὸν μεγαλήτορα θυμόν, ἀλλά μιν ἄψορρον προσέφην κεκοτηότι θυμῷ· Κύκλωψ, αἴ κέν τίς σε καταθνητῶν ἀνθρώπων ὀφθαλμοῦ εἴρηται ἀεικελίην ἀλαωτύν, φάσθαι Ὀδυσσῆα πτολιπόρθιον ἐξαλαῶσαι,
 “Thence we sailed on, grieved at heart, and we came to the land of the Cyclopes, an overweening and lawless folk, who, trusting in the immortal gods, plant nothing with their hands nor plough; but all these things spring up for them without sowing or ploughing,	υἱὸν Λαέρτεω, Ἰθάκῃ ἔνι οἰκίʼ ἔχοντα. ὣς ἐφάμην, ὁ δέ μʼ οἰμώξας ἠμείβετο μύθῳ· ὢ πόποι, ἦ μάλα δή με παλαίφατα θέσφαθʼ ἱκάνει. ἔσκε τις ἐνθάδε μάντις ἀνὴρ ἠύς τε μέγας τε, Τήλεμος Εὐρυμίδης, ὃς μαντοσύνῃ ἐκέκαστο
 wheat, and barley, and vines, which bear the rich clusters of wine, and the rain of Zeus gives them increase. Neither assemblies for council have they, nor appointed laws, but they dwell on the peaks of lofty mountains in hollow caves, and each one is lawgiver	καὶ μαντευόμενος κατεγήρα Κυκλώπεσσιν· ὅς μοι ἔφη τάδε πάντα τελευτήσεσθαι ὀπίσσω, χειρῶν ἐξ Ὀδυσῆος ἁμαρτήσεσθαι ὀπωπῆς. ἀλλʼ αἰεί τινα φῶτα μέγαν καὶ καλὸν ἐδέγμην ἐνθάδʼ ἐλεύσεσθαι, μεγάλην ἐπιειμένον ἀλκήν·
to his children and his wives, and they reck nothing one of another. “Now there is a level isle that stretches aslant outside the harbor, neither close to the shore of the land of the Cyclopes, nor yet far off, a wooded isle. Therein live wild goats innumerable, for the tread of men scares them not away,	νῦν δέ μʼ ἐὼν ὀλίγος τε καὶ οὐτιδανὸς καὶ ἄκικυς ὀφθαλμοῦ ἀλάωσεν, ἐπεί μʼ ἐδαμάσσατο οἴνῳ. ἀλλʼ ἄγε δεῦρʼ, Ὀδυσεῦ, ἵνα τοι πὰρ ξείνια θείω πομπήν τʼ ὀτρύνω δόμεναι κλυτὸν ἐννοσίγαιον· τοῦ γὰρ ἐγὼ πάϊς εἰμί, πατὴρ δʼ ἐμὸς εὔχεται εἶναι.
 nor are hunters wont to come thither, men who endure toils in the woodland as they course over the peaks of the mountains. Neither with flocks is it held, nor with ploughed lands, but unsown and untilled all the days it knows naught of men, but feeds the bleating goats.	αὐτὸς δʼ, αἴ κʼ ἐθέλῃσʼ, ἰήσεται, οὐδέ τις ἄλλος οὔτε θεῶν μακάρων οὔτε θνητῶν ἀνθρώπων. ὣς ἔφατʼ, αὐτὰρ ἐγώ μιν ἀμειβόμενος προσέειπον· αἲ γὰρ δὴ ψυχῆς τε καὶ αἰῶνός σε δυναίμην εὖνιν ποιήσας πέμψαι δόμον Ἄϊδος εἴσω,
For the Cyclopes have at hand no ships with vermilion cheeks, nor are there ship-wrights in their land who might build them well-benched ships, which should perform all their wants, passing to the cities of other folk, as men often cross the sea in ships to visit one another—	ὡς οὐκ ὀφθαλμόν γʼ ἰήσεται οὐδʼ ἐνοσίχθων. ὣς ἐφάμην, ὁ δʼ ἔπειτα Ποσειδάωνι ἄνακτι εὔχετο χεῖρʼ ὀρέγων εἰς οὐρανὸν ἀστερόεντα· κλῦθι, Ποσείδαον γαιήοχε κυανοχαῖτα, εἰ ἐτεόν γε σός εἰμι, πατὴρ δʼ ἐμὸς εὔχεαι εἶναι,
 craftsmen, who would have made of this isle also a fair settlement. For the isle is nowise poor, but would bear all things in season. In it are meadows by the shores of the grey sea, well-watered meadows and soft, where vines would never fail, and in it level ploughland, whence	δὸς μὴ Ὀδυσσῆα πτολιπόρθιον οἴκαδʼ ἱκέσθαι υἱὸν Λαέρτεω, Ἰθάκῃ ἔνι οἰκίʼ ἔχοντα. ἀλλʼ εἴ οἱ μοῖρʼ ἐστὶ φίλους τʼ ἰδέειν καὶ ἱκέσθαι οἶκον ἐυκτίμενον καὶ ἑὴν ἐς πατρίδα γαῖαν, ὀψὲ κακῶς ἔλθοι, ὀλέσας ἄπο πάντας ἑταίρους,
 they might reap from season to season harvests exceeding deep, so rich is the soil beneath; and in it, too, is a harbor giving safe anchorage, where there is no need of moorings, either to throw out anchor-stones or to make fast stern cables, but one may beach one's ship and wait until the sailors' minds bid them put out, and the breezes blow fair.	νηὸς ἐπʼ ἀλλοτρίης, εὕροι δʼ ἐν πήματα οἴκῳ. ὣς ἔφατʼ εὐχόμενος, τοῦ δʼ ἔκλυε κυανοχαίτης. αὐτὰρ ὅ γʼ ἐξαῦτις πολὺ μείζονα λᾶαν ἀείρας ἧκʼ ἐπιδινήσας, ἐπέρεισε δὲ ἶνʼ ἀπέλεθρον, κὰδʼ δʼ ἔβαλεν μετόπισθε νεὸς κυανοπρῴροιο
 Now at the head of the harbor a spring of bright water flows forth from beneath a cave, and round about it poplars grow. Thither we sailed in, and some god guided us through the murky night; for there was no light to see, but a mist lay deep about the ships and the moon	τυτθόν, ἐδεύησεν δʼ οἰήιον ἄκρον ἱκέσθαι. ἐκλύσθη δὲ θάλασσα κατερχομένης ὑπὸ πέτρης· τὴν δὲ πρόσω φέρε κῦμα, θέμωσε δὲ χέρσον ἱκέσθαι. ἀλλʼ ὅτε δὴ τὴν νῆσον ἀφικόμεθʼ, ἔνθα περ ἄλλαι νῆες ἐύσσελμοι μένον ἁθρόαι, ἀμφὶ δʼ ἑταῖροι
 showed no light from heaven, but was shut in by clouds. Then no man's eyes beheld that island, nor did we see the long waves rolling on the beach, until we ran our well-benched ships on shore. And when we had beached the ships we lowered all the sails	ἥατʼ ὀδυρόμενοι, ἡμέας ποτιδέγμενοι αἰεί, νῆα μὲν ἔνθʼ ἐλθόντες ἐκέλσαμεν ἐν ψαμάθοισιν, ἐκ δὲ καὶ αὐτοὶ βῆμεν ἐπὶ ῥηγμῖνι θαλάσσης. μῆλα δὲ Κύκλωπος γλαφυρῆς ἐκ νηὸς ἑλόντες δασσάμεθʼ, ὡς μή τίς μοι ἀτεμβόμενος κίοι ἴσης.
and ourselves went forth on the shore of the sea, and there we fell asleep and waited for the bright Dawn. “As soon as early Dawn appeared, the rosy-fingered, we roamed throughout the isle marvelling at it; and the nymphs, the daughters of Zeus who bears the aegis, roused	ἀρνειὸν δʼ ἐμοὶ οἴῳ ἐυκνήμιδες ἑταῖροι μήλων δαιομένων δόσαν ἔξοχα· τὸν δʼ ἐπὶ θινὶ Ζηνὶ κελαινεφέι Κρονίδῃ, ὃς πᾶσιν ἀνάσσει, ῥέξας μηρίʼ ἔκαιον· ὁ δʼ οὐκ ἐμπάζετο ἱρῶν, ἀλλʼ ὅ γε μερμήριξεν ὅπως ἀπολοίατο πᾶσαι
 the mountain goats, that my comrades might have whereof to make their meal. Straightway we took from the ships our curved bows and long javelins, and arrayed in three bands we fell to smiting; and the god soon gave us game to satisfy our hearts. The ships that followed me were twelve, and to each	νῆες ἐύσσελμοι καὶ ἐμοὶ ἐρίηρες ἑταῖροι. ὣς τότε μὲν πρόπαν ἦμαρ ἐς ἠέλιον καταδύντα ἥμεθα δαινύμενοι κρέα τʼ ἄσπετα καὶ μέθυ ἡδύ· ἦμος δʼ ἠέλιος κατέδυ καὶ ἐπὶ κνέφας ἦλθε, δὴ τότε κοιμήθημεν ἐπὶ ῥηγμῖνι θαλάσσης.
nine goats fell by lot, but for me alone they chose out ten. “So then all day long till set of sun we sat feasting on abundant flesh and sweet wine. For not yet was the red wine spent from out our ships, but some was still left; for abundant store	ἦμος δʼ ἠριγένεια φάνη ῥοδοδάκτυλος Ἠώς, δὴ τότʼ ἐγὼν ἑτάροισιν ἐποτρύνας ἐκέλευσα αὐτούς τʼ ἀμβαίνειν ἀνά τε πρυμνήσια λῦσαι· οἱ δʼ αἶψʼ εἴσβαινον καὶ ἐπὶ κληῖσι καθῖζον, ἑξῆς δʼ ἑζόμενοι πολιὴν ἅλα τύπτον ἐρετμοῖς.
 had we drawn in jars for each crew when we took the sacred citadel of the Cicones. And we looked across to the land of the Cyclopes, who dwelt close at hand, and marked the smoke, and the voice of men, and of the sheep, and of the goats. But when the sun set and darkness came on, then we lay down to rest on the shore of the sea.	ἔνθεν δὲ προτέρω πλέομεν ἀκαχήμενοι ἦτορ, ἄσμενοι ἐκ θανάτοιο, φίλους ὀλέσαντες ἑταίρους.
whether they are cruel, and wild, and unjust, or whether they love strangers and fear the gods in their thoughts.’ “So saying, I went on board the ship and bade my comrades themselves to embark, and to loose the stern cables. So they went on board straightway and sat down upon the benches,	Αἰολίην δʼ ἐς νῆσον ἀφικόμεθʼ· ἔνθα δʼ ἔναιεν Αἴολος Ἱπποτάδης, φίλος ἀθανάτοισι θεοῖσιν, πλωτῇ ἐνὶ νήσῳ· πᾶσαν δέ τέ μιν πέρι τεῖχος χάλκεον ἄρρηκτον, λισσὴ δʼ ἀναδέδρομε πέτρη.
 and sitting well in order smote the grey sea with their oars. But when we had reached the place, which lay close at hand, there on the land's edge hard by the sea we saw a high cave, roofed over with laurels, and there many flocks, sheep and goats alike, were wont to sleep. Round about it	τοῦ καὶ δώδεκα παῖδες ἐνὶ μεγάροις γεγάασιν, ἓξ μὲν θυγατέρες, ἓξ δʼ υἱέες ἡβώοντες· ἔνθʼ ὅ γε θυγατέρας πόρεν υἱάσιν εἶναι ἀκοίτις. οἱ δʼ αἰεὶ παρὰ πατρὶ φίλῳ καὶ μητέρι κεδνῇ δαίνυνται, παρὰ δέ σφιν ὀνείατα μυρία κεῖται,
 a high court was built with stones set deep in the earth, and with tall pines and high-crested oaks. There a monstrous man was wont to sleep, who shepherded his flocks alone and afar, and mingled not with others, but lived apart, with his heart set on lawlessness.	κνισῆεν δέ τε δῶμα περιστεναχίζεται αὐλῇ ἤματα· νύκτας δʼ αὖτε παρʼ αἰδοίῃς ἀλόχοισιν εὕδουσʼ ἔν τε τάπησι καὶ ἐν τρητοῖσι λέχεσσι. καὶ μὲν τῶν ἱκόμεσθα πόλιν καὶ δώματα καλά. μῆνα δὲ πάντα φίλει με καὶ ἐξερέεινεν ἕκαστα,
For he was fashioned a wondrous monster, and was not like a man that lives by bread, but like a wooded peak of lofty mountains, which stands out to view alone, apart from the rest. “Then I bade the rest of my trusty comrades to remain there by the ship and to guard the ship,	Ἴλιον Ἀργείων τε νέας καὶ νόστον Ἀχαιῶν· καὶ μὲν ἐγὼ τῷ πάντα κατὰ μοῖραν κατέλεξα. ἀλλʼ ὅτε δὴ καὶ ἐγὼν ὁδὸν ᾔτεον ἠδʼ ἐκέλευον πεμπέμεν, οὐδέ τι κεῖνος ἀνήνατο, τεῦχε δὲ πομπήν. δῶκε δέ μʼ ἐκδείρας ἀσκὸν βοὸς ἐννεώροιο,
 but I chose twelve of the best of my comrades and went my way. With me I had a goat-skin of the dark, sweet wine, which Maro, son of Euanthes, had given me, the priest of Apollo, the god who used to watch over Ismarus. And he had given it me because we had protected him with his child and wife	ἔνθα δὲ βυκτάων ἀνέμων κατέδησε κέλευθα· κεῖνον γὰρ ταμίην ἀνέμων ποίησε Κρονίων, ἠμὲν παυέμεναι ἠδʼ ὀρνύμεν, ὅν κʼ ἐθέλῃσι. νηὶ δʼ ἐνὶ γλαφυρῇ κατέδει μέρμιθι φαεινῇ ἀργυρέῃ, ἵνα μή τι παραπνεύσῃ ὀλίγον περ·
 out of reverence; for he dwelt in a wooded grove of Phoebus Apollo. And he gave me splendid gifts: of well-wrought gold he gave me seven talents, and he gave me a mixing-bowl all of silver; and besides these, wine, wherewith he filled twelve jars in all,	αὐτὰρ ἐμοὶ πνοιὴν Ζεφύρου προέηκεν ἀῆναι, ὄφρα φέροι νῆάς τε καὶ αὐτούς· οὐδʼ ἄρʼ ἔμελλεν ἐκτελέειν· αὐτῶν γὰρ ἀπωλόμεθʼ ἀφραδίῃσιν. ἐννῆμαρ μὲν ὁμῶς πλέομεν νύκτας τε καὶ ἦμαρ, τῇ δεκάτῃ δʼ ἤδη ἀνεφαίνετο πατρὶς ἄρουρα,
 wine sweet and unmixed, a drink divine. Not one of his slaves nor of the maids in his halls knew thereof, but himself and his dear wife, and one house-dame only. And as often as they drank that honey-sweet red wine he would fill one cup and pour it into twenty measures of water,	καὶ δὴ πυρπολέοντας ἐλεύσσομεν ἐγγὺς ἐόντες· ἔνθʼ ἐμὲ μὲν γλυκὺς ὕπνος ἐπήλυθε κεκμηῶτα, αἰεὶ γὰρ πόδα νηὸς ἐνώμων, οὐδέ τῳ ἄλλῳ δῶχʼ ἑτάρων, ἵνα θᾶσσον ἱκοίμεθα πατρίδα γαῖαν· οἱ δʼ ἕταροι ἐπέεσσι πρὸς ἀλλήλους ἀγόρευον,
 and a smell would rise from the mixing-bowl marvellously sweet; then verily would one not choose to hold back. With this wine I filled and took with me a great skin, and also provision in a scrip; for my proud spirit had a foreboding that presently a man would come to me clothed in great might,	καί μʼ ἔφασαν χρυσόν τε καὶ ἄργυρον οἴκαδʼ ἄγεσθαι δῶρα παρʼ Αἰόλου μεγαλήτορος Ἱπποτάδαο. ὧδε δέ τις εἴπεσκεν ἰδὼν ἐς πλησίον ἄλλον· ὦ πόποι, ὡς ὅδε πᾶσι φίλος καὶ τίμιός ἐστιν ἀνθρώποις, ὅτεών τε πόλιν καὶ γαῖαν ἵκηται.
a savage man that knew naught of justice or of law. “Speedily we came to the cave, nor did we find him within, but he was pasturing his fat flocks in the fields. So we entered the cave and gazed in wonder at all things there. The crates were laden with cheeses, and the pens were crowded	πολλὰ μὲν ἐκ Τροίης ἄγεται κειμήλια καλὰ ληίδος, ἡμεῖς δʼ αὖτε ὁμὴν ὁδὸν ἐκτελέσαντες οἴκαδε νισσόμεθα κενεὰς σὺν χεῖρας ἔχοντες· καὶ νῦν οἱ τάδʼ ἔδωκε χαριζόμενος φιλότητι Αἴολος. ἀλλʼ ἄγε θᾶσσον ἰδώμεθα ὅττι τάδʼ ἐστίν,
 with lambs and kids. Each kind was penned separately: by themselves the firstlings, by themselves the later lambs, and by themselves again the newly weaned. And with whey were swimming all the well-wrought vessels, the milk-pails and the bowls into which he milked. Then my comrades spoke and besought me first of all	ὅσσος τις χρυσός τε καὶ ἄργυρος ἀσκῷ ἔνεστιν. ὣς ἔφασαν, βουλὴ δὲ κακὴ νίκησεν ἑταίρων· ἀσκὸν μὲν λῦσαν, ἄνεμοι δʼ ἐκ πάντες ὄρουσαν. τοὺς δʼ αἶψʼ ἁρπάξασα φέρεν πόντονδε θύελλα κλαίοντας, γαίης ἄπο πατρίδος. αὐτὰρ ἐγώ γε
 to take of the cheeses and depart, and thereafter speedily to drive to the swift ship the kids and lambs from out the pens, and to sail over the salt water. But I did not listen to them—verily it would have been better far—to the end that I might see the man himself, and whether he would give me gifts of entertainment.	ἐγρόμενος κατὰ θυμὸν ἀμύμονα μερμήριξα, ἠὲ πεσὼν ἐκ νηὸς ἀποφθίμην ἐνὶ πόντῳ, ἦ ἀκέων τλαίην καὶ ἔτι ζωοῖσι μετείην. ἀλλʼ ἔτλην καὶ ἔμεινα, καλυψάμενος δʼ ἐνὶ νηὶ κείμην. αἱ δʼ ἐφέροντο κακῇ ἀνέμοιο θυέλλῃ
Yet, as it fell, his appearing was not to prove a joy to my comrades. “Then we kindled a fire and offered sacrifice, and ourselves, too, took of the cheeses and ate, and thus we sat in the cave and waited for him until he came back, herding his flocks. He bore a mighty weight of dry wood to serve him at supper time,	αὖτις ἐπʼ Αἰολίην νῆσον, στενάχοντο δʼ ἑταῖροι. ἔνθα δʼ ἐπʼ ἠπείρου βῆμεν καὶ ἀφυσσάμεθʼ ὕδωρ, αἶψα δὲ δεῖπνον ἕλοντο θοῇς παρὰ νηυσὶν ἑταῖροι. αὐτὰρ ἐπεὶ σίτοιό τʼ ἐπασσάμεθʼ ἠδὲ ποτῆτος, δὴ τότʼ ἐγὼ κήρυκά τʼ ὀπασσάμενος καὶ ἑταῖρον
and flung it down with a crash inside the cave, but we, seized with terror, shrank back into a recess of the cave. But he drove his fat flocks into the wide cavern—all those that he milked; but the males—the rams and the goats—he left without in the deep court.	βῆν εἰς Αἰόλου κλυτὰ δώματα· τὸν δʼ ἐκίχανον δαινύμενον παρὰ ᾗ τʼ ἀλόχῳ καὶ οἷσι τέκεσσιν. ἐλθόντες δʼ ἐς δῶμα παρὰ σταθμοῖσιν ἐπʼ οὐδοῦ ἑζόμεθʼ· οἱ δʼ ἀνὰ θυμὸν ἐθάμβεον ἔκ τʼ ἐρέοντο· πῶς ἦλθες, Ὀδυσεῦ; τίς τοι κακὸς ἔχραε δαίμων;
 Then he lifted on high and set in place the great door-stone, a mighty rock; two and twenty stout four-wheeled wagons could not lift it from the ground, such a towering mass of rock he set in the doorway. Thereafter he sat down and milked the ewes and bleating goats	ἦ μέν σʼ ἐνδυκέως ἀπεπέμπομεν, ὄφρʼ ἀφίκοιο πατρίδα σὴν καὶ δῶμα καὶ εἴ πού τοι φίλον ἐστίν. ὣς φάσαν, αὐτὰρ ἐγὼ μετεφώνεον ἀχνύμενος κῆρ· ἄασάν μʼ ἕταροί τε κακοὶ πρὸς τοῖσί τε ὕπνος σχέτλιος. ἀλλʼ ἀκέσασθε, φίλοι· δύναμις γὰρ ἐν ὑμῖν.
 all in turn, and beneath each dam he placed her young. Then presently he curdled half the white milk, and gathered it in wicker baskets and laid it away, and the other half he set in vessels that he might have it to take and drink, and that it might serve him for supper.	ὣς ἐφάμην μαλακοῖσι καθαπτόμενος ἐπέεσσιν, οἱ δʼ ἄνεῳ ἐγένοντο· πατὴρ δʼ ἠμείβετο μύθῳ· ἔρρʼ ἐκ νήσου θᾶσσον, ἐλέγχιστε ζωόντων· οὐ γάρ μοι θέμις ἐστὶ κομιζέμεν οὐδʼ ἀποπέμπειν ἄνδρα τόν, ὅς κε θεοῖσιν ἀπέχθηται μακάρεσσιν·
But when he had busily performed his tasks, then he rekindled the fire, and caught sight of us, and asked: “‘Strangers, who are ye? Whence do ye sail over the watery ways? Is it on some business, or do ye wander at random over the sea, even as pirates, who wander,	ἔρρε, ἐπεὶ ἄρα θεοῖσιν ἀπεχθόμενος τόδʼ ἱκάνεις. ὣς εἰπὼν ἀπέπεμπε δόμων βαρέα στενάχοντα. ἔνθεν δὲ προτέρω πλέομεν ἀκαχήμενοι ἦτορ. τείρετο δʼ ἀνδρῶν θυμὸς ὑπʼ εἰρεσίης ἀλεγεινῆς ἡμετέρῃ ματίῃ, ἐπεὶ οὐκέτι φαίνετο πομπή.
hazarding their lives and bringing evil to men of other lands?’ “So he spoke, and in our breasts our spirit was broken for terror of his deep voice and monstrous self; yet even so I made answer and spoke to him, saying: “‘We, thou must know, are from Troy , Achaeans, driven wandering	ἑξῆμαρ μὲν ὁμῶς πλέομεν νύκτας τε καὶ ἦμαρ, ἑβδομάτῃ δʼ ἱκόμεσθα Λάμου αἰπὺ πτολίεθρον, Τηλέπυλον Λαιστρυγονίην, ὅθι ποιμένα ποιμὴν ἠπύει εἰσελάων, ὁ δέ τʼ ἐξελάων ὑπακούει. ἔνθα κʼ ἄυπνος ἀνὴρ δοιοὺς ἐξήρατο μισθούς,
 by all manner of winds over the great gulf of the sea. Seeking our home, we have come by another way, by other paths; so, I ween, Zeus was pleased to devise. And we declare that we are the men of Agamemnon, son of Atreus, whose fame is now mightiest under heaven,	τὸν μὲν βουκολέων, τὸν δʼ ἄργυφα μῆλα νομεύων· ἐγγὺς γὰρ νυκτός τε καὶ ἤματός εἰσι κέλευθοι. ἔνθʼ ἐπεὶ ἐς λιμένα κλυτὸν ἤλθομεν, ὃν πέρι πέτρη ἠλίβατος τετύχηκε διαμπερὲς ἀμφοτέρωθεν, ἀκταὶ δὲ προβλῆτες ἐναντίαι ἀλλήλῃσιν
 so great a city did he sack, and slew many people; but we on our part, thus visiting thee, have come as suppliants to thy knees, in the hope that thou wilt give us entertainment, or in other wise make some present, as is the due of strangers. Nay, mightiest one, reverence the gods; we are thy suppliants;	ἐν στόματι προύχουσιν, ἀραιὴ δʼ εἴσοδός ἐστιν, ἔνθʼ οἵ γʼ εἴσω πάντες ἔχον νέας ἀμφιελίσσας. αἱ μὲν ἄρʼ ἔντοσθεν λιμένος κοίλοιο δέδεντο πλησίαι· οὐ μὲν γάρ ποτʼ ἀέξετο κῦμά γʼ ἐν αὐτῷ, οὔτε μέγʼ οὔτʼ ὀλίγον, λευκὴ δʼ ἦν ἀμφὶ γαλήνη·
and Zeus is the avenger of suppliants and strangers—Zeus, the strangers' god—who ever attends upon reverend strangers.’ “So I spoke, and he straightway made answer with pitiless heart: ‘A fool art thou, stranger, or art come from afar, seeing that thou biddest me either to fear or to shun the gods.	αὐτὰρ ἐγὼν οἶος σχέθον ἔξω νῆα μέλαιναν, αὐτοῦ ἐπʼ ἐσχατιῇ, πέτρης ἐκ πείσματα δήσας· ἔστην δὲ σκοπιὴν ἐς παιπαλόεσσαν ἀνελθών. ἔνθα μὲν οὔτε βοῶν οὔτʼ ἀνδρῶν φαίνετο ἔργα, καπνὸν δʼ οἶον ὁρῶμεν ἀπὸ χθονὸς ἀίσσοντα.
 For the Cyclopes reck not of Zeus, who bears the aegis, nor of the blessed gods, since verily we are better far than they. Nor would I, to shun the wrath of Zeus, spare either thee or thy comrades, unless my own heart should bid me. But tell me where thou didst moor thy well-wrought ship on thy coming.	δὴ τότʼ ἐγὼν ἑτάρους προΐειν πεύθεσθαι ἰόντας, οἵ τινες ἀνέρες εἶεν ἐπὶ χθονὶ σῖτον ἔδοντες, ἄνδρε δύω κρίνας, τρίτατον κήρυχʼ ἅμʼ ὀπάσσας. οἱ δʼ ἴσαν ἐκβάντες λείην ὁδόν, ᾗ περ ἄμαξαι ἄστυδʼ ἀφʼ ὑψηλῶν ὀρέων καταγίνεον ὕλην,
Was it haply at a remote part of the land, or close by? I fain would know.’ “So he spoke, tempting me, but he trapped me not because of my great cunning; and I made answer again in crafty words: “‘My ship Poseidon, the earth-shaker, dashed to pieces, casting her upon the rocks at the border of your land;	κούρῃ δὲ ξύμβληντο πρὸ ἄστεος ὑδρευούσῃ, θυγατέρʼ ἰφθίμῃ Λαιστρυγόνος Ἀντιφάταο. ἡ μὲν ἄρʼ ἐς κρήνην κατεβήσετο καλλιρέεθρον Ἀρτακίην· ἔνθεν γὰρ ὕδωρ προτὶ ἄστυ φέρεσκον· οἱ δὲ παριστάμενοι προσεφώνεον ἔκ τʼ ἐρέοντο
for he brought her close to the headland, and the wind drove her in from the sea. But I, with these men here, escaped utter destruction.’ “So I spoke, but from his pitiless heart he made no answer, but sprang up and put forth his hands upon my comrades. Two of them at once he seized and dashed to the earth like puppies,	ὅς τις τῶνδʼ εἴη βασιλεὺς καὶ οἷσιν ἀνάσσοι· ἡ δὲ μάλʼ αὐτίκα πατρὸς ἐπέφραδεν ὑψερεφὲς δῶ. οἱ δʼ ἐπεὶ εἰσῆλθον κλυτὰ δώματα, τὴν δὲ γυναῖκα εὗρον, ὅσην τʼ ὄρεος κορυφήν, κατὰ δʼ ἔστυγον αὐτήν. ἡ δʼ αἶψʼ ἐξ ἀγορῆς ἐκάλει κλυτὸν Ἀντιφατῆα,
 and the brain flowed forth upon the ground and wetted the earth. Then he cut them limb from limb and made ready his supper, and ate them as a mountain-nurtured lion, leaving naught—ate the entrails, and the flesh, and the marrowy bones. And we with wailing held up our hands to Zeus,	ὃν πόσιν, ὃς δὴ τοῖσιν ἐμήσατο λυγρὸν ὄλεθρον. αὐτίχʼ ἕνα μάρψας ἑτάρων ὡπλίσσατο δεῖπνον· τὼ δὲ δύʼ ἀίξαντε φυγῇ ἐπὶ νῆας ἱκέσθην. αὐτὰρ ὁ τεῦχε βοὴν διὰ ἄστεος· οἱ δʼ ἀίοντες φοίτων ἴφθιμοι Λαιστρυγόνες ἄλλοθεν ἄλλος,
beholding his cruel deeds; and helplessness possessed our souls. But when the Cyclops had filled his huge maw by eating human flesh and thereafter drinking pure milk, he lay down within the cave, stretched out among the sheep. And I formed a plan in my great heart	μυρίοι, οὐκ ἄνδρεσσιν ἐοικότες, ἀλλὰ Γίγασιν. οἵ ῥʼ ἀπὸ πετράων ἀνδραχθέσι χερμαδίοισιν βάλλον· ἄφαρ δὲ κακὸς κόναβος κατὰ νῆας ὀρώρει ἀνδρῶν τʼ ὀλλυμένων νηῶν θʼ ἅμα ἀγνυμενάων· ἰχθῦς δʼ ὣς πείροντες ἀτερπέα δαῖτα φέροντο.
 to steal near him, and draw my sharp sword from beside my thigh and smite him in the breast, where the midriff holds the liver, feeling for the place with my hand. But a second thought checked me, for right there should we, too, have perished in utter ruin. For we should not have been able	ὄφρʼ οἱ τοὺς ὄλεκον λιμένος πολυβενθέος ἐντός, τόφρα δʼ ἐγὼ ξίφος ὀξὺ ἐρυσσάμενος παρὰ μηροῦ τῷ ἀπὸ πείσματʼ ἔκοψα νεὸς κυανοπρῴροιο. αἶψα δʼ ἐμοῖς ἑτάροισιν ἐποτρύνας ἐκέλευσα ἐμβαλέειν κώπῃς, ἵνʼ ὑπὲκ κακότητα φύγοιμεν·
to thrust back with our hands from the high door the mighty stone which he had set there. So then, with wailing, we waited for the bright Dawn. “As soon as early Dawn appeared, the rosy-fingered, he rekindled the fire and milked his goodly flocks all in turn, and beneath each dam placed her young.	οἱ δʼ ἅλα πάντες ἀνέρριψαν, δείσαντες ὄλεθρον. ἀσπασίως δʼ ἐς πόντον ἐπηρεφέας φύγε πέτρας νηῦς ἐμή· αὐτὰρ αἱ ἄλλαι ἀολλέες αὐτόθʼ ὄλοντο. ἔνθεν δὲ προτέρω πλέομεν ἀκαχήμενοι ἦτορ, ἄσμενοι ἐκ θανάτοιο, φίλους ὀλέσαντες ἑταίρους.
 Then, when he had busily performed his tasks, again he seized two men at once and made ready his meal. And when he had made his meal he drove his fat flocks forth from the cave, easily moving away the great door-stone; and then he put it in place again, as one might set the lid upon a quiver.	Αἰαίην δʼ ἐς νῆσον ἀφικόμεθʼ· ἔνθα δʼ ἔναιε Κίρκη ἐυπλόκαμος, δεινὴ θεὸς αὐδήεσσα, αὐτοκασιγνήτη ὀλοόφρονος Αἰήταο· ἄμφω δʼ ἐκγεγάτην φαεσιμβρότου Ἠελίοιο μητρός τʼ ἐκ Πέρσης, τὴν Ὠκεανὸς τέκε παῖδα.
Then with loud whistling the Cyclops turned his fat flocks toward the mountain, and I was left there, devising evil in the deep of my heart, if in any way I might take vengeance on him, and Athena grant me glory. “Now this seemed to my mind the best plan. There lay beside a sheep-pen a great club of the Cyclops ,	ἔνθα δʼ ἐπʼ ἀκτῆς νηὶ κατηγαγόμεσθα σιωπῇ ναύλοχον ἐς λιμένα, καί τις θεὸς ἡγεμόνευεν. ἔνθα τότʼ ἐκβάντες δύο τʼ ἤματα καὶ δύο νύκτας κείμεθʼ ὁμοῦ καμάτῳ τε καὶ ἄλγεσι θυμὸν ἔδοντες. ἀλλʼ ὅτε δὴ τρίτον ἦμαρ ἐυπλόκαμος τέλεσʼ Ἠώς,
 a staff of green olive-wood, which he had cut to carry with him when dry; and as we looked at it we thought it as large as is the mast of a black ship of twenty oars, a merchantman, broad of beam, which crosses over the great gulf; so huge it was in length and in breadth to look upon.	καὶ τότʼ ἐγὼν ἐμὸν ἔγχος ἑλὼν καὶ φάσγανον ὀξὺ καρπαλίμως παρὰ νηὸς ἀνήιον ἐς περιωπήν, εἴ πως ἔργα ἴδοιμι βροτῶν ἐνοπήν τε πυθοίμην. ἔστην δὲ σκοπιὴν ἐς παιπαλόεσσαν ἀνελθών, καί μοι ἐείσατο καπνὸς ἀπὸ χθονὸς εὐρυοδείης,
 To this I came, and cut off therefrom about a fathom's length and handed it to my comrades, bidding them dress it down; and they made it smooth, and I, standing by, sharpened it at the point, and then straightway took it and hardened it in the blazing fire. Then I laid it carefully away, hiding it beneath the dung,	Κίρκης ἐν μεγάροισι, διὰ δρυμὰ πυκνὰ καὶ ὕλην. μερμήριξα δʼ ἔπειτα κατὰ φρένα καὶ κατὰ θυμὸν ἐλθεῖν ἠδὲ πυθέσθαι, ἐπεὶ ἴδον αἴθοπα καπνόν. ὧδε δέ μοι φρονέοντι δοάσσατο κέρδιον εἶναι, πρῶτʼ ἐλθόντʼ ἐπὶ νῆα θοὴν καὶ θῖνα θαλάσσης
 which lay in great heaps throughout the cave. And I bade my comrades cast lots among them, which of them should have the hardihood with me to lift the stake and grind it into his eye when sweet sleep should come upon him. And the lot fell upon those whom I myself would fain have chosen;	δεῖπνον ἑταίροισιν δόμεναι προέμεν τε πυθέσθαι. ἀλλʼ ὅτε δὴ σχεδὸν ἦα κιὼν νεὸς ἀμφιελίσσης, καὶ τότε τίς με θεῶν ὀλοφύρατο μοῦνον ἐόντα, ὅς ῥά μοι ὑψίκερων ἔλαφον μέγαν εἰς ὁδὸν αὐτὴν ἧκεν. ὁ μὲν ποταμόνδε κατήιεν ἐκ νομοῦ ὕλης
 four they were, and I was numbered with them as the fifth. At even then he came, herding his flocks of goodly fleece, and straightway drove into the wide cave his fat flocks one and all, and left not one without in the deep court, either from some foreboding or because a god so bade him.	πιόμενος· δὴ γάρ μιν ἔχεν μένος ἠελίοιο. τὸν δʼ ἐγὼ ἐκβαίνοντα κατʼ ἄκνηστιν μέσα νῶτα πλῆξα· τὸ δʼ ἀντικρὺ δόρυ χάλκεον ἐξεπέρησε, κὰδ δʼ ἔπεσʼ ἐν κονίῃσι μακών, ἀπὸ δʼ ἔπτατο θυμός. τῷ δʼ ἐγὼ ἐμβαίνων δόρυ χάλκεον ἐξ ὠτειλῆς
 Then he lifted on high and set in place the great door-stone, and sitting down he milked the ewes and bleating goats all in turn, and beneath each dam he placed her young. But when he had busily performed his tasks, again he seized two men at once and made ready his supper.	εἰρυσάμην· τὸ μὲν αὖθι κατακλίνας ἐπὶ γαίῃ εἴασʼ· αὐτὰρ ἐγὼ σπασάμην ῥῶπάς τε λύγους τε, πεῖσμα δʼ, ὅσον τʼ ὄργυιαν, ἐυστρεφὲς ἀμφοτέρωθεν πλεξάμενος συνέδησα πόδας δεινοῖο πελώρου, βῆν δὲ καταλοφάδεια φέρων ἐπὶ νῆα μέλαιναν
Then I drew near and spoke to the Cyclops , holding in my hands an ivy bowl of the dark wine: “‘ Cyclops , take and drink wine after thy meal of human flesh, that thou mayest know what manner of drink this is which our ship contained. It was to thee that I was bringing it as a drink offering, in the hope that, touched with pity,	ἔγχει ἐρειδόμενος, ἐπεὶ οὔ πως ἦεν ἐπʼ ὤμου χειρὶ φέρειν ἑτέρῃ· μάλα γὰρ μέγα θηρίον ἦεν. κὰδʼ δʼ ἔβαλον προπάροιθε νεός, ἀνέγειρα δʼ ἑταίρους μειλιχίοις ἐπέεσσι παρασταδὸν ἄνδρα ἕκαστον· ὦ φίλοι, οὐ γάρ πω καταδυσόμεθʼ ἀχνύμενοί περ
thou mightest send me on my way home; but thou ragest in a way that is past all bearing. Cruel man, how shall any one of all the multitudes of men ever come to thee again hereafter, seeing that thou hast wrought lawlessness?’ “So I spoke, and he took the cup and drained it, and was wondrously pleased as he drank the sweet draught, and asked me for it again a second time:	εἰς Ἀίδαο δόμους, πρὶν μόρσιμον ἦμαρ ἐπέλθῃ· ἀλλʼ ἄγετʼ, ὄφρʼ ἐν νηὶ θοῇ βρῶσίς τε πόσις τε, μνησόμεθα βρώμης, μηδὲ τρυχώμεθα λιμῷ. ὣς ἐφάμην, οἱ δʼ ὦκα ἐμοῖς ἐπέεσσι πίθοντο, ἐκ δὲ καλυψάμενοι παρὰ θῖνʼ ἁλὸς ἀτρυγέτοιο
“‘Give it me again with a ready heart, and tell me thy name straightway, that I may give thee a stranger's gift whereat thou mayest be glad. For among the Cyclopes the earth, the giver of grain, bears the rich clusters of wine, and the rain of Zeus gives them increase; but this is a streamlet of ambrosia and nectar.’	θηήσαντʼ ἔλαφον· μάλα γὰρ μέγα θηρίον ἦεν. αὐτὰρ ἐπεὶ τάρπησαν ὁρώμενοι ὀφθαλμοῖσιν, χεῖρας νιψάμενοι τεύχοντʼ ἐρικυδέα δαῖτα. ὣς τότε μὲν πρόπαν ἦμαρ ἐς ἠέλιον καταδύντα ἥμεθα δαινύμενοι κρέα τʼ ἄσπετα καὶ μέθυ ἡδύ·
“So he spoke, and again I handed him the flaming wine. Thrice I brought and gave it him, and thrice he drained it in his folly. But when the wine had stolen about the wits of the Cyclops , then I spoke to him with gentle words: “‘ Cyclops , thou askest me of my glorious name, and I	ἦμος δʼ ἠέλιος κατέδυ καὶ ἐπὶ κνέφας ἦλθε, δὴ τότε κοιμήθημεν ἐπὶ ῥηγμῖνι θαλάσσης. ἦμος δʼ ἠριγένεια φάνη ῥοδοδάκτυλος Ἠώς, καὶ τότʼ ἐγὼν ἀγορὴν θέμενος μετὰ πᾶσιν ἔειπον· κέκλυτέ μευ μύθων, κακά περ πάσχοντες ἑταῖροι·
will tell it thee; and do thou give me a stranger's gift, even as thou didst promise. Noman is my name, Noman do they call me—my mother and my father, and all my comrades as well.’ “So I spoke, and he straightway answered me with pitiless heart: ‘Noman will I eat last among his comrades,	ὦ φίλοι, οὐ γάρ τʼ ἴδμεν, ὅπῃ ζόφος οὐδʼ ὅπῃ ἠώς, οὐδʼ ὅπῃ ἠέλιος φαεσίμβροτος εἶσʼ ὑπὸ γαῖαν, οὐδʼ ὅπῃ ἀννεῖται· ἀλλὰ φραζώμεθα θᾶσσον εἴ τις ἔτʼ ἔσται μῆτις. ἐγὼ δʼ οὔκ οἴομαι εἶναι. εἶδον γὰρ σκοπιὴν ἐς παιπαλόεσσαν ἀνελθὼν
and the others before him; this shall be thy gift.’ “He spoke, and reeling fell upon his back, and lay there with his thick neck bent aslant, and sleep, that conquers all, laid hold on him. And from his gullet came forth wine and bits of human flesh, and he vomited in his drunken sleep.	νῆσον, τὴν πέρι πόντος ἀπείριτος ἐστεφάνωται· αὐτὴ δὲ χθαμαλὴ κεῖται· καπνὸν δʼ ἐνὶ μέσσῃ ἔδρακον ὀφθαλμοῖσι διὰ δρυμὰ πυκνὰ καὶ ὕλην. ὣς ἐφάμην, τοῖσιν δὲ κατεκλάσθη φίλον ἦτορ μνησαμένοις ἔργων Λαιστρυγόνος Ἀντιφάταο
 Then verily I thrust in the stake under the deep ashes until it should grow hot, and heartened all my comrades with cheering words, that I might see no man flinch through fear. But when presently that stake of olive-wood was about to catch fire, green though it was, and began to glow terribly,	Κύκλωπός τε βίης μεγαλήτορος, ἀνδροφάγοιο. κλαῖον δὲ λιγέως θαλερὸν κατὰ δάκρυ χέοντες· ἀλλʼ οὐ γάρ τις πρῆξις ἐγίγνετο μυρομένοισιν. αὐτὰρ ἐγὼ δίχα πάντας ἐυκνήμιδας ἑταίρους ἠρίθμεον, ἀρχὸν δὲ μετʼ ἀμφοτέροισιν ὄπασσα·
 then verily I drew nigh, bringing the stake from the fire, and my comrades stood round me and a god breathed into us great courage. They took the stake of olive-wood, sharp at the point, and thrust it into his eye, while I, throwing my weight upon it from above, whirled it round, as when a man bores a ship's timber	τῶν μὲν ἐγὼν ἦρχον, τῶν δʼ Εὐρύλοχος θεοειδής. κλήρους δʼ ἐν κυνέῃ χαλκήρεϊ πάλλομεν ὦκα· ἐκ δʼ ἔθορε κλῆρος μεγαλήτορος Εὐρυλόχοιο. βῆ δʼ ἰέναι, ἅμα τῷ γε δύω καὶ εἴκοσʼ ἑταῖροι κλαίοντες· κατὰ δʼ ἄμμε λίπον γοόωντας ὄπισθεν.
 with a drill, while those below keep it spinning with the thong, which they lay hold of by either end, and the drill runs around unceasingly. Even so we took the fiery-pointed stake and whirled it around in his eye, and the blood flowed around the heated thing. And his eyelids wholly and his brows round about did the flame singe	εὗρον δʼ ἐν βήσσῃσι τετυγμένα δώματα Κίρκης ξεστοῖσιν λάεσσι, περισκέπτῳ ἐνὶ χώρῳ· ἀμφὶ δέ μιν λύκοι ἦσαν ὀρέστεροι ἠδὲ λέοντες, τοὺς αὐτὴ κατέθελξεν, ἐπεὶ κακὰ φάρμακʼ ἔδωκεν. οὐδʼ οἵ γʼ ὡρμήθησαν ἐπʼ ἀνδράσιν, ἀλλʼ ἄρα τοί γε
 as the eyeball burned, and its roots crackled in the fire. And as when a smith dips a great axe or an adze in cold water amid loud hissing to temper it—for therefrom comes the strength of iron—even so did his eye hiss round the stake of olive-wood.	οὐρῇσιν μακρῇσι περισσαίνοντες ἀνέσταν. ὡς δʼ ὅτʼ ἂν ἀμφὶ ἄνακτα κύνες δαίτηθεν ἰόντα σαίνωσʼ, αἰεὶ γάρ τε φέρει μειλίγματα θυμοῦ, ὣς τοὺς ἀμφὶ λύκοι κρατερώνυχες ἠδὲ λέοντες σαῖνον· τοὶ δʼ ἔδεισαν, ἐπεὶ ἴδον αἰνὰ πέλωρα.
 Terribly then did he cry aloud, and the rock rang around; and we, seized with terror, shrank back, while he wrenched from his eye the stake, all befouled with blood, and flung it from him, wildly waving his arms. Then he called aloud to the Cyclopes, who	ἔσταν δʼ ἐν προθύροισι θεᾶς καλλιπλοκάμοιο, Κίρκης δʼ ἔνδον ἄκουον ἀειδούσης ὀπὶ καλῇ, ἱστὸν ἐποιχομένης μέγαν ἄμβροτον, οἷα θεάων λεπτά τε καὶ χαρίεντα καὶ ἀγλαὰ ἔργα πέλονται. τοῖσι δὲ μύθων ἦρχε Πολίτης ὄρχαμος ἀνδρῶν,
dwelt round about him in caves among the windy heights, and they heard his cry and came thronging from every side, and standing around the cave asked him what ailed him: “‘What so sore distress is thine, Polyphemus, that thou criest out thus through the immortal night, and makest us sleepless?	ὅς μοι κήδιστος ἑτάρων ἦν κεδνότατός τε· ὦ φίλοι, ἔνδον γάρ τις ἐποιχομένη μέγαν ἱστὸν καλὸν ἀοιδιάει, δάπεδον δʼ ἅπαν ἀμφιμέμυκεν, ἢ θεὸς ἠὲ γυνή· ἀλλὰ φθεγγώμεθα θᾶσσον. ὣς ἄρʼ ἐφώνησεν, τοὶ δὲ φθέγγοντο καλεῦντες.
Can it be that some mortal man is driving off thy flocks against thy will, or slaying thee thyself by guile or by might?’ “‘Then from out the cave the mighty Polyphemus answered them: ‘My friends, it is Noman that is slaying me by guile and not by force.’ “And they made answer and addressed him with winged words:	ἡ δʼ αἶψʼ ἐξελθοῦσα θύρας ὤιξε φαεινὰς καὶ κάλει· οἱ δʼ ἅμα πάντες ἀιδρείῃσιν ἕποντο· Εὐρύλοχος δʼ ὑπέμεινεν, ὀισάμενος δόλον εἶναι. εἷσεν δʼ εἰσαγαγοῦσα κατὰ κλισμούς τε θρόνους τε, ἐν δέ σφιν τυρόν τε καὶ ἄλφιτα καὶ μέλι χλωρὸν
‘If, then, no man does violence to thee in thy loneliness, sickness which comes from great Zeus thou mayest in no wise escape. Nay, do thou pray to our father, the lord Poseidon.’ “So they spoke and went their way; and my heart laughed within me that my name and cunning device had so beguiled.	οἴνῳ Πραμνείῳ ἐκύκα· ἀνέμισγε δὲ σίτῳ φάρμακα λύγρʼ, ἵνα πάγχυ λαθοίατο πατρίδος αἴης. αὐτὰρ ἐπεὶ δῶκέν τε καὶ ἔκπιον, αὐτίκʼ ἔπειτα ῥάβδῳ πεπληγυῖα κατὰ συφεοῖσιν ἐέργνυ. οἱ δὲ συῶν μὲν ἔχον κεφαλὰς φωνήν τε τρίχας τε
But the Cyclops , groaning and travailing in anguish, groped with his hands and took away the stone from the door, and himself sat in the doorway with arms outstretched in the hope of catching anyone who sought to go forth with the sheep—so witless, forsooth, he thought in his heart to find me.	καὶ δέμας, αὐτὰρ νοῦς ἦν ἔμπεδος, ὡς τὸ πάρος περ. ὣς οἱ μὲν κλαίοντες ἐέρχατο, τοῖσι δὲ Κίρκη πάρ ῥʼ ἄκυλον βάλανόν τε βάλεν καρπόν τε κρανείης ἔδμεναι, οἷα σύες χαμαιευνάδες αἰὲν ἔδουσιν. Εὐρύλοχος δʼ αἶψʼ ἦλθε θοὴν ἐπὶ νῆα μέλαιναν
 But I took counsel how all might be the very best, if I might haply find some way of escape from death for my comrades and for myself. And I wove all manner of wiles and counsel, as a man will in a matter of life and death; for great was the evil that was nigh us. And this seemed to my mind the best plan.	ἀγγελίην ἑτάρων ἐρέων καὶ ἀδευκέα πότμον. οὐδέ τι ἐκφάσθαι δύνατο ἔπος ἱέμενός περ, κῆρ ἄχεϊ μεγάλῳ βεβολημένος· ἐν δέ οἱ ὄσσε δακρυόφιν πίμπλαντο, γόον δʼ ὠίετο θυμός. ἀλλʼ ὅτε δή μιν πάντες ἀγασσάμεθʼ ἐξερέοντες,
Rams there were, well-fed and thick of fleece, fine beasts and large, with wool dark as the violet. These I silently bound together with twisted withes on which the Cyclops , that monster with his heart set on lawlessness, was wont to sleep. Three at a time I took. The one in the middle in each case bore a man,	καὶ τότε τῶν ἄλλων ἑτάρων κατέλεξεν ὄλεθρον· ἤιομεν, ὡς ἐκέλευες, ἀνὰ δρυμά, φαίδιμʼ Ὀδυσσεῦ· εὕρομεν ἐν βήσσῃσι τετυγμένα δώματα καλὰ ξεστοῖσιν λάεσσι, περισκέπτῳ ἐνὶ χώρῳ. ἔνθα δέ τις μέγαν ἱστὸν ἐποιχομένη λίγʼ ἄειδεν,
 and the other two went, one on either side, saving my comrades. Thus every three sheep bore a man. But as for me—there was a ram, far the best of all the flock; him I grasped by the back, and curled beneath his shaggy belly, lay there face upwards	ἢ θεὸς ἠὲ γυνή· τοὶ δὲ φθέγγοντο καλεῦντες. ἡ δʼ αἶψʼ ἐξελθοῦσα θύρας ὤιξε φαεινὰς καὶ κάλει· οἱ δʼ ἅμα πάντες ἀιδρείῃσιν ἕποντο· αὐτὰρ ἐγὼν ὑπέμεινα, ὀισάμενος δόλον εἶναι. οἱ δʼ ἅμʼ ἀιστώθησαν ἀολλέες, οὐδέ τις αὐτῶν
with steadfast heart, clinging fast with my hands to his wondrous fleece. So then, with wailing, we waited for the bright dawn. “As soon as early Dawn appeared, the rosy-fingered, then the males of the flock hastened forth to pasture and the females bleated unmilked about the pens,	ἐξεφάνη· δηρὸν δὲ καθήμενος ἐσκοπίαζον. ὣς ἔφατʼ, αὐτὰρ ἐγὼ περὶ μὲν ξίφος ἀργυρόηλον ὤμοιιν βαλόμην, μέγα χάλκεον, ἀμφὶ δὲ τόξα· τὸν δʼ ἂψ ἠνώγεα αὐτὴν ὁδὸν ἡγήσασθαι. αὐτὰρ ὅ γʼ ἀμφοτέρῃσι λαβὼν ἐλλίσσετο γούνων
 for their udders were bursting. And their master, distressed with grievous pains, felt along the backs of all the sheep as they stood up before him, but in his folly he marked not this, that my men were bound beneath the breasts of his fleecy sheep. Last of all the flock the ram went forth,	καί μʼ ὀλοφυρόμενος ἔπεα πτερόεντα προσηύδα· μή μʼ ἄγε κεῖσʼ ἀέκοντα, διοτρεφές, ἀλλὰ λίπʼ αὐτοῦ. οἶδα γάρ, ὡς οὔτʼ αὐτὸς ἐλεύσεαι οὔτε τινʼ ἄλλον ἄξεις σῶν ἑτάρων. ἀλλὰ ξὺν τοίσδεσι θᾶσσον φεύγωμεν· ἔτι γάρ κεν ἀλύξαιμεν κακὸν ἦμαρ.
burdened with the weight of his fleece and my cunning self. And mighty Polyphemus, as he felt along his back, spoke to him, saying: “‘Good ram, why pray is it that thou goest forth thus through the cave the last of the flock? Thou hast not heretofore been wont to lag behind the sheep, but wast ever far the first to feed on the tender bloom of the grass,	ὣς ἔφατʼ, αὐτὰρ ἐγώ μιν ἀμειβόμενος προσέειπον· Εὐρύλοχʼ, ἦ τοι μὲν σὺ μένʼ αὐτοῦ τῷδʼ ἐνὶ χώρῳ ἔσθων καὶ πίνων κοίλῃ παρὰ νηὶ μελαίνῃ· αὐτὰρ ἐγὼν εἶμι, κρατερὴ δέ μοι ἔπλετʼ ἀνάγκη. ὣς εἰπὼν παρὰ νηὸς ἀνήιον ἠδὲ θαλάσσης.
 moving with long strides, and ever the first didst reach the streams of the river, and the first didst long to return to the fold at evening. But now thou art last of all. Surely thou art sorrowing for the eye of thy master, which an evil man blinded along with his miserable fellows, when he had overpowered my wits with wine,	ἀλλʼ ὅτε δὴ ἄρʼ ἔμελλον ἰὼν ἱερὰς ἀνὰ βήσσας Κίρκης ἵξεσθαι πολυφαρμάκου ἐς μέγα δῶμα, ἔνθα μοι Ἑρμείας χρυσόρραπις ἀντεβόλησεν ἐρχομένῳ πρὸς δῶμα, νεηνίῃ ἀνδρὶ ἐοικώς, πρῶτον ὑπηνήτῃ, τοῦ περ χαριεστάτη ἥβη·
 even Noman, who, I tell thee, has not yet escaped destruction. If only thou couldst feel as I do, and couldst get thee power of speech to tell me where he skulks away from my wrath, then should his brains be dashed on the ground here and there throughout the cave, when I had smitten him, and my heart	ἔν τʼ ἄρα μοι φῦ χειρί, ἔπος τʼ ἔφατʼ ἔκ τʼ ὀνόμαζε· πῇ δὴ αὖτʼ, ὦ δύστηνε, διʼ ἄκριας ἔρχεαι οἶος, χώρου ἄιδρις ἐών; ἕταροι δέ τοι οἵδʼ ἐνὶ Κίρκης ἔρχαται ὥς τε σύες πυκινοὺς κευθμῶνας ἔχοντες. ἦ τοὺς λυσόμενος δεῦρʼ ἔρχεαι; οὐδέ σέ φημι
should be lightened of the woes which good-for-naught Noman has brought me.’ “So saying, he sent the ram forth from him. And when we had gone a little way from the cave and the court, I first loosed myself from under the ram and set my comrades free. Speedily then we drove off those long-shanked sheep, rich with fat,	αὐτὸν νοστήσειν, μενέεις δὲ σύ γʼ, ἔνθα περ ἄλλοι. ἀλλʼ ἄγε δή σε κακῶν ἐκλύσομαι ἠδὲ σαώσω. τῆ, τόδε φάρμακον ἐσθλὸν ἔχων ἐς δώματα Κίρκης ἔρχευ, ὅ κέν τοι κρατὸς ἀλάλκῃσιν κακὸν ἦμαρ. πάντα δέ τοι ἐρέω ὀλοφώια δήνεα Κίρκης.
 turning full often to look about until we came to the ship. And welcome to our dear comrades was the sight of us who had escaped death, but for the others they wept and wailed; yet I would not suffer them to weep, but with a frown forbade each man. Rather I bade them	τεύξει τοι κυκεῶ, βαλέει δʼ ἐν φάρμακα σίτῳ. ἀλλʼ οὐδʼ ὣς θέλξαι σε δυνήσεται· οὐ γὰρ ἐάσει φάρμακον ἐσθλόν, ὅ τοι δώσω, ἐρέω δὲ ἕκαστα. ὁππότε κεν Κίρκη σʼ ἐλάσῃ περιμήκεϊ ῥάβδῳ, δὴ τότε σὺ ξίφος ὀξὺ ἐρυσσάμενος παρὰ μηροῦ
to fling on board with speed the many sheep of goodly fleece, and sail over the salt water. So they went on board straightway and sat down upon the benches, and sitting well in order smote the grey sea with their oars. But when I was as far away as a man's voice carries when he shouts, then I spoke to the Cyclops with mocking words:	Κίρκῃ ἐπαῖξαι, ὥς τε κτάμεναι μενεαίνων. ἡ δέ σʼ ὑποδείσασα κελήσεται εὐνηθῆναι· ἔνθα σὺ μηκέτʼ ἔπειτʼ ἀπανήνασθαι θεοῦ εὐνήν, ὄφρα κέ τοι λύσῃ θʼ ἑτάρους αὐτόν τε κομίσσῃ· ἀλλὰ κέλεσθαί μιν μακάρων μέγαν ὅρκον ὀμόσσαι,
“‘ Cyclops , that man, it seems, was no weakling, whose comrades thou wast minded to devour by brutal strength in thy hollow cave. Full surely were thy evil deeds to fall on thine own head, thou cruel wretch, who didst not shrink from eating thy guests in thine own house. Therefore has Zeus taken vengeance on thee, and the other gods.’	μή τί τοι αὐτῷ πῆμα κακὸν βουλευσέμεν ἄλλο, μή σʼ ἀπογυμνωθέντα κακὸν καὶ ἀνήνορα θήῃ. ὣς ἄρα φωνήσας πόρε φάρμακον ἀργεϊφόντης ἐκ γαίης ἐρύσας, καί μοι φύσιν αὐτοῦ ἔδειξε. ῥίζῃ μὲν μέλαν ἔσκε, γάλακτι δὲ εἴκελον ἄνθος·
“So I spoke, and he waxed the more wroth at heart, and broke off the peak of a high mountain and hurled it at us, and cast it in front of the dark-prowed ship. And the sea surged beneath the stone as it fell,	μῶλυ δέ μιν καλέουσι θεοί· χαλεπὸν δέ τʼ ὀρύσσειν ἀνδράσι γε θνητοῖσι, θεοὶ δέ τε πάντα δύνανται. Ἑρμείας μὲν ἔπειτʼ ἀπέβη πρὸς μακρὸν Ὄλυμπον νῆσον ἀνʼ ὑλήεσσαν, ἐγὼ δʼ ἐς δώματα Κίρκης ἤια, πολλὰ δέ μοι κραδίη πόρφυρε κιόντι.
 and the backward flow, like a flood from the deep, bore the ship swiftly landwards and drove it upon the shore. But I seized a long pole in my hands and shoved the ship off and along the shore,	ἔστην δʼ εἰνὶ θύρῃσι θεᾶς καλλιπλοκάμοιο· ἔνθα στὰς ἐβόησα, θεὰ δέ μευ ἔκλυεν αὐδῆς. ἡ δʼ αἶψʼ ἐξελθοῦσα θύρας ὤιξε φαεινὰς καὶ κάλει· αὐτὰρ ἐγὼν ἑπόμην ἀκαχήμενος ἦτορ. εἷσε δέ μʼ εἰσαγαγοῦσα ἐπὶ θρόνου ἀργυροήλου
and with a nod of my head I roused my comrades, and bade them fall to their oars that we might escape out of our evil plight. And they bent to their oars and rowed. But when, as we fared over the sea, we were twice as far distant, then was I fain to call to the Cyclops , though round about me my comrades, one after another, sought to check me with gentle words: “‘Reckless one, why wilt thou provoke to wrath a savage man,	καλοῦ δαιδαλέου· ὑπὸ δὲ θρῆνυς ποσὶν ἦεν· τεῦχε δέ μοι κυκεῶ χρυσέῳ δέπαι, ὄφρα πίοιμι, ἐν δέ τε φάρμακον ἧκε, κακὰ φρονέουσʼ ἐνὶ θυμῷ. αὐτὰρ ἐπεὶ δῶκέν τε καὶ ἔκπιον, οὐδέ μʼ ἔθελξε, ῥάβδῳ πεπληγυῖα ἔπος τʼ ἔφατʼ ἔκ τʼ ὀνόμαζεν·
who but now hurled his missile into the deep and drove our ship back to the land, and verily we thought that we had perished there? And had he heard one of us uttering a sound or speaking, he would have hurled a jagged rock and crushed our heads and the timbers of our ship, so mightily does he throw.’	ἔρχεο νῦν συφεόνδε, μετʼ ἄλλων λέξο ἑταίρων. ὣς φάτʼ, ἐγὼ δʼ ἄορ ὀξὺ ἐρυσσάμενος παρὰ μηροῦ Κίρκῃ ἐπήιξα ὥς τε κτάμεναι μενεαίνων. ἡ δὲ μέγα ἰάχουσα ὑπέδραμε καὶ λάβε γούνων, καί μʼ ὀλοφυρομένη ἔπεα πτερόεντα προσηύδα·
“So they spoke, but they could not persuade my great-hearted spirit; and I answered him again with angry heart: “‘ Cyclops , if any one of mortal men shall ask thee about the shameful blinding of thine eye, say that Odysseus, the sacker of cities, blinded it,	τίς πόθεν εἰς ἀνδρῶν; πόθι τοι πόλις ἠδὲ τοκῆες; θαῦμά μʼ ἔχει ὡς οὔ τι πιὼν τάδε φάρμακʼ ἐθέλχθης· οὐδὲ γὰρ οὐδέ τις ἄλλος ἀνὴρ τάδε φάρμακʼ ἀνέτλη, ὅς κε πίῃ καὶ πρῶτον ἀμείψεται ἕρκος ὀδόντων. σοὶ δέ τις ἐν στήθεσσιν ἀκήλητος νόος ἐστίν.
even the son of Laertes, whose home is in Ithaca .’ “So I spoke, and he groaned and said in answer:‘Lo now, verily a prophecy uttered long ago is come upon me. There lived here a soothsayer, a good man and tall, Telemus, son of Eurymus, who excelled all men in soothsaying,	ἦ σύ γʼ Ὀδυσσεύς ἐσσι πολύτροπος, ὅν τέ μοι αἰεὶ φάσκεν ἐλεύσεσθαι χρυσόρραπις ἀργεϊφόντης, ἐκ Τροίης ἀνιόντα θοῇ σὺν νηὶ μελαίνῃ. ἀλλʼ ἄγε δὴ κολεῷ μὲν ἄορ θέο, νῶι δʼ ἔπειτα εὐνῆς ἡμετέρης ἐπιβείομεν, ὄφρα μιγέντε
 and grew old as a seer among the Cyclopes. He told me that all these things should be brought to pass in days to come, that by the hands of Odysseus I should lose my sight. But I ever looked for some tall and comely man to come hither, clothed in great might,	εὐνῇ καὶ φιλότητι πεποίθομεν ἀλλήλοισιν. ὣς ἔφατʼ, αὐτὰρ ἐγώ μιν ἀμειβόμενος προσέειπον· ὦ Κίρκη, πῶς γάρ με κέλεαι σοὶ ἤπιον εἶναι, ἥ μοι σῦς μὲν ἔθηκας ἐνὶ μεγάροισιν ἑταίρους, αὐτὸν δʼ ἐνθάδʼ ἔχουσα δολοφρονέουσα κελεύεις
 but now one that is puny, a man of naught and a weakling, has blinded me of my eye when he had overpowered me with wine. Yet come hither, Odysseus, that I may set before thee gifts of entertainment, and may speed thy sending hence, that the glorious Earth-shaker may grant it thee. For I am his son, and he declares himself my father;	ἐς θάλαμόν τʼ ἰέναι καὶ σῆς ἐπιβήμεναι εὐνῆς, ὄφρα με γυμνωθέντα κακὸν καὶ ἀνήνορα θήῃς. οὐδʼ ἂν ἐγώ γʼ ἐθέλοιμι τεῆς ἐπιβήμεναι εὐνῆς, εἰ μή μοι τλαίης γε, θεά, μέγαν ὅρκον ὀμόσσαι μή τί μοι αὐτῷ πῆμα κακὸν βουλευσέμεν ἄλλο.
and he himself will heal me, if it be his good pleasure, but none other either of the blessed gods or of mortal men.’ “So he spoke, and I answered him and said:‘Would that I were able to rob thee of soul and life, and to send thee to the house of Hades,	ὣς ἐφάμην, ἡ δʼ αὐτίκʼ ἀπώμνυεν, ὡς ἐκέλευον. αὐτὰρ ἐπεί ῥʼ ὄμοσέν τε τελεύτησέν τε τὸν ὅρκον, καὶ τότʼ ἐγὼ Κίρκης ἐπέβην περικαλλέος εὐνῆς. ἀμφίπολοι δʼ ἄρα τέως μὲν ἐνὶ μεγάροισι πένοντο τέσσαρες, αἵ οἱ δῶμα κάτα δρήστειραι ἔασι·
as surely as not even the Earth-shaker shall heal thine eye.’ “So I spoke, and he then prayed to the lord Poseidon, stretching out both his hands to the starry heaven: ‘Hear me, Poseidon, earth-enfolder, thou dark-haired god, if indeed I am thy son and thou declarest thyself my father;	γίγνονται δʼ ἄρα ταί γʼ ἔκ τε κρηνέων ἀπό τʼ ἀλσέων ἔκ θʼ ἱερῶν ποταμῶν, οἵ τʼ εἰς ἅλαδε προρέουσι. τάων ἡ μὲν ἔβαλλε θρόνοις ἔνι ῥήγεα καλὰ πορφύρεα καθύπερθʼ, ὑπένερθε δὲ λῖθʼ ὑπέβαλλεν· ἡ δʼ ἑτέρη προπάροιθε θρόνων ἐτίταινε τραπέζας
grant that Odysseus, the sacker of cities, may never reach his home, even the son of Laertes, whose home is in Ithaca ; but if it is his fate to see his friends and to reach his well-built house and his native land, late may he come and in evil case, after losing all his comrades,	ἀργυρέας, ἐπὶ δέ σφι τίθει χρύσεια κάνεια· ἡ δὲ τρίτη κρητῆρι μελίφρονα οἶνον ἐκίρνα ἡδὺν ἐν ἀργυρέῳ, νέμε δὲ χρύσεια κύπελλα· ἡ δὲ τετάρτη ὕδωρ ἐφόρει καὶ πῦρ ἀνέκαιε πολλὸν ὑπὸ τρίποδι μεγάλῳ· ἰαίνετο δʼ ὕδωρ.
in a ship that is another's; and may he find woes in his house.’ “So he spoke in prayer, and the dark-haired god heard him. But the Cyclops lifted on high again a far greater stone, and swung and hurled it, putting into the throw measureless strength. He cast it	αὐτὰρ ἐπεὶ δὴ ζέσσεν ὕδωρ ἐνὶ ἤνοπι χαλκῷ, ἔς ῥʼ ἀσάμινθον ἕσασα λόʼ ἐκ τρίποδος μεγάλοιο, θυμῆρες κεράσασα, κατὰ κρατός τε καὶ ὤμων, ὄφρα μοι ἐκ κάματον θυμοφθόρον εἵλετο γυίων. αὐτὰρ ἐπεὶ λοῦσέν τε καὶ ἔχρισεν λίπʼ ἐλαίῳ,
a little behind the dark-prowed ship, and barely missed the end of the steering-oar. And the sea surged beneath the stone as it fell, and the wave bore the ship onward and drove it to the shore. “Now when we had come to the island, where our other well-benched ships lay all together, and round about them our comrades,	ἀμφὶ δέ με χλαῖναν καλὴν βάλεν ἠδὲ χιτῶνα, εἷσε δέ μʼ εἰσαγαγοῦσα ἐπὶ θρόνου ἀργυροήλου καλοῦ δαιδαλέου, ὑπὸ δὲ θρῆνυς ποσὶν ἦεν· χέρνιβα δʼ ἀμφίπολος προχόῳ ἐπέχευε φέρουσα καλῇ χρυσείῃ, ὑπὲρ ἀργυρέοιο λέβητος,
ever expecting us, sat weeping, then, on coming thither, we beached our ship on the sands, and ourselves went forth upon the shore of the sea. Then we took from out the hollow ship the flocks of the Cyclops , and divided them, that so far as in me lay no man might go defrauded of an equal share.	νίψασθαι· παρὰ δὲ ξεστὴν ἐτάνυσσε τράπεζαν. σῖτον δʼ αἰδοίη ταμίη παρέθηκε φέρουσα, εἴδατα πόλλʼ ἐπιθεῖσα, χαριζομένη παρεόντων. ἐσθέμεναι δʼ ἐκέλευεν· ἐμῷ δʼ οὐχ ἥνδανε θυμῷ, ἀλλʼ ἥμην ἀλλοφρονέων, κακὰ δʼ ὄσσετο θυμός.
 But the ram my well-greaved comrades gave to me alone, when the flocks were divided, as a gift apart; and on the shore I sacrificed him to Zeus, son of Cronos, god of the dark clouds, who is lord of all, and burned the thigh-pieces. Howbeit he heeded not my sacrifice, but was planning how all	Κίρκη δʼ ὡς ἐνόησεν ἔμʼ ἥμενον οὐδʼ ἐπὶ σίτῳ χεῖρας ἰάλλοντα, κρατερὸν δέ με πένθος ἔχοντα, ἄγχι παρισταμένη ἔπεα πτερόεντα προσηύδα· τίφθʼ οὕτως, Ὀδυσεῦ, κατʼ ἄρʼ ἕζεαι ἶσος ἀναύδῳ, θυμὸν ἔδων, βρώμης δʼ οὐχ ἅπτεαι οὐδὲ ποτῆτος;
my well-benched ships might perish and my trusty comrades. “So, then, all day long till set of sun we sat feasting on abundant flesh and sweet wine; but when the sun set and darkness came on, then we lay down to rest on the shore of the sea.	ἦ τινά που δόλον ἄλλον ὀίεαι· οὐδέ τί σε χρὴ δειδίμεν· ἤδη γάρ τοι ἀπώμοσα καρτερὸν ὅρκον. ὣς ἔφατʼ, αὐτὰρ ἐγώ μιν ἀμειβόμενος προσέειπον· ὦ Κίρκη, τίς γάρ κεν ἀνήρ, ὃς ἐναίσιμος εἴη, πρὶν τλαίη πάσσασθαι ἐδητύος ἠδὲ ποτῆτος,
And as soon as early Dawn appeared, the rosy-fingered, I roused my comrades, and bade them themselves to embark and to loose the stern cables. So they went on board straightway and sat down upon the benches, and sitting well in order smote the grey sea with their oars.	πρὶν λύσασθʼ ἑτάρους καὶ ἐν ὀφθαλμοῖσιν ἰδέσθαι; ἀλλʼ εἰ δὴ πρόφρασσα πιεῖν φαγέμεν τε κελεύεις, λῦσον, ἵνʼ ὀφθαλμοῖσιν ἴδω ἐρίηρας ἑταίρους. ὣς ἐφάμην, Κίρκη δὲ διὲκ μεγάροιο βεβήκει ῥάβδον ἔχουσʼ ἐν χειρί, θύρας δʼ ἀνέῳξε συφειοῦ,
 “Thence we sailed on, grieved at heart, glad to have escaped death, though we had lost our dear comrades.	ἐκ δʼ ἔλασεν σιάλοισιν ἐοικότας ἐννεώροισιν. οἱ μὲν ἔπειτʼ ἔστησαν ἐναντίοι, ἡ δὲ διʼ αὐτῶν ἐρχομένη προσάλειφεν ἑκάστῳ φάρμακον ἄλλο. τῶν δʼ ἐκ μὲν μελέων τρίχες ἔρρεον, ἃς πρὶν ἔφυσε φάρμακον οὐλόμενον, τό σφιν πόρε πότνια Κίρκη·
 “Then to the Aeolian isle we came, where dwelt Aeolus, son of Hippotas, dear to the immortal gods, in a floating island, and all around it is a wall of unbreakable bronze, and the cliff runs up sheer.	ἡ δέ μευ ἄγχι στᾶσα προσηύδα δῖα θεάων· διογενὲς Λαερτιάδη, πολυμήχανʼ Ὀδυσσεῦ, ἔρχεο νῦν ἐπὶ νῆα θοὴν καὶ θῖνα θαλάσσης. νῆα μὲν ἂρ πάμπρωτον ἐρύσσατε ἤπειρόνδε, κτήματα δʼ ἐν σπήεσσι πελάσσατε ὅπλα τε πάντα·
 Twelve children of his, too, there are in the halls, six daughters and six sturdy sons, and he gave his daughters to his sons to wife. These, then, feast continually by their dear father and good mother, and before them lies boundless good cheer.	αὐτὸς δʼ ἂψ ἰέναι καὶ ἄγειν ἐρίηρας ἑταίρους. ὣς ἔφατʼ, αὐτὰρ ἐμοί γʼ ἐπεπείθετο θυμὸς ἀγήνωρ, βῆν δʼ ἰέναι ἐπὶ νῆα θοὴν καὶ θῖνα θαλάσσης. εὗρον ἔπειτʼ ἐπὶ νηὶ θοῇ ἐρίηρας ἑταίρους οἴκτρʼ ὀλοφυρομένους, θαλερὸν κατὰ δάκρυ χέοντας.
And the house, filled with the savour of feasting, resounds all about even in the outer court by day, and by night again they sleep beside their chaste wives on blankets and on corded bedsteads. To their city, then, and fair palace did we come, and for a full month he made me welcome and questioned me about each thing,	ὡς δʼ ὅτʼ ἂν ἄγραυλοι πόριες περὶ βοῦς ἀγελαίας, ἐλθούσας ἐς κόπρον, ἐπὴν βοτάνης κορέσωνται, πᾶσαι ἅμα σκαίρουσιν ἐναντίαι· οὐδʼ ἔτι σηκοὶ ἴσχουσʼ, ἀλλʼ ἁδινὸν μυκώμεναι ἀμφιθέουσι· μητέρας· ὣς ἔμʼ ἐκεῖνοι ἐπεὶ ἴδον ὀφθαλμοῖσι,
about Ilios , and the ships of the Argives, and the return of the Achaeans. And I told him all the tale in due order. But when I, on my part, asked him that I might depart and bade him send me on my way, he, too, denied me nothing, but furthered my sending. He gave me a wallet, made of the hide of an ox nine years old, which he flayed,	δακρυόεντες ἔχυντο· δόκησε δʼ ἄρα σφίσι θυμὸς ὣς ἔμεν, ὡς εἰ πατρίδʼ ἱκοίατο καὶ πόλιν αὐτὴν τρηχείης Ἰθάκης, ἵνα τʼ ἔτραφεν ἠδʼ ἐγένοντο. καί μʼ ὀλοφυρόμενοι ἔπεα πτερόεντα προσηύδων· σοὶ μὲν νοστήσαντι, διοτρεφές, ὣς ἐχάρημεν,
 and therein he bound the paths of the blustering winds; for the son of Cronos had made him keeper of the winds, both to still and to rouse whatever one he will. And in my hollow ship he bound it fast with a bright cord of silver, that not a breath might escape, were it never so slight.	ὡς εἴ τʼ εἰς Ἰθάκην ἀφικοίμεθα πατρίδα γαῖαν· ἀλλʼ ἄγε, τῶν ἄλλων ἑτάρων κατάλεξον ὄλεθρον. ὣς ἔφαν, αὐτὰρ ἐγὼ προσέφην μαλακοῖς ἐπέεσσι· νῆα μὲν ἂρ πάμπρωτον ἐρύσσομεν ἤπειρόνδε, κτήματα δʼ ἐν σπήεσσι πελάσσομεν ὅπλα τε πάντα·
But for my furtherance he sent forth the breath of the West Wind to blow, that it might bear on their way both ships and men. Yet this he was not to bring to pass, for we were lost through our own folly. “For nine days we sailed, night and day alike, and now on the tenth our native land came in sight,	αὐτοὶ δʼ ὀτρύνεσθε ἐμοὶ ἅμα πάντες ἕπεσθαι, ὄφρα ἴδηθʼ ἑτάρους ἱεροῖς ἐν δώμασι Κίρκης πίνοντας καὶ ἔδοντας· ἐπηετανὸν γὰρ ἔχουσιν. ὣς ἐφάμην, οἱ δʼ ὦκα ἐμοῖς ἐπέεσσι πίθοντο. Εὐρύλοχος δέ μοι οἶος ἐρύκανε πάντας ἑταίρους·
and lo, we were so near that we saw men tending the beacon fires. Then upon me came sweet sleep in my weariness, for I had ever kept in hand the sheet of the ship, and had yielded it to none other of my comrades, that we might the sooner come to our native land. But my comrades meanwhile began to speak one to another,	καί σφεας φωνήσας ἔπεα πτερόεντα προσηύδα· ἆ δειλοί, πόσʼ ἴμεν; τί κακῶν ἱμείρετε τούτων; Κίρκης ἐς μέγαρον καταβήμεναι, ἥ κεν ἅπαντας ἢ σῦς ἠὲ λύκους ποιήσεται ἠὲ λέοντας, οἵ κέν οἱ μέγα δῶμα φυλάσσοιμεν καὶ ἀνάγκῃ,
and said that I was bringing home for myself gold and silver as gifts from Aeolus, the great-hearted son of Hippotas. And thus would one speak, with a glance at his neighbor: “‘Out on it, how beloved and honored this man is by all men, to whose city and land soever he comes!	ὥς περ Κύκλωψ ἔρξʼ, ὅτε οἱ μέσσαυλον ἵκοντο ἡμέτεροι ἕταροι, σὺν δʼ ὁ θρασὺς εἵπετʼ Ὀδυσσεύς· τούτου γὰρ καὶ κεῖνοι ἀτασθαλίῃσιν ὄλοντο. ὣς ἔφατʼ, αὐτὰρ ἐγώ γε μετὰ φρεσὶ μερμήριξα, σπασσάμενος τανύηκες ἄορ παχέος παρὰ μηροῦ,
Much goodly treasure is he carrying with him from the land of Troy from out the spoil, while we, who have accomplished the same journey as he, are returning, bearing with us empty hands. And now Aeolus has given him these gifts, granting them freely of his love. Nay, come, let us quickly see what is here,	τῷ οἱ ἀποπλήξας κεφαλὴν οὖδάσδε πελάσσαι, καὶ πηῷ περ ἐόντι μάλα σχεδόν· ἀλλά μʼ ἑταῖροι μειλιχίοις ἐπέεσσιν ἐρήτυον ἄλλοθεν ἄλλος· διογενές, τοῦτον μὲν ἐάσομεν, εἰ σὺ κελεύεις, αὐτοῦ πὰρ νηί τε μένειν καὶ νῆα ἔρυσθαι·
what store of gold and silver is in the wallet.’ “So they spoke, and the evil counsel of my comrades prevailed. They loosed the wallet, and all the winds leapt forth, and swiftly the storm-wind seized them and bore them weeping out to sea away from their native land; but as for me,	ἡμῖν δʼ ἡγεμόνευʼ ἱερὰ πρὸς δώματα Κίρκης. ὣς φάμενοι παρὰ νηὸς ἀνήιον ἠδὲ θαλάσσης. οὐδὲ μὲν Εὐρύλοχος κοίλῃ παρὰ νηὶ λέλειπτο, ἀλλʼ ἕπετʼ· ἔδεισεν γὰρ ἐμὴν ἔκπαγλον ἐνιπήν. τόφρα δὲ τοὺς ἄλλους ἑτάρους ἐν δώμασι Κίρκη
 I awoke, and pondered in my goodly heart whether I should fling myself from the ship and perish in the sea, or endure in silence and still remain among the living. However, I endured and abode, and covering my head lay down in the ship. But the ships were borne by an evil blast of wind	ἐνδυκέως λοῦσέν τε καὶ ἔχρισεν λίπʼ ἐλαίῳ, ἀμφὶ δʼ ἄρα χλαίνας οὔλας βάλεν ἠδὲ χιτῶνας· δαινυμένους δʼ ἐὺ πάντας ἐφεύρομεν ἐν μεγάροισιν. οἱ δʼ ἐπεὶ ἀλλήλους εἶδον φράσσαντό τʼ ἐσάντα, κλαῖον ὀδυρόμενοι, περὶ δὲ στεναχίζετο δῶμα.
back to the Aeolian isle; and my comrades groaned. “There we went ashore and drew water, and straightway my comrades took their meal by the swift ships. But when we had tasted of food and drink, I took with me a herald and one companion	ἡ δέ μευ ἄγχι στᾶσα προσηύδα δῖα θεάων· μηκέτι νῦν θαλερὸν γόον ὄρνυτε· οἶδα καὶ αὐτὴ ἠμὲν ὅσʼ ἐν πόντῳ πάθετʼ ἄλγεα ἰχθυόεντι, ἠδʼ ὅσʼ ἀνάρσιοι ἄνδρες ἐδηλήσαντʼ ἐπὶ χέρσου.
and went to the glorious palace of Aeolus, and I found him feasting beside his wife and his children. So we entered the house and sat down by the doorposts on the threshold, and they were amazed at heart, and questioned us: “‘How hast thou come hither, Odysseus? What cruel god assailed thee?	ἀλλʼ ἄγετʼ ἐσθίετε βρώμην καὶ πίνετε οἶνον, εἰς ὅ κεν αὖτις θυμὸν ἐνὶ στήθεσσι λάβητε, οἷον ὅτε πρώτιστον ἐλείπετε πατρίδα γαῖαν τρηχείης Ἰθάκης. νῦν δʼ ἀσκελέες καὶ ἄθυμοι, αἰὲν ἄλης χαλεπῆς μεμνημένοι, οὐδέ ποθʼ ὕμιν
Surely we sent thee forth with kindly care, that thou mightest reach thy native land and thy home, and whatever place thou wouldest.’ “So said they, but I with a sorrowing heart spoke among them and said: ‘Bane did my evil comrades work me, and therewith sleep accursed; but bring ye healing, my friends, for with you is the power.’	θυμὸς ἐν εὐφροσύνῃ, ἐπεὶ ἦ μάλα πολλὰ πέποσθε. ὣς ἔφαθʼ, ἡμῖν δʼ αὖτʼ ἐπεπείθετο θυμὸς ἀγήνωρ. ἔνθα μὲν ἤματα πάντα τελεσφόρον εἰς ἐνιαυτὸν ἥμεθα δαινύμενοι κρέα τʼ ἄσπετα καὶ μέθυ ἡδύ· ἀλλʼ ὅτε δή ῥʼ ἐνιαυτὸς ἔην, περὶ δʼ ἔτραπον ὧραι
“So I spoke and addressed them with gentle words, but they were silent. Then their father answered and said: “‘Begone from our island with speed, thou vilest of all that live. In no wise may I help or send upon his way that man who is hated of the blessed gods.	μηνῶν φθινόντων, περὶ δʼ ἤματα μακρὰ τελέσθη, καὶ τότε μʼ ἐκκαλέσαντες ἔφαν ἐρίηρες ἑταῖροι· δαιμόνιʼ, ἤδη νῦν μιμνήσκεο πατρίδος αἴης, εἴ τοι θέσφατόν ἐστι σαωθῆναι καὶ ἱκέσθαι οἶκον ἐς ὑψόροφον καὶ σὴν ἐς πατρίδα γαῖαν.
 So for six days we sailed, night and day alike, and on the seventh we came to the lofty citadel of Lamus, even to Telepylus of the Laestrygonians, where herdsman calls to herdsman as he drives in his flock, and the other answers as he drives his forth. There a man who never slept could have earned a double wage,	ὣς ἔφαν, αὐτὰρ ἐμοί γʼ ἐπεπείθετο θυμὸς ἀγήνωρ. ὣς τότε μὲν πρόπαν ἦμαρ ἐς ἠέλιον καταδύντα ἥμεθα, δαινύμενοι κρέα τʼ ἄσπετα καὶ μέθυ ἡδύ· ἦμος δʼ ἠέλιος κατέδυ καὶ ἐπὶ κνέφας ἦλθεν, οἱ μὲν κοιμήσαντο κατὰ μέγαρα σκιόεντα.
one by herding cattle, and one by pasturing white sheep; for the out goings of the night and of the day are close together. When we had come thither into the goodly harbor, about which on both sides a sheer cliff runs continuously, and projecting headlands opposite to one another	αὐτὰρ ἐγὼ Κίρκης ἐπιβὰς περικαλλέος εὐνῆς γούνων ἐλλιτάνευσα, θεὰ δέ μευ ἔκλυεν αὐδῆς· καί μιν φωνήσας ἔπεα πτερόεντα προσηύδων· ὢ Κίρκη, τέλεσόν μοι ὑπόσχεσιν ἥν περ ὑπέστης, οἴκαδε πεμψέμεναι· θυμὸς δέ μοι ἔσσυται ἤδη,
 stretch out at the mouth, and the entrance is narrow, then all the rest steered their curved ships in, and the ships were moored within the hollow harbor close together; for therein no wave ever swelled, great or small, but all about was a bright calm.	ἠδʼ ἄλλων ἑτάρων, οἵ μευ φθινύθουσι φίλον κῆρ ἀμφʼ ἔμʼ ὀδυρόμενοι, ὅτε που σύ γε νόσφι γένηαι. ὣς ἐφάμην, ἡ δʼ αὐτίκʼ ἀμείβετο δῖα θεάων· διογενὲς Λαερτιάδη, πολυμήχανʼ Ὀδυσσεῦ, μηκέτι νῦν ἀέκοντες ἐμῷ ἐνὶ μίμνετε οἴκῳ.
 But I alone moored my black ship outside, there on the border of the land, making the cables fast to the rock. Then I climbed to a rugged height, a point of outlook, and there took my stand; from thence no works of oxen or of men appeared; smoke alone we saw springing up from the land.	ἀλλʼ ἄλλην χρὴ πρῶτον ὁδὸν τελέσαι καὶ ἱκέσθαι εἰς Ἀίδαο δόμους καὶ ἐπαινῆς Περσεφονείης, ψυχῇ χρησομένους Θηβαίου Τειρεσίαο, μάντηος ἀλαοῦ, τοῦ τε φρένες ἔμπεδοί εἰσι· τῷ καὶ τεθνηῶτι νόον πόρε Περσεφόνεια,
 So then I sent forth some of my comrades to go and learn who the men were, who here ate bread upon the earth—two men I chose, and sent with them a third as a herald. Now when they had gone ashore, they went along a smooth road by which wagons were wont to bring wood down to the city from the high mountains.	οἴῳ πεπνῦσθαι, τοὶ δὲ σκιαὶ ἀίσσουσιν. ὣς ἔφατʼ, αὐτὰρ ἐμοί γε κατεκλάσθη φίλον ἦτορ· κλαῖον δʼ ἐν λεχέεσσι καθήμενος, οὐδέ νύ μοι κῆρ ἤθελʼ ἔτι ζώειν καὶ ὁρᾶν φάος ἠελίοιο. αὐτὰρ ἐπεὶ κλαίων τε κυλινδόμενος τʼ ἐκορέσθην,
And before the city they met a maiden drawing water, the goodly daughter of Laestrygonian Antiphates, who had come down to the fair-flowing spring Artacia, from whence they were wont to bear water to the town. So they came up to her and spoke to her,	καὶ τότε δή μιν ἔπεσσιν ἀμειβόμενος προσέειπον· ὢ Κίρκη, τίς γὰρ ταύτην ὁδὸν ἡγεμονεύσει; εἰς Ἄϊδος δʼ οὔ πώ τις ἀφίκετο νηὶ μελαίνῃ. ὣς ἐφάμην, ἡ δʼ αὐτίκʼ ἀμείβετο δῖα θεάων· διογενὲς Λαερτιάδη, πολυμήχανʼ Ὀδυσσεῦ,
 and asked her who was king of this folk, and who they were of whom he was lord. And she showed them forth with the high-roofed house of her father. Now when they had entered the glorious house, they found there his wife, huge as the peak of a mountain, and they were aghast at her. At once she called from the place of assembly the glorious Antiphates,	μή τί τοι ἡγεμόνος γε ποθὴ παρὰ νηὶ μελέσθω, ἱστὸν δὲ στήσας, ἀνά θʼ ἱστία λευκὰ πετάσσας ἧσθαι· τὴν δέ κέ τοι πνοιὴ Βορέαο φέρῃσιν. ἀλλʼ ὁπότʼ ἂν δὴ νηὶ διʼ Ὠκεανοῖο περήσῃς, ἔνθʼ ἀκτή τε λάχεια καὶ ἄλσεα Περσεφονείης,
 her husband, and he devised for them woeful destruction. Straightway he seized one of my comrades and made ready his meal, but the other two sprang up and came in flight to the ships. Then he raised a cry throughout the city, and as they heard it the mighty Laestrygonians came thronging from all sides,	μακραί τʼ αἴγειροι καὶ ἰτέαι ὠλεσίκαρποι, νῆα μὲν αὐτοῦ κέλσαι ἐπʼ Ὠκεανῷ βαθυδίνῃ, αὐτὸς δʼ εἰς Ἀίδεω ἰέναι δόμον εὐρώεντα. ἔνθα μὲν εἰς Ἀχέροντα Πυριφλεγέθων τε ῥέουσιν Κώκυτός θʼ, ὃς δὴ Στυγὸς ὕδατός ἐστιν ἀπορρώξ,
 a host past counting, not like men but like the Giants. They hurled at us from the cliffs with rocks huge as a man could lift, and at once there rose throughout the ships a dreadful din, alike from men that were dying and from ships that were being crushed. And spearing them like fishes they bore them home, a loathly meal.	πέτρη τε ξύνεσίς τε δύω ποταμῶν ἐριδούπων· ἔνθα δʼ ἔπειθʼ, ἥρως, χριμφθεὶς πέλας, ὥς σε κελεύω, βόθρον ὀρύξαι, ὅσον τε πυγούσιον ἔνθα καὶ ἔνθα, ἀμφʼ αὐτῷ δὲ χοὴν χεῖσθαι πᾶσιν νεκύεσσιν, πρῶτα μελικρήτῳ, μετέπειτα δὲ ἡδέι οἴνῳ,
 Now while they were slaying those within the deep harbor, I meanwhile drew my sharp sword from beside my thigh, and cut therewith the cables of my dark-prowed ship; and quickly calling to my comrades bade them fall to their oars, that we might escape from out our evil plight.	τὸ τρίτον αὖθʼ ὕδατι· ἐπὶ δʼ ἄλφιτα λευκὰ παλύνειν. πολλὰ δὲ γουνοῦσθαι νεκύων ἀμενηνὰ κάρηνα, ἐλθὼν εἰς Ἰθάκην στεῖραν βοῦν, ἥ τις ἀρίστη, ῥέξειν ἐν μεγάροισι πυρήν τʼ ἐμπλησέμεν ἐσθλῶν, Τειρεσίῃ δʼ ἀπάνευθεν ὄιν ἱερευσέμεν οἴῳ
And they all tossed the sea with their oar-blades in fear of death, and joyfully seaward, away from the beetling cliffs, my ship sped on; but all those other ships were lost together there. “Thence we sailed on, grieved at heart, glad to have escaped death, though we had lost our dear comrades;	παμμέλανʼ, ὃς μήλοισι μεταπρέπει ὑμετέροισιν. αὐτὰρ ἐπὴν εὐχῇσι λίσῃ κλυτὰ ἔθνεα νεκρῶν, ἔνθʼ ὄιν ἀρνειὸν ῥέζειν θῆλύν τε μέλαιναν εἰς Ἔρεβος στρέψας, αὐτὸς δʼ ἀπονόσφι τραπέσθαι ἱέμενος ποταμοῖο ῥοάων· ἔνθα δὲ πολλαὶ
and we came to the isle of Aeaea, where dwelt fair-tressed Circe, a dread goddess of human speech, own sister to Aeetes of baneful mind; and both are sprung from Helius, who gives light to mortals, and from Perse , their mother, whom Oceanus begot.	ψυχαὶ ἐλεύσονται νεκύων κατατεθνηώτων. δὴ τότʼ ἔπειθʼ ἑτάροισιν ἐποτρῦναι καὶ ἀνῶξαι μῆλα, τὰ δὴ κατάκειτʼ ἐσφαγμένα νηλέι χαλκῷ, δείραντας κατακῆαι, ἐπεύξασθαι δὲ θεοῖσιν, ἰφθίμῳ τʼ Ἀίδῃ καὶ ἐπαινῇ Περσεφονείῃ·
 Here we put in to shore with our ship in silence, into a harbor where ships may lie, and some god guided us. Then we disembarked, and lay there for two days and two nights, eating our hearts for weariness and sorrow. But when fair-tressed Dawn brought to its birth the third day,	αὐτὸς δὲ ξίφος ὀξὺ ἐρυσσάμενος παρὰ μηροῦ ἧσθαι, μηδὲ ἐᾶν νεκύων ἀμενηνὰ κάρηνα αἵματος ἆσσον ἴμεν, πρὶν Τειρεσίαο πυθέσθαι. ἔνθα τοι αὐτίκα μάντις ἐλεύσεται, ὄρχαμε λαῶν, ὅς κέν τοι εἴπῃσιν ὁδὸν καὶ μέτρα κελεύθου
 then I took my spear and my sharp sword, and quickly went up from the ship to a place of wide prospect, in the hope that I might see the works of men, and hear their voice. So I climbed to a rugged height, a place of outlook, and there took my stand, and I saw smoke rising from the broad-wayed earth	νόστον θʼ, ὡς ἐπὶ πόντον ἐλεύσεαι ἰχθυόεντα. ὣς ἔφατʼ, αὐτίκα δὲ χρυσόθρονος ἤλυθεν Ἠώς. ἀμφὶ δέ με χλαῖνάν τε χιτῶνά τε εἵματα ἕσσεν· αὐτὴ δʼ ἀργύφεον φᾶρος μέγα ἕννυτο νύμφη, λεπτὸν καὶ χαρίεν, περὶ δὲ ζώνην βάλετʼ ἰξυῖ
 in the halls of Circe, through the thick brush and the wood. And I debated in mind and heart, whether I should go and make search, when I had seen the flaming smoke. And as I pondered, this seemed to me to be the better way, to go first to the swift ship and the shore of the sea,	καλὴν χρυσείην, κεφαλῇ δʼ ἐπέθηκε καλύπτρην. αὐτὰρ ἐγὼ διὰ δώματʼ ἰὼν ὤτρυνον ἑταίρους μειλιχίοις ἐπέεσσι παρασταδὸν ἄνδρα ἕκαστον· μηκέτι νῦν εὕδοντες ἀωτεῖτε γλυκὺν ὕπνον, ἀλλʼ ἴομεν· δὴ γάρ μοι ἐπέφραδε πότνια Κίρκη.
 and give my comrades their meal, and send them forth to make search. But when, as I went, I was near to the curved ship, then some god took pity on me in my loneliness, and sent a great, high-horned stag into my very path. He was coming down to the river from his pasture in the wood	ὣς ἐφάμην, τοῖσιν δʼ ἐπεπείθετο θυμὸς ἀγήνωρ. οὐδὲ μὲν οὐδʼ ἔνθεν περ ἀπήμονας ἦγον ἑταίρους. Ἐλπήνωρ δέ τις ἔσκε νεώτατος, οὔτε τι λίην ἄλκιμος ἐν πολέμῳ οὔτε φρεσὶν ᾗσιν ἀρηρώς· ὅς μοι ἄνευθʼ ἑτάρων ἱεροῖς ἐν δώμασι Κίρκης,
 to drink, for the might of the sun oppressed him; and as he came out I struck him on the spine in the middle of the back, and the bronze spear passed right through him, and down he fell in the dust with a moan, and his spirit flew from him. Then I planted my foot upon him,	ψύχεος ἱμείρων, κατελέξατο οἰνοβαρείων. κινυμένων δʼ ἑτάρων ὅμαδον καὶ δοῦπον ἀκούσας ἐξαπίνης ἀνόρουσε καὶ ἐκλάθετο φρεσὶν ᾗσιν ἄψορρον καταβῆναι ἰὼν ἐς κλίμακα μακρήν, ἀλλὰ καταντικρὺ τέγεος πέσεν· ἐκ δέ οἱ αὐχὴν ἀστραγάλων ἐάγη, ψυχὴ δʼ Ἄϊδόσδε κατῆλθεν. ἐρχομένοισι δὲ τοῖσιν ἐγὼ μετὰ μῦθον ἔειπον· φάσθε νύ που οἶκόνδε φίλην ἐς πατρίδα γαῖαν ἔρχεσθʼ· ἄλλην δʼ ἧμιν ὁδὸν τεκμήρατο Κίρκη, εἰς Ἀίδαο δόμους καὶ ἐπαινῆς Περσεφονείης ψυχῇ χρησομένους Θηβαίου Τειρεσίαο. ὣς ἐφάμην, τοῖσιν δὲ κατεκλάσθη φίλον ἦτορ, ἑζόμενοι δὲ κατʼ αὖθι γόων τίλλοντό τε χαίτας· ἀλλʼ οὐ γάρ τις πρῆξις ἐγίγνετο μυρομένοισιν. ἀλλʼ ὅτε δή ῥʼ ἐπὶ νῆα θοὴν καὶ θῖνα θαλάσσης
 and drew the bronze spear forth from the wound, and left it there to lie on the ground. But for myself, I plucked twigs and osiers, and weaving a rope as it were a fathom in length, well twisted from end to end, I bound together the feet of the monstrous beast, and went my way to the black ship, bearing him across my back and	ᾔομεν ἀχνύμενοι θαλερὸν κατὰ δάκρυ χέοντες, τόφρα δʼ ἄρʼ οἰχομένη Κίρκη παρὰ νηὶ μελαίνῃ ἀρνειὸν κατέδησεν ὄιν θῆλύν τε μέλαιναν, ῥεῖα παρεξελθοῦσα· τίς ἂν θεὸν οὐκ ἐθέλοντα ὀφθαλμοῖσιν ἴδοιτʼ ἢ ἔνθʼ ἢ ἔνθα κιόντα;
to the house of Hades, despite our sorrows, before the day of fate comes upon us. Nay, come, while there is yet food and drink in our swift ship, let us bethink us of food, that we pine not with hunger.’ “So I spoke, and they quickly hearkened to my words. From their faces they drew their cloaks,	αὐτὰρ ἐπεί ῥʼ ἐπὶ νῆα κατήλθομεν ἠδὲ θάλασσαν, νῆα μὲν ἂρ πάμπρωτον ἐρύσσαμεν εἰς ἅλα δῖαν, ἐν δʼ ἱστὸν τιθέμεσθα καὶ ἱστία νηὶ μελαίνῃ, ἐν δὲ τὰ μῆλα λαβόντες ἐβήσαμεν, ἂν δὲ καὶ αὐτοὶ
 and marvelled at the stag on the shore of the unresting sea, for he was a very mighty beast. But when they had satisfied their eyes with gazing, they washed their hands, and made ready a glorious feast. So then all day long till set of sun we sat feasting on abundant flesh and sweet wine.	βαίνομεν ἀχνύμενοι θαλερὸν κατὰ δάκρυ χέοντες. ἡμῖν δʼ αὖ κατόπισθε νεὸς κυανοπρῴροιο ἴκμενον οὖρον ἵει πλησίστιον, ἐσθλὸν ἑταῖρον, Κίρκη εὐπλόκαμος, δεινὴ θεὸς αὐδήεσσα. ἡμεῖς δʼ ὅπλα ἕκαστα πονησάμενοι κατὰ νῆα
But when the sun set and darkness came on, then we lay down to rest on the shore of the sea. And as soon as early Dawn appeared, the rosy-fingered, I called my men together, and spoke among them all: “‘Hearken to my words, comrades, for all your evil plight.	ἥμεθα· τὴν δʼ ἄνεμός τε κυβερνήτης τʼ ἴθυνε. τῆς δὲ πανημερίης τέταθʼ ἱστία ποντοπορούσης· δύσετό τʼ ἠέλιος σκιόωντό τε πᾶσαι ἀγυιαί. ἡ δʼ ἐς πείραθʼ ἵκανε βαθυρρόου Ὠκεανοῖο. ἔνθα δὲ Κιμμερίων ἀνδρῶν δῆμός τε πόλις τε,
 My friends, we know not where the darkness is or where the dawn, neither where the sun, who give light to mortals, goes beneath the earth, nor where he rises; but let us straightway take thought if any device be still left us. As for me I think not that there is. For I climbed to a rugged point of outlook, and beheld	ἠέρι καὶ νεφέλῃ κεκαλυμμένοι· οὐδέ ποτʼ αὐτοὺς ἠέλιος φαέθων καταδέρκεται ἀκτίνεσσιν, οὔθʼ ὁπότʼ ἂν στείχῃσι πρὸς οὐρανὸν ἀστερόεντα, οὔθʼ ὅτʼ ἂν ἂψ ἐπὶ γαῖαν ἀπʼ οὐρανόθεν προτράπηται, ἀλλʼ ἐπὶ νὺξ ὀλοὴ τέταται δειλοῖσι βροτοῖσι.
the island, about which is set as a crown the boundless deep. The isle itself lies low, and in the midst of it my eyes saw smoke through the thick brush and the wood.’ “So I spoke, and their spirit was broken within them, as they remembered the deeds of the Laestrygonian, Antiphates,	νῆα μὲν ἔνθʼ ἐλθόντες ἐκέλσαμεν, ἐκ δὲ τὰ μῆλα εἱλόμεθʼ· αὐτοὶ δʼ αὖτε παρὰ ῥόον Ὠκεανοῖο ᾔομεν, ὄφρʼ ἐς χῶρον ἀφικόμεθʼ, ὃν φράσε Κίρκη. ἔνθʼ ἱερήια μὲν Περιμήδης Εὐρύλοχός τε ἔσχον· ἐγὼ δʼ ἄορ ὀξὺ ἐρυσσάμενος παρὰ μηροῦ
and the violence of the great-hearted Cyclops , the man-eater. And they wailed aloud, and shed big tears. But no good came of their mourning. “Then I told off in two bands all my well-greaved comrades, and appointed a leader for each band.	βόθρον ὄρυξʼ ὅσσον τε πυγούσιον ἔνθα καὶ ἔνθα, ἀμφʼ αὐτῷ δὲ χοὴν χεόμην πᾶσιν νεκύεσσι, πρῶτα μελικρήτῳ, μετέπειτα δὲ ἡδέι οἴνῳ, τὸ τρίτον αὖθʼ ὕδατι· ἐπὶ δʼ ἄλφιτα λευκὰ πάλυνον. πολλὰ δὲ γουνούμην νεκύων ἀμενηνὰ κάρηνα,
Of the one I took command, and of the other godlike Eurylochus. Quickly then we shook lots in a brazen helmet, and out leapt the lot of great-hearted Eurylochus. So he set out, and with him went two-and-twenty comrades, all weeping; and they left us behind, lamenting.	ἐλθὼν εἰς Ἰθάκην στεῖραν βοῦν, ἥ τις ἀρίστη, ῥέξειν ἐν μεγάροισι πυρήν τʼ ἐμπλησέμεν ἐσθλῶν, Τειρεσίῃ δʼ ἀπάνευθεν ὄιν ἱερευσέμεν οἴῳ παμμέλανʼ, ὃς μήλοισι μεταπρέπει ἡμετέροισι. τοὺς δʼ ἐπεὶ εὐχωλῇσι λιτῇσί τε, ἔθνεα νεκρῶν,
Within the forest glades they found the house of Circe, built of polished stone in a place of wide outlook, and round about it were mountain wolves and lions, whom Circe herself had bewitched; for she gave them evil drugs. Yet these beasts did not rush upon my men,	ἐλλισάμην, τὰ δὲ μῆλα λαβὼν ἀπεδειροτόμησα ἐς βόθρον, ῥέε δʼ αἷμα κελαινεφές· αἱ δʼ ἀγέροντο ψυχαὶ ὑπὲξ Ἐρέβευς νεκύων κατατεθνηώτων. νύμφαι τʼ ἠίθεοί τε πολύτλητοί τε γέροντες παρθενικαί τʼ ἀταλαὶ νεοπενθέα θυμὸν ἔχουσαι,
 but pranced about them fawningly, wagging their long tails. And as when hounds fawn around their master as he comes from a feast, for he ever brings them bits to soothe their temper, so about them fawned the stout-clawed wolves and lions; but they were seized with fear, as they saw the dread monsters.	πολλοὶ δʼ οὐτάμενοι χαλκήρεσιν ἐγχείῃσιν, ἄνδρες ἀρηίφατοι βεβροτωμένα τεύχεʼ ἔχοντες· οἳ πολλοὶ περὶ βόθρον ἐφοίτων ἄλλοθεν ἄλλος θεσπεσίῃ ἰαχῇ· ἐμὲ δὲ χλωρὸν δέος ᾕρει. δὴ τότʼ ἔπειθʼ ἑτάροισιν ἐποτρύνας ἐκέλευσα
 So they stood in the gateway of the fair-tressed goddess, and within they heard Circe singing with sweet voice, as she went to and fro before a great imperishable web, such as is the handiwork of goddesses, finely-woven and beautiful, and glorious. Then among them spoke Polites, a leader of men,	μῆλα, τὰ δὴ κατέκειτʼ ἐσφαγμένα νηλέι χαλκῷ, δείραντας κατακῆαι, ἐπεύξασθαι δὲ θεοῖσιν, ἰφθίμῳ τʼ Ἀΐδῃ καὶ ἐπαινῇ Περσεφονείῃ· αὐτὸς δὲ ξίφος ὀξὺ ἐρυσσάμενος παρὰ μηροῦ ἥμην, οὐδʼ εἴων νεκύων ἀμενηνὰ κάρηνα
dearest to me of my comrades, and trustiest: “‘Friends, within someone goes to and fro before a great web, singing sweetly, so that all the floor echoes; some goddess it is, or some woman. Come, let us quickly call to her.’ “So he spoke, and they cried aloud, and called to her.	αἵματος ἆσσον ἴμεν, πρὶν Τειρεσίαο πυθέσθαι. πρώτη δὲ ψυχὴ Ἐλπήνορος ἦλθεν ἑταίρου· οὐ γάρ πω ἐτέθαπτο ὑπὸ χθονὸς εὐρυοδείης· σῶμα γὰρ ἐν Κίρκης μεγάρῳ κατελείπομεν ἡμεῖς ἄκλαυτον καὶ ἄθαπτον, ἐπεὶ πόνος ἄλλος ἔπειγε.
 And she straightway came forth and opened the bright doors, and bade them in; and all went with her in their folly. Only Eurylochus remained behind, for he suspected that there was a snare. She brought them in and made them sit on chairs and seats, and made for them a potion of cheese and barley meal and yellow honey	τὸν μὲν ἐγὼ δάκρυσα ἰδὼν ἐλέησά τε θυμῷ, καί μιν φωνήσας ἔπεα πτερόεντα προσηύδων· Ἐλπῆνορ, πῶς ἦλθες ὑπὸ ζόφον ἠερόεντα; ἔφθης πεζὸς ἰὼν ἢ ἐγὼ σὺν νηὶ μελαίνῃ. ὣς ἐφάμην, ὁ δέ μʼ οἰμώξας ἠμείβετο μύθῳ·
 with Pramnian wine; but in the food she mixed baneful drugs, that they might utterly forget their native land. Now when she had given them the potion, and they had drunk it off, then she presently smote them with her wand, and penned them in the sties. And they had the heads, and voice, and bristles,	διογενὲς Λαερτιάδη, πολυμήχανʼ Ὀδυσσεῦ, ἆσέ με δαίμονος αἶσα κακὴ καὶ ἀθέσφατος οἶνος. Κίρκης δʼ ἐν μεγάρῳ καταλέγμενος οὐκ ἐνόησα ἄψορρον καταβῆναι ἰὼν ἐς κλίμακα μακρήν, ἀλλὰ καταντικρὺ τέγεος πέσον· ἐκ δέ μοι αὐχὴν
and shape of swine, but their minds remained unchanged even as before. So they were penned there weeping, and before them Circe flung mast and acorns, and the fruit of the cornel tree, to eat, such things as wallowing swine are wont to feed upon. “But Eurylochus came back straightway to the swift, black ship,	ἀστραγάλων ἐάγη, ψυχὴ δʼ Ἄϊδόσδε κατῆλθε. νῦν δέ σε τῶν ὄπιθεν γουνάζομαι, οὐ παρεόντων, πρός τʼ ἀλόχου καὶ πατρός, ὅ σʼ ἔτρεφε τυτθὸν ἐόντα, Τηλεμάχου θʼ, ὃν μοῦνον ἐνὶ μεγάροισιν ἔλειπες· οἶδα γὰρ ὡς ἐνθένδε κιὼν δόμου ἐξ Ἀίδαο
 to bring tiding of his comrades and their shameful doom. Not a word could he utter, for all his desire, so stricken to the heart was he with great distress, and his eyes were filled with tears, and his spirit was set on lamentation. But when we questioned him in amazement,	νῆσον ἐς Αἰαίην σχήσεις ἐυεργέα νῆα· ἔνθα σʼ ἔπειτα, ἄναξ, κέλομαι μνήσασθαι ἐμεῖο. μή μʼ ἄκλαυτον ἄθαπτον ἰὼν ὄπιθεν καταλείπειν νοσφισθείς, μή τοί τι θεῶν μήνιμα γένωμαι, ἀλλά με κακκῆαι σὺν τεύχεσιν, ἅσσα μοι ἔστιν,
then he told the fate of the others, his comrades. “‘We went through the thickets, as thou badest, noble Odysseus. We found in the forest glades a fair palace, built of polished stones, in a place of wide outlook. There someone was going to and fro before a great web, and singing with clear voice,	σῆμά τέ μοι χεῦαι πολιῆς ἐπὶ θινὶ θαλάσσης, ἀνδρὸς δυστήνοιο καὶ ἐσσομένοισι πυθέσθαι. ταῦτά τέ μοι τελέσαι πῆξαί τʼ ἐπὶ τύμβῳ ἐρετμόν, τῷ καὶ ζωὸς ἔρεσσον ἐὼν μετʼ ἐμοῖς ἑτάροισιν. ὣς ἔφατʼ, αὐτὰρ ἐγώ μιν ἀμειβόμενος προσέειπον·
 some goddess or some woman, and they cried aloud, and called to her. And she came forth straightway, and opened the bright doors, and bade them in; and they all went with her in their folly. But I remained behind, for I suspected that there was a snare. Then they all vanished together, nor did one of them	ταῦτά τοι, ὦ δύστηνε, τελευτήσω τε καὶ ἔρξω. νῶι μὲν ὣς ἐπέεσσιν ἀμειβομένω στυγεροῖσιν ἥμεθʼ, ἐγὼ μὲν ἄνευθεν ἐφʼ αἵματι φάσγανον ἴσχων, εἴδωλον δʼ ἑτέρωθεν ἑταίρου πόλλʼ ἀγόρευεν· ἦλθε δʼ ἐπὶ ψυχὴ μητρὸς κατατεθνηυίης,
appear again, though I sat long and watched.’ “So he spoke, and I cast my silver-studded sword about my shoulders, a great sword of bronze, and slung my bow about me, and bade him lead me back by the self-same road. But he clasped me with both hands, and be sought me by my knees,	Αὐτολύκου θυγάτηρ μεγαλήτορος Ἀντίκλεια, τὴν ζωὴν κατέλειπον ἰὼν εἰς Ἴλιον ἱρήν. τὴν μὲν ἐγὼ δάκρυσα ἰδὼν ἐλέησά τε θυμῷ· ἀλλʼ οὐδʼ ὣς εἴων προτέρην, πυκινόν περ ἀχεύων, αἵματος ἆσσον ἴμεν, πρὶν Τειρεσίαο πυθέσθαι.
and with wailing he spoke to me winged words: “‘Lead me not thither against my will, O thou fostered of Zeus, but leave me here. For I know that thou wilt neither come back thyself, nor bring anyone of thy comrades. Nay, with these that are here let us flee with all speed, for still we may haply escape the evil day.’	ἦλθε δʼ ἐπὶ ψυχὴ Θηβαίου Τειρεσίαο χρύσεον σκῆπτρον ἔχων, ἐμὲ δʼ ἔγνω καὶ προσέειπεν· διογενὲς Λαερτιάδη, πολυμήχανʼ Ὀδυσσεῦ, τίπτʼ αὖτʼ, ὦ δύστηνε, λιπὼν φάος ἠελίοιο ἤλυθες, ὄφρα ἴδῃ νέκυας καὶ ἀτερπέα χῶρον;
“So he spoke, but I answered him, and said:‘Eurylochus, do thou stay here in this place, eating and drinking by the hollow, black ship; but I will go, for strong necessity is laid upon me.’ “So saying, I went up from the ship and the sea.	ἀλλʼ ἀποχάζεο βόθρου, ἄπισχε δὲ φάσγανον ὀξύ, αἵματος ὄφρα πίω καί τοι νημερτέα εἴπω. ὣς φάτʼ, ἐγὼ δʼ ἀναχασσάμενος ξίφος ἀργυρόηλον κουλεῷ ἐγκατέπηξʼ. ὁ δʼ ἐπεὶ πίεν αἷμα κελαινόν, καὶ τότε δή μʼ ἐπέεσσι προσηύδα μάντις ἀμύμων·
 But when, as I went through the sacred glades, I was about to come to the great house of the sorceress, Circe, then Hermes, of the golden wand, met me as I went toward the house, in the likeness of a young man with the first down upon his lip, in whom the charm of youth is fairest.	νόστον δίζηαι μελιηδέα, φαίδιμʼ Ὀδυσσεῦ· τὸν δέ τοι ἀργαλέον θήσει θεός· οὐ γὰρ ὀίω λήσειν ἐννοσίγαιον, ὅ τοι κότον ἔνθετο θυμῷ χωόμενος ὅτι οἱ υἱὸν φίλον ἐξαλάωσας. ἀλλʼ ἔτι μέν κε καὶ ὣς κακά περ πάσχοντες ἵκοισθε,
He clasped my hand, and spoke, and addressed me: “‘Whither now again, hapless man, dost thou go alone through the hills, knowing naught of the country? Lo, thy comrades yonder in the house of Circe are penned like swine in close-barred sties. And art thou come to release them? Nay, I tell thee, thou shalt not	αἴ κʼ ἐθέλῃς σὸν θυμὸν ἐρυκακέειν καὶ ἑταίρων, ὁππότε κε πρῶτον πελάσῃς ἐυεργέα νῆα Θρινακίῃ νήσῳ, προφυγὼν ἰοειδέα πόντον, βοσκομένας δʼ εὕρητε βόας καὶ ἴφια μῆλα Ἠελίου, ὃς πάντʼ ἐφορᾷ καὶ πάντʼ ἐπακούει.
 thyself return, but shalt remain there with the others. But come, I will free thee from harm, and save thee. Here, take this potent herb, and go to the house of Circe, and it shall ward off from thy head the evil day. And I will tell thee all the baneful wiles of Circe.	τὰς εἰ μέν κʼ ἀσινέας ἐάᾳς νόστου τε μέδηαι, καί κεν ἔτʼ εἰς Ἰθάκην κακά περ πάσχοντες ἵκοισθε· εἰ δέ κε σίνηαι, τότε τοι τεκμαίρομʼ ὄλεθρον, νηί τε καὶ ἑτάροις. αὐτὸς δʼ εἴ πέρ κεν ἀλύξῃς, ὀψὲ κακῶς νεῖαι, ὀλέσας ἄπο πάντας ἑταίρους,
 She will mix thee a potion, and cast drugs into the food; but even so she shall not be able to bewitch thee, for the potent herb that I shall give thee will not suffer it. And I will tell thee all. When Circe shall smite thee with her long wand, then do thou draw thy sharp sword from beside thy thigh,	νηὸς ἐπʼ ἀλλοτρίης· δήεις δʼ ἐν πήματα οἴκῳ, ἄνδρας ὑπερφιάλους, οἵ τοι βίοτον κατέδουσι μνώμενοι ἀντιθέην ἄλοχον καὶ ἕδνα διδόντες. ἀλλʼ ἦ τοι κείνων γε βίας ἀποτίσεαι ἐλθών· αὐτὰρ ἐπὴν μνηστῆρας ἐνὶ μεγάροισι τεοῖσι
 and rush upon Circe, as though thou wouldst slay her. And she will be seized with fear, and will bid thee lie with her. Then do not thou thereafter refuse the couch of the goddess, that she may set free thy comrades, and give entertainment to thee. But bid her swear a great oath by the blessed gods,	κτείνῃς ἠὲ δόλῳ ἢ ἀμφαδὸν ὀξέι χαλκῷ, ἔρχεσθαι δὴ ἔπειτα λαβὼν ἐυῆρες ἐρετμόν, εἰς ὅ κε τοὺς ἀφίκηαι οἳ οὐκ ἴσασι θάλασσαν ἀνέρες, οὐδέ θʼ ἅλεσσι μεμιγμένον εἶδαρ ἔδουσιν· οὐδʼ ἄρα τοί γʼ ἴσασι νέας φοινικοπαρῄους
that she will not plot against thee any fresh mischief to thy hurt, lest when she has thee stripped she may render thee a weakling and unmanned.’ “So saying, Argeiphontes gave me the herb, drawing it from the ground, and showed me its nature. At the root it was black, but its flower was like milk.	οὐδʼ ἐυήρεʼ ἐρετμά, τά τε πτερὰ νηυσὶ πέλονται. σῆμα δέ τοι ἐρέω μάλʼ ἀριφραδές, οὐδέ σε λήσει· ὁππότε κεν δή τοι συμβλήμενος ἄλλος ὁδίτης φήῃ ἀθηρηλοιγὸν ἔχειν ἀνὰ φαιδίμῳ ὤμῳ, καὶ τότε δὴ γαίῃ πήξας ἐυῆρες ἐρετμόν,
Moly the gods call it, and it is hard for mortal men to dig; but with the gods all things are possible. Hermes then departed to high Olympus through the wooded isle, and I went my way to the house of Circe, and many things did my heart darkly ponder as I went.	ῥέξας ἱερὰ καλὰ Ποσειδάωνι ἄνακτι, ἀρνειὸν ταῦρόν τε συῶν τʼ ἐπιβήτορα κάπρον, οἴκαδʼ ἀποστείχειν ἔρδειν θʼ ἱερᾶς ἑκατόμβας ἀθανάτοισι θεοῖσι, τοὶ οὐρανὸν εὐρὺν ἔχουσι, πᾶσι μάλʼ ἑξείης. θάνατος δέ τοι ἐξ ἁλὸς αὐτῷ
 So I stood at the gates of the fair-tressed goddess. There I stood and called, and the goddess heard my voice. Straightway then she came forth, and opened the bright doors, and bade me in; and I went with her, my heart sore troubled. She brought me in and made me sit on a silver-studded chair,	ἀβληχρὸς μάλα τοῖος ἐλεύσεται, ὅς κέ σε πέφνῃ γήραι ὕπο λιπαρῷ ἀρημένον· ἀμφὶ δὲ λαοὶ ὄλβιοι ἔσσονται. τὰ δέ τοι νημερτέα εἴρω. ὣς ἔφατʼ, αὐτὰρ ἐγώ μιν ἀμειβόμενος προσέειπον· Τειρεσίη, τὰ μὲν ἄρ που ἐπέκλωσαν θεοὶ αὐτοί.
 a beautiful chair, richly wrought, and beneath was a foot-stool for the feet. And she prepared me a potion in a golden cup, that I might drink, and put therein a drug, with evil purpose in her heart. But when she had given it me, and I had drunk it off, yet was not bewitched, she smote me with her wand, and spoke, and addressed me:	ἀλλʼ ἄγε μοι τόδε εἰπὲ καὶ ἀτρεκέως κατάλεξον· μητρὸς τήνδʼ ὁρόω ψυχὴν κατατεθνηυίης· ἡ δʼ ἀκέουσʼ ἧσται σχεδὸν αἵματος, οὐδʼ ἑὸν υἱὸν ἔτλη ἐσάντα ἰδεῖν οὐδὲ προτιμυθήσασθαι. εἰπέ, ἄναξ, πῶς κέν με ἀναγνοίη τὸν ἐόντα;
‘Begone now to the sty, and lie with the rest of thy comrades.’ “So she spoke, but I, drawing my sharp sword from beside my thigh, rushed upon Circe, as though I would slay her. But she, with a loud cry, ran beneath, and clasped my knees, and with wailing she spoke to me winged words:	ὣς ἐφάμην, ὁ δέ μʼ αὐτίκʼ ἀμειβόμενος προσέειπεν· ῥηΐδιόν τοι ἔπος ἐρέω καὶ ἐπὶ φρεσὶ θήσω. ὅν τινα μέν κεν ἐᾷς νεκύων κατατεθνηώτων αἵματος ἆσσον ἴμεν, ὁ δέ τοι νημερτὲς ἐνίψει· ᾧ δέ κʼ ἐπιφθονέῃς, ὁ δέ τοι πάλιν εἶσιν ὀπίσσω.
 “‘Who art thou among men, and from whence? Where is thy city, and where thy parents? Amazement holds me that thou hast drunk this charm and wast in no wise bewitched. For no man else soever hath withstood this charm, when once he has drunk it, and it has passed the barrier of his teeth. Nay, but the mind in thy breast is one not to be beguiled.	ὣς φαμένη ψυχὴ μὲν ἔβη δόμον Ἄϊδος εἴσω Τειρεσίαο ἄνακτος, ἐπεὶ κατὰ θέσφατʼ ἔλεξεν· αὐτὰρ ἐγὼν αὐτοῦ μένον ἔμπεδον, ὄφρʼ ἐπὶ μήτηρ ἤλυθε καὶ πίεν αἷμα κελαινεφές· αὐτίκα δʼ ἔγνω, καί μʼ ὀλοφυρομένη ἔπεα πτερόεντα προσηύδα·
Surely thou art Odysseus, the man of ready device, who Argeiphontes of the golden wand ever said to me would come hither on his way home from Troy with his swift, black ship. Nay, come, put up thy sword in its sheath, and let us two then go up into my bed, that couched together	τέκνον ἐμόν, πῶς ἦλθες ὑπὸ ζόφον ἠερόεντα ζωὸς ἐών; χαλεπὸν δὲ τάδε ζωοῖσιν ὁρᾶσθαι. μέσσῳ γὰρ μεγάλοι ποταμοὶ καὶ δεινὰ ῥέεθρα, Ὠκεανὸς μὲν πρῶτα, τὸν οὔ πως ἔστι περῆσαι πεζὸν ἐόντʼ, ἢν μή τις ἔχῃ ἐυεργέα νῆα.
in love we may put trust in each other.’ “So she spoke, but I answered her, and said:‘Circe, how canst thou bid me be gentle to thee, who hast turned my comrades into swine in thy halls, and now keepest me here, and with guileful purpose biddest me	ἦ νῦν δὴ Τροίηθεν ἀλώμενος ἐνθάδʼ ἱκάνεις νηί τε καὶ ἑτάροισι πολὺν χρόνον; οὐδέ πω ἦλθες εἰς Ἰθάκην, οὐδʼ εἶδες ἐνὶ μεγάροισι γυναῖκα; ὣς ἔφατʼ, αὐτὰρ ἐγώ μιν ἀμειβόμενος προσέειπον· μῆτερ ἐμή, χρειώ με κατήγαγεν εἰς Ἀίδαο
go to thy chamber, and go up into thy bed, that when thou hast me stripped thou mayest render me a weakling and unmanned? Nay, verily, it is not I that shall be fain to go up into thy bed, unless thou, goddess, wilt consent to swear a mighty oath that thou wilt not plot against me any fresh mischief to my hurt.’	ψυχῇ χρησόμενον Θηβαίου Τειρεσίαο· οὐ γάρ πω σχεδὸν ἦλθον Ἀχαιΐδος, οὐδέ πω ἁμῆς γῆς ἐπέβην, ἀλλʼ αἰὲν ἔχων ἀλάλημαι ὀιζύν, ἐξ οὗ τὰ πρώτισθʼ ἑπόμην Ἀγαμέμνονι δίῳ Ἴλιον εἰς ἐύπωλον, ἵνα Τρώεσσι μαχοίμην.
“So I spoke, and she straightway swore the oath to do me no harm, as I bade her. But when she had sworn, and made an end of the oath, then I went up to the beautiful bed of Circe. “But her handmaids meanwhile were busied in the halls, four maidens who are her serving-women in the house.	ἀλλʼ ἄγε μοι τόδε εἰπὲ καὶ ἀτρεκέως κατάλεξον· τίς νύ σε κὴρ ἐδάμασσε τανηλεγέος θανάτοιο; ἦ δολιχὴ νοῦσος, ἦ Ἄρτεμις ἰοχέαιρα οἷς ἀγανοῖς βελέεσσιν ἐποιχομένη κατέπεφνεν; εἰπὲ δέ μοι πατρός τε καὶ υἱέος, ὃν κατέλειπον,
 Children are they of the springs and groves, and of the sacred rivers that flow forth to the sea, and of them one threw upon chairs fair rugs of purple above, and spread beneath them a linen cloth; another drew up before the chairs tables	ἢ ἔτι πὰρ κείνοισιν ἐμὸν γέρας, ἦέ τις ἤδη ἀνδρῶν ἄλλος ἔχει, ἐμὲ δʼ οὐκέτι φασὶ νέεσθαι. εἰπὲ δέ μοι μνηστῆς ἀλόχου βουλήν τε νόον τε, ἠὲ μένει παρὰ παιδὶ καὶ ἔμπεδα πάντα φυλάσσει ἦ ἤδη μιν ἔγημεν Ἀχαιῶν ὅς τις ἄριστος.
 But when the water boiled in the bright bronze, she set me in a bath, and bathed me with water from out the great cauldron, mixing it to my liking, and pouring it over my head and shoulders, till she took from my limbs soul-consuming weariness. But when she had bathed me, and anointed me richly with oil,	ὣς ἐφάμην, ἡ δʼ αὐτίκʼ ἀμείβετο πότνια μήτηρ· καὶ λίην κείνη γε μένει τετληότι θυμῷ σοῖσιν ἐνὶ μεγάροισιν· ὀιζυραὶ δέ οἱ αἰεὶ φθίνουσιν νύκτες τε καὶ ἤματα δάκρυ χεούσῃ. σὸν δʼ οὔ πώ τις ἔχει καλὸν γέρας, ἀλλὰ ἕκηλος
 and had cast about me a fair cloak and a tunic, she brought me into the hall, and made me sit upon a silver-studded chair—a beautiful chair, richly wrought, and beneath was a foot-stool for the feet. Then a handmaid brought water for the hands in a fair pitcher of gold, and poured it over a silver basin	Τηλέμαχος τεμένεα νέμεται καὶ δαῖτας ἐίσας δαίνυται, ἃς ἐπέοικε δικασπόλον ἄνδρʼ ἀλεγύνειν· πάντες γὰρ καλέουσι. πατὴρ δὲ σὸς αὐτόθι μίμνει ἀγρῷ, οὐδὲ πόλινδε κατέρχεται. οὐδέ οἱ εὐναὶ δέμνια καὶ χλαῖναι καὶ ῥήγεα σιγαλόεντα,
for me to wash, and beside me drew up a polished table. And the grave housewife brought and set before me bread, and therewith meats in abundance, granting freely of her store. Then she bade me eat, but my heart inclined not thereto. Rather, I sat with other thoughts, and my spirit boded ill.	ἀλλʼ ὅ γε χεῖμα μὲν εὕδει ὅθι δμῶες ἐνὶ οἴκῳ, ἐν κόνι ἄγχι πυρός, κακὰ δὲ χροῒ εἵματα εἷται· αὐτὰρ ἐπὴν ἔλθῃσι θέρος τεθαλυῖά τʼ ὀπώρη, πάντῃ οἱ κατὰ γουνὸν ἀλωῆς οἰνοπέδοιο φύλλων κεκλιμένων χθαμαλαὶ βεβλήαται εὐναί.
“Now when Circe noted that I sat thus, and did not put forth my hands to the food, but was burdened with sore grief, she came close to me, and spoke winged words: “‘Why, Odysseus, dost thou sit thus like one that is dumb, eating thy heart, and dost not touch food or drink?	ἔνθʼ ὅ γε κεῖτʼ ἀχέων, μέγα δὲ φρεσὶ πένθος ἀέξει σὸν νόστον ποθέων, χαλεπὸν δʼ ἐπὶ γῆρας ἱκάνει. οὕτω γὰρ καὶ ἐγὼν ὀλόμην καὶ πότμον ἐπέσπον· οὔτʼ ἐμέ γʼ ἐν μεγάροισιν ἐύσκοπος ἰοχέαιρα οἷς ἀγανοῖς βελέεσσιν ἐποιχομένη κατέπεφνεν,
Dost thou haply forbode some other guile? Nay, thou needest in no wise fear, for already have I sworn a mighty oath to do thee no harm.’ “So she spoke, but I answered her, and said:‘Circe, what man that is right-minded could bring himself to taste of food or drink,	οὔτε τις οὖν μοι νοῦσος ἐπήλυθεν, ἥ τε μάλιστα τηκεδόνι στυγερῇ μελέων ἐξείλετο θυμόν· ἀλλά με σός τε πόθος σά τε μήδεα, φαίδιμʼ Ὀδυσσεῦ, σή τʼ ἀγανοφροσύνη μελιηδέα θυμὸν ἀπηύρα. ὣς ἔφατʼ, αὐτὰρ ἐγώ γʼ ἔθελον φρεσὶ μερμηρίξας
ere yet he had won freedom for his comrades, and beheld them before his face? But if thou of a ready heart dost bid me eat and drink, set them free, that mine eyes may behold my trusty comrades.’ “So I spoke, and Circe went forth through the hall holding her wand in her hand, and opened the doors of the sty,	μητρὸς ἐμῆς ψυχὴν ἑλέειν κατατεθνηυίης. τρὶς μὲν ἐφωρμήθην, ἑλέειν τέ με θυμὸς ἀνώγει, τρὶς δέ μοι ἐκ χειρῶν σκιῇ εἴκελον ἢ καὶ ὀνείρῳ ἔπτατʼ. ἐμοὶ δʼ ἄχος ὀξὺ γενέσκετο κηρόθι μᾶλλον, καί μιν φωνήσας ἔπεα πτερόεντα προσηύδων·
 and drove them out in the form of swine of nine years old. So they stood there before her, and she went through the midst of them, and anointed each man with another charm. Then from their limbs the bristles fell away which the baneful drug that queenly Circe gave them had before made to grow,	μῆτερ ἐμή, τί νύ μʼ οὐ μίμνεις ἑλέειν μεμαῶτα, ὄφρα καὶ εἰν Ἀίδαο φίλας περὶ χεῖρε βαλόντε ἀμφοτέρω κρυεροῖο τεταρπώμεσθα γόοιο; ἦ τί μοι εἴδωλον τόδʼ ἀγαυὴ Περσεφόνεια ὤτρυνʼ, ὄφρʼ ἔτι μᾶλλον ὀδυρόμενος στεναχίζω;
and they became men again, younger than they were before, and far comelier and taller to look upon. They knew me, and clung to my hands, each man of them, and upon them all came a passionate sobbing, and the house about them rang wondrously, and the goddess herself was moved to pity.	ὣς ἐφάμην, ἡ δʼ αὐτίκʼ ἀμείβετο πότνια μήτηρ· ὤ μοι, τέκνον ἐμόν, περὶ πάντων κάμμορε φωτῶν, οὔ τί σε Περσεφόνεια Διὸς θυγάτηρ ἀπαφίσκει, ἀλλʼ αὕτη δίκη ἐστὶ βροτῶν, ὅτε τίς κε θάνῃσιν· οὐ γὰρ ἔτι σάρκας τε καὶ ὀστέα ἶνες ἔχουσιν,
 “Then the beautiful goddess drew near me, and said: ‘Son of Laertes, sprung from Zeus, Odysseus of many devices, go now to thy swift ship and to the shore of the sea. First of all do ye draw the ship up on the land, and store your goods and all the tackling in caves.	ἀλλὰ τὰ μέν τε πυρὸς κρατερὸν μένος αἰθομένοιο δαμνᾷ, ἐπεί κε πρῶτα λίπῃ λεύκʼ ὀστέα θυμός, ψυχὴ δʼ ἠύτʼ ὄνειρος ἀποπταμένη πεπότηται. ἀλλὰ φόωσδε τάχιστα λιλαίεο· ταῦτα δὲ πάντα ἴσθʼ, ἵνα καὶ μετόπισθε τεῇ εἴπῃσθα γυναικί.
 And as when calves in a farmstead sport about the droves of cows returning to the yard, when they have had their fill of grazing—all together they frisk before them, and the pens no longer hold them, but with constant lowing they run about their mothers—so those men, when their eyes beheld me,	νῶι μὲν ὣς ἐπέεσσιν ἀμειβόμεθʼ, αἱ δὲ γυναῖκες ἤλυθον, ὤτρυνεν γὰρ ἀγαυὴ Περσεφόνεια, ὅσσαι ἀριστήων ἄλοχοι ἔσαν ἠδὲ θύγατρες. αἱ δʼ ἀμφʼ αἷμα κελαινὸν ἀολλέες ἠγερέθοντο, αὐτὰρ ἐγὼ βούλευον ὅπως ἐρέοιμι ἑκάστην.
thronged about me weeping, and it seemed to their hearts as though they had got to their native land, and the very city of rugged Ithaca , where they were bred and born. And with wailing they spoke to me winged words: “‘At thy return, O thou fostered of Zeus, we are as glad	ἥδε δέ μοι κατὰ θυμὸν ἀρίστη φαίνετο βουλή· σπασσάμενος τανύηκες ἄορ παχέος παρὰ μηροῦ οὐκ εἴων πίνειν ἅμα πάσας αἷμα κελαινόν. αἱ δὲ προμνηστῖναι ἐπήισαν, ἠδὲ ἑκάστη ὃν γόνον ἐξαγόρευεν· ἐγὼ δʼ ἐρέεινον ἁπάσας.
as though we had returned to Ithaca , our native land. But come, tell the fate of the others, our comrades.’ “So they spoke, and I answered them with gentle words: ‘First of all let us draw the ship up on the land, and store our goods and all the tackling in caves.	ἔνθʼ ἦ τοι πρώτην Τυρὼ ἴδον εὐπατέρειαν, ἣ φάτο Σαλμωνῆος ἀμύμονος ἔκγονος εἶναι, φῆ δὲ Κρηθῆος γυνὴ ἔμμεναι Αἰολίδαο· ἣ ποταμοῦ ἠράσσατʼ Ἐνιπῆος θείοιο, ὃς πολὺ κάλλιστος ποταμῶν ἐπὶ γαῖαν ἵησι,
Then haste you, one and all, to go with me that you may see your comrades in the sacred halls of Circe, drinking and eating, for they have unfailing store.’ “So I spoke, and they quickly hearkened to my words. Eurylochus alone sought to hold back all my comrades,	καί ῥʼ ἐπʼ Ἐνιπῆος πωλέσκετο καλὰ ῥέεθρα. τῷ δʼ ἄρα εἰσάμενος γαιήοχος ἐννοσίγαιος ἐν προχοῇς ποταμοῦ παρελέξατο δινήεντος· πορφύρεον δʼ ἄρα κῦμα περιστάθη, οὔρεϊ ἶσον, κυρτωθέν, κρύψεν δὲ θεὸν θνητήν τε γυναῖκα.
and he spoke, and addressed them with winged words: “‘Ah, wretched men, whither are we going? Why are you so enamoured of these woes, as to go down to the house of Circe, who will change us all to swine, or wolves, or lions, that so we may guard her great house perforce?	λῦσε δὲ παρθενίην ζώνην, κατὰ δʼ ὕπνον ἔχευεν. αὐτὰρ ἐπεί ῥʼ ἐτέλεσσε θεὸς φιλοτήσια ἔργα, ἔν τʼ ἄρα οἱ φῦ χειρί, ἔπος τʼ ἔφατʼ ἔκ τʼ ὀνόμαζε· χαῖρε, γύναι, φιλότητι· περιπλομένου δʼ ἐνιαυτοῦ τέξεις ἀγλαὰ τέκνα, ἐπεὶ οὐκ ἀποφώλιοι εὐναὶ
Even so did the Cyclops , when our comrades went to his fold, and with them went this reckless Odysseus. For it was through this man's folly that they too perished.’ “So he spoke, and I pondered in heart, whether to draw my long sword from beside my stout thigh,	ἀθανάτων· σὺ δὲ τοὺς κομέειν ἀτιταλλέμεναί τε. νῦν δʼ ἔρχευ πρὸς δῶμα, καὶ ἴσχεο μηδʼ ὀνομήνῃς· αὐτὰρ ἐγώ τοί εἰμι Ποσειδάων ἐνοσίχθων. ὣς εἰπὼν ὑπὸ πόντον ἐδύσετο κυμαίνοντα. ἡ δʼ ὑποκυσαμένη Πελίην τέκε καὶ Νηλῆα,
and therewith strike off his head, and bring it to the ground, near kinsman of mine by marriage though he was; but my comrades one after another sought to check me with gentle words: “‘O thou sprung from Zeus, as for this man, we will leave him, if thou so biddest, to abide here by the ship, and to guard the ship,	τὼ κρατερὼ θεράποντε Διὸς μεγάλοιο γενέσθην ἀμφοτέρω· Πελίης μὲν ἐν εὐρυχόρῳ Ἰαωλκῷ ναῖε πολύρρηνος, ὁ δʼ ἄρʼ ἐν Πύλῳ ἠμαθόεντι. τοὺς δʼ ἑτέρους Κρηθῆι τέκεν βασίλεια γυναικῶν, Αἴσονά τʼ ἠδὲ Φέρητʼ Ἀμυθάονά θʼ ἱππιοχάρμην.
but as for us, do thou lead us to the sacred house of Circe.’ “So saying, they went up from the ship and the sea. Nor was Eurylochus left beside the hollow ship, but he went with us, for he feared my dread reproof. “Meanwhile in her halls Circe	τὴν δὲ μετʼ Ἀντιόπην ἴδον, Ἀσωποῖο θύγατρα, ἣ δὴ καὶ Διὸς εὔχετʼ ἐν ἀγκοίνῃσιν ἰαῦσαι, καί ῥʼ ἔτεκεν δύο παῖδʼ, Ἀμφίονά τε Ζῆθόν τε, οἳ πρῶτοι Θήβης ἕδος ἔκτισαν ἑπταπύλοιο, πύργωσάν τʼ, ἐπεὶ οὐ μὲν ἀπύργωτόν γʼ ἐδύναντο
 bathed the rest of my comrades with kindly care, and anointed them richly with oil, and cast about them fleecy cloaks and tunics; and we found them all feasting bountifully in the halls. But when they saw and recognized one another, face to face, they wept and wailed, and the house rang around.	ναιέμεν εὐρύχορον Θήβην, κρατερώ περ ἐόντε. τὴν δὲ μετʼ Ἀλκμήνην ἴδον, Ἀμφιτρύωνος ἄκοιτιν, ἥ ῥʼ Ἡρακλῆα θρασυμέμνονα θυμολέοντα γείνατʼ ἐν ἀγκοίνῃσι Διὸς μεγάλοιο μιγεῖσα· καὶ Μεγάρην, Κρείοντος ὑπερθύμοιο θύγατρα,

but I went up to the beautiful bed of Circe, and besought her by her knees; and the goddess heard my voice, and I spoke, and addressed her with winged words: “‘Circe, fulfil for me the promise which thou gavest to send me home; for my spirit is now eager to be gone,	ὁσσάκι γὰρ κύψειʼ ὁ γέρων πιέειν μενεαίνων, τοσσάχʼ ὕδωρ ἀπολέσκετʼ ἀναβροχέν, ἀμφὶ δὲ ποσσὶ γαῖα μέλαινα φάνεσκε, καταζήνασκε δὲ δαίμων. δένδρεα δʼ ὑψιπέτηλα κατὰ κρῆθεν χέε καρπόν, ὄγχναι καὶ ῥοιαὶ καὶ μηλέαι ἀγλαόκαρποι συκέαι τε γλυκεραὶ καὶ ἐλαῖαι τηλεθόωσαι· τῶν ὁπότʼ ἰθύσειʼ ὁ γέρων ἐπὶ χερσὶ μάσασθαι, τὰς δʼ ἄνεμος ῥίπτασκε ποτὶ νέφεα σκιόεντα. καὶ μὴν Σίσυφον εἰσεῖδον κρατέρʼ ἄλγεʼ ἔχοντα λᾶαν βαστάζοντα πελώριον ἀμφοτέρῃσιν. ἦ τοι ὁ μὲν σκηριπτόμενος χερσίν τε ποσίν τε λᾶαν ἄνω ὤθεσκε ποτὶ λόφον· ἀλλʼ ὅτε μέλλοι ἄκρον ὑπερβαλέειν, τότʼ ἀποστρέψασκε κραταιίς· αὖτις ἔπειτα πέδονδε κυλίνδετο λᾶας ἀναιδής. αὐτὰρ ὅ γʼ ἂψ ὤσασκε τιταινόμενος, κατὰ δʼ ἱδρὼς ἔρρεεν ἐκ μελέων, κονίη δʼ ἐκ κρατὸς ὀρώρει. τὸν δὲ μετʼ εἰσενόησα βίην Ἡρακληείην, εἴδωλον· αὐτὸς δὲ μετʼ ἀθανάτοισι θεοῖσι τέρπεται ἐν θαλίῃς καὶ ἔχει καλλίσφυρον Ἥβην, παῖδα Διὸς μεγάλοιο καὶ Ἥρης χρυσοπεδίλου. ἀμφὶ δέ μιν κλαγγὴ νεκύων ἦν οἰωνῶν ὥς, πάντοσʼ ἀτυζομένων· ὁ δʼ ἐρεμνῇ νυκτὶ ἐοικώς, γυμνὸν τόξον ἔχων καὶ ἐπὶ νευρῆφιν ὀιστόν, δεινὸν παπταίνων, αἰεὶ βαλέοντι ἐοικώς. σμερδαλέος δέ οἱ ἀμφὶ περὶ στήθεσσιν ἀορτὴρ χρύσεος ἦν τελαμών, ἵνα θέσκελα ἔργα τέτυκτο, ἄρκτοι τʼ ἀγρότεροί τε σύες χαροποί τε λέοντες, ὑσμῖναί τε μάχαι τε φόνοι τʼ ἀνδροκτασίαι τε. μὴ τεχνησάμενος μηδʼ ἄλλο τι τεχνήσαιτο, ὃς κεῖνον τελαμῶνα ἑῇ ἐγκάτθετο τέχνῃ. ἔγνω δʼ αὖτʼ ἔμʼ ἐκεῖνος, ἐπεὶ ἴδεν ὀφθαλμοῖσιν, καί μʼ ὀλοφυρόμενος ἔπεα πτερόεντα προσηύδα· διογενὲς Λαερτιάδη, πολυμήχανʼ Ὀδυσσεῦ, ἆ δείλʼ, ἦ τινὰ καὶ σὺ κακὸν μόρον ἡγηλάζεις, ὅν περ ἐγὼν ὀχέεσκον ὑπʼ αὐγὰς ἠελίοιο.

that he alone should have understanding; but the others flit about as shadows.’ “So she spoke, and my spirit was broken within me, and I wept as I sat on the bed, nor had my heart any longer desire to live and behold the light of the sun. But when I had my fill of weeping and writhing,	αὐτὰρ ἐπεὶ ποταμοῖο λίπεν ῥόον Ὠκεανοῖο νηῦς, ἀπὸ δʼ ἵκετο κῦμα θαλάσσης εὐρυπόροιο νῆσόν τʼ Αἰαίην, ὅθι τʼ Ἠοῦς ἠριγενείης οἰκία καὶ χοροί εἰσι καὶ ἀντολαὶ Ἠελίοιο,
then I made answer, and addressed her, saying: “‘O Circe, who will guide us on this journey? To Hades no man ever yet went in a black ship.’ “So I spoke, and the beautiful goddess straightway made answer: ‘Son of Laertes, sprung from Zeus, Odysseus of many devices,	νῆα μὲν ἔνθʼ ἐλθόντες ἐκέλσαμεν ἐν ψαμάθοισιν, ἐκ δὲ καὶ αὐτοὶ βῆμεν ἐπὶ ῥηγμῖνι θαλάσσης· ἔνθα δʼ ἀποβρίξαντες ἐμείναμεν Ἠῶ δῖαν. ἦμος δʼ ἠριγένεια φάνη ῥοδοδάκτυλος Ἠώς, δὴ τότʼ ἐγὼν ἑτάρους προΐειν ἐς δώματα Κίρκης
let there be in thy mind no concern for a pilot to guide thy ship, but set up thy mast, and spread the white sail, and sit thee down; and the breath of the North Wind will bear her onward. But when in thy ship thou hast now crossed the stream of Oceanus, where is a level shore and the groves of Persephone—	οἰσέμεναι νεκρόν, Ἐλπήνορα τεθνηῶτα. φιτροὺς δʼ αἶψα ταμόντες, ὅθʼ ἀκροτάτη πρόεχʼ ἀκτή, θάπτομεν ἀχνύμενοι θαλερὸν κατὰ δάκρυ χέοντες. αὐτὰρ ἐπεὶ νεκρός τʼ ἐκάη καὶ τεύχεα νεκροῦ, τύμβον χεύαντες καὶ ἐπὶ στήλην ἐρύσαντες
tall poplars, and willows that shed their fruit—there do thou beach thy ship by the deep eddying Oceanus, but go thyself to the dank house of Hades. There into Acheron flow Periphlegethon and Cocytus, which is a branch of the water of the Styx;	πήξαμεν ἀκροτάτῳ τύμβῳ ἐυῆρες ἐρετμόν. ἡμεῖς μὲν τὰ ἕκαστα διείπομεν· οὐδʼ ἄρα Κίρκην ἐξ Ἀίδεω ἐλθόντες ἐλήθομεν, ἀλλὰ μάλʼ ὦκα ἦλθʼ ἐντυναμένη· ἅμα δʼ ἀμφίπολοι φέρον αὐτῇ σῖτον καὶ κρέα πολλὰ καὶ αἴθοπα οἶνον ἐρυθρόν.
 and there is a rock, and the meeting place of the two roaring rivers. Thither, prince, do thou draw nigh, as I bid thee, and dig a pit of a cubit's length this way and that, and around it pour a libation to all the dead, first with milk and honey, thereafter with sweet wine,	ἡ δʼ ἐν μέσσῳ στᾶσα μετηύδα δῖα θεάων· σχέτλιοι, οἳ ζώοντες ὑπήλθετε δῶμʼ Ἀίδαο, δισθανέες, ὅτε τʼ ἄλλοι ἅπαξ θνῄσκουσʼ ἄνθρωποι. ἀλλʼ ἄγετʼ ἐσθίετε βρώμην καὶ πίνετε οἶνον αὖθι πανημέριοι· ἅμα δʼ ἠοῖ φαινομένηφι
and in the third place with water, and sprinkle thereon white barley meal. And do thou earnestly entreat the powerless heads of the dead, vowing that when thou comest to Ithaca thou wilt sacrifice in thy halls a barren heifer, the best thou hast, and wilt fill the altar with rich gifts; and that to Teiresias alone thou wilt sacrifice separately a ram,	πλεύσεσθʼ· αὐτὰρ ἐγὼ δείξω ὁδὸν ἠδὲ ἕκαστα σημανέω, ἵνα μή τι κακορραφίῃ ἀλεγεινῇ ἢ ἁλὸς ἢ ἐπὶ γῆς ἀλγήσετε πῆμα παθόντες. ὣς ἔφαθʼ, ἡμῖν δʼ αὖτʼ ἐπεπείθετο θυμὸς ἀγήνωρ. ὣς τότε μὲν πρόπαν ἦμαρ ἐς ἠέλιον καταδύντα
 wholly black, the goodliest of thy flock. But when with prayers thou hast made supplication to the glorious tribes of the dead, then sacrifice a ram and a black ewe, turning their heads toward Erebus but thyself turning backward, and setting thy face towards the streams of the river. Then many	ἥμεθα δαινύμενοι κρέα τʼ ἄσπετα καὶ μέθυ ἡδύ· ἦμος δʼ ἠέλιος κατέδυ καὶ ἐπὶ κνέφας ἦλθεν, οἱ μὲν κοιμήσαντο παρὰ πρυμνήσια νηός, ἡ δʼ ἐμὲ χειρὸς ἑλοῦσα φίλων ἀπονόσφιν ἑταίρων εἷσέ τε καὶ προσέλεκτο καὶ ἐξερέεινεν ἕκαστα·
 ghosts of men that are dead will come forth. But do thou thereafter call to thy comrades, and bid them flay and burn the sheep that lie there, slain by the pitiless bronze, and make prayer to the gods, to mighty Hades and to dread Persephone.	αὐτὰρ ἐγὼ τῇ πάντα κατὰ μοῖραν κατέλεξα. καὶ τότε δή μʼ ἐπέεσσι προσηύδα πότνια Κίρκη· ταῦτα μὲν οὕτω πάντα πεπείρανται, σὺ δʼ ἄκουσον, ὥς τοι ἐγὼν ἐρέω, μνήσει δέ σε καὶ θεὸς αὐτός. Σειρῆνας μὲν πρῶτον ἀφίξεαι, αἵ ῥά τε πάντας
 And do thou thyself draw thy sharp sword from beside thy thigh, and sit there, not suffering the powerless heads of the dead to draw near to the blood, till thou hast enquired of Teiresias. Then the seer will presently come to thee, leader of men, and he will tell thee thy way and the measures of thy path,	ἀνθρώπους θέλγουσιν, ὅτις σφεας εἰσαφίκηται. ὅς τις ἀιδρείῃ πελάσῃ καὶ φθόγγον ἀκούσῃ Σειρήνων, τῷ δʼ οὔ τι γυνὴ καὶ νήπια τέκνα οἴκαδε νοστήσαντι παρίσταται οὐδὲ γάνυνται, ἀλλά τε Σειρῆνες λιγυρῇ θέλγουσιν ἀοιδῇ
and of thy return, how thou mayest go over the teeming deep.’ “So she spoke, and straightway came golden-throned Dawn. Round about me then she cast a cloak and tunic as raiment, and the nymph clothed herself in a long white robe, finely-woven and beautiful, and about her waist she cast	ἥμεναι ἐν λειμῶνι, πολὺς δʼ ἀμφʼ ὀστεόφιν θὶς ἀνδρῶν πυθομένων, περὶ δὲ ῥινοὶ μινύθουσι. ἀλλὰ παρεξελάαν, ἐπὶ δʼ οὔατʼ ἀλεῖψαι ἑταίρων κηρὸν δεψήσας μελιηδέα, μή τις ἀκούσῃ τῶν ἄλλων· ἀτὰρ αὐτὸς ἀκουέμεν αἴ κʼ ἐθέλῃσθα,
a fair girdle of gold, and upon her head she put a veil. But I went through the halls, and roused my men with gentle words, coming up to each man in turn. “‘No longer now sleep ye, and drowse in sweet slumber, but let us go; lo! queenly Circe has told me all.’	δησάντων σʼ ἐν νηὶ θοῇ χεῖράς τε πόδας τε ὀρθὸν ἐν ἱστοπέδῃ, ἐκ δʼ αὐτοῦ πείρατʼ ἀνήφθω, ὄφρα κε τερπόμενος ὄπʼ ἀκούσῃς Σειρήνοιιν. εἰ δέ κε λίσσηαι ἑτάρους λῦσαί τε κελεύῃς, οἱ δέ σʼ ἔτι πλεόνεσσι τότʼ ἐν δεσμοῖσι διδέντων.
 “So I spoke, and their proud hearts consented. But not even from thence could I lead my men unscathed. There was one, Elpenor, the youngest of all, not over valiant in war nor sound of understanding, who had laid him down apart from his comrades in the sacred house of Circe,	αὐτὰρ ἐπὴν δὴ τάς γε παρὲξ ἐλάσωσιν ἑταῖροι, ἔνθα τοι οὐκέτʼ ἔπειτα διηνεκέως ἀγορεύσω, ὁπποτέρη δή τοι ὁδὸς ἔσσεται, ἀλλὰ καὶ αὐτὸς θυμῷ βουλεύειν· ἐρέω δέ τοι ἀμφοτέρωθεν. ἔνθεν μὲν γὰρ πέτραι ἐπηρεφέες, προτὶ δʼ αὐτὰς
 seeking the cool air, for he was heavy with wine. He heard the noise and the bustle of his comrades as they moved about, and suddenly sprang up, and forgot to go to the long ladder that he might come down again, but fell headlong from the roof, and his neck	κῦμα μέγα ῥοχθεῖ κυανώπιδος Ἀμφιτρίτης· Πλαγκτὰς δή τοι τάς γε θεοὶ μάκαρες καλέουσι. τῇ μέν τʼ οὐδὲ ποτητὰ παρέρχεται οὐδὲ πέλειαι τρήρωνες, ταί τʼ ἀμβροσίην Διὶ πατρὶ φέρουσιν, ἀλλά τε καὶ τῶν αἰὲν ἀφαιρεῖται λὶς πέτρη·
was broken away from the spine, and his spirit went down to the house of Hades. “But as my men were going on their way I spoke among them, saying: ‘Ye think, forsooth, that ye are going to your dear native land; but Circe has pointed out for us another journey, even to the house of Hades and dread Persephone,	ἀλλʼ ἄλλην ἐνίησι πατὴρ ἐναρίθμιον εἶναι. τῇ δʼ οὔ πώ τις νηῦς φύγεν ἀνδρῶν, ἥ τις ἵκηται, ἀλλά θʼ ὁμοῦ πίνακάς τε νεῶν καὶ σώματα φωτῶν κύμαθʼ ἁλὸς φορέουσι πυρός τʼ ὀλοοῖο θύελλαι. οἴη δὴ κείνη γε παρέπλω ποντοπόρος νηῦς,
to consult the spirit of Theban Teiresias.’ “So I spoke, and their spirit was broken within them, and sitting down right where they were, they wept and tore their hair. But no good came of their lamenting. “But when we were on our way to the swift ship and the shore of the sea,	Ἀργὼ πᾶσι μέλουσα, παρʼ Αἰήταο πλέουσα. καὶ νύ κε τὴν ἔνθʼ ὦκα βάλεν μεγάλας ποτὶ πέτρας, ἀλλʼ Ἥρη παρέπεμψεν, ἐπεὶ φίλος ἦεν Ἰήσων. οἱ δὲ δύω σκόπελοι ὁ μὲν οὐρανὸν εὐρὺν ἱκάνει ὀξείῃ κορυφῇ, νεφέλη δέ μιν ἀμφιβέβηκε
 sorrowing and shedding big tears, meanwhile Circe had gone forth and made fast beside the black ship a ram and a black ewe, for easily had she passed us by. Who with his eyes could behold a god against his will, whether going to or fro?	κυανέη· τὸ μὲν οὔ ποτʼ ἐρωεῖ, οὐδέ ποτʼ αἴθρη κείνου ἔχει κορυφὴν οὔτʼ ἐν θέρει οὔτʼ ἐν ὀπώρῃ. οὐδέ κεν ἀμβαίη βροτὸς ἀνὴρ οὐδʼ ἐπιβαίη, οὐδʼ εἴ οἱ χεῖρές τε ἐείκοσι καὶ πόδες εἶεν· πέτρη γὰρ λίς ἐστι, περιξεστῇ ἐικυῖα.
 “But when we had come down to the ship and to the sea, first of all we drew the ship down to the bright sea, and set the mast and sail in the black ship, and took the sheep and put them aboard,	ἔνθα δʼ ἐνὶ Σκύλλη ναίει δεινὸν λελακυῖα. τῆς ἦ τοι φωνὴ μὲν ὅση σκύλακος νεογιλῆς γίγνεται, αὐτὴ δʼ αὖτε πέλωρ κακόν· οὐδέ κέ τίς μιν γηθήσειεν ἰδών, οὐδʼ εἰ θεὸς ἀντιάσειεν. τῆς ἦ τοι πόδες εἰσὶ δυώδεκα πάντες ἄωροι,
 and ourselves embarked, sorrowing, and shedding big tears. And for our aid in the wake of our dark-prowed ship a fair wind that filled the sail, a goodly comrade, was sent by fair-tressed Circe, dread goddess of human speech. So when we had made fast all the tackling throughout the ship,	ἓξ δέ τέ οἱ δειραὶ περιμήκεες, ἐν δὲ ἑκάστῃ σμερδαλέη κεφαλή, ἐν δὲ τρίστοιχοι ὀδόντες πυκνοὶ καὶ θαμέες, πλεῖοι μέλανος θανάτοιο. μέσση μέν τε κατὰ σπείους κοίλοιο δέδυκεν, ἔξω δʼ ἐξίσχει κεφαλὰς δεινοῖο βερέθρου,
we sat down, and the wind and the helms man made straight her course. All the day long her sail was stretched as she sped over the sea; and the sun set and all the ways grew dark. “She came to deep-flowing Oceanus, that bounds the Earth, where is the land and city of the Cimmerians,	αὐτοῦ δʼ ἰχθυάᾳ, σκόπελον περιμαιμώωσα, δελφῖνάς τε κύνας τε, καὶ εἴ ποθι μεῖζον ἕλῃσι κῆτος, ἃ μυρία βόσκει ἀγάστονος Ἀμφιτρίτη. τῇ δʼ οὔ πώ ποτε ναῦται ἀκήριοι εὐχετόωνται παρφυγέειν σὺν νηί· φέρει δέ τε κρατὶ ἑκάστῳ
 wrapped in mist and cloud. Never does the bright sun look down on them with his rays either when he mounts the starry heaven or when he turns again to earth from heaven, but baneful night is spread over wretched mortals.	φῶτʼ ἐξαρπάξασα νεὸς κυανοπρῴροιο. τὸν δʼ ἕτερον σκόπελον χθαμαλώτερον ὄψει, Ὀδυσσεῦ. πλησίον ἀλλήλων· καί κεν διοϊστεύσειας. τῷ δʼ ἐν ἐρινεὸς ἔστι μέγας, φύλλοισι τεθηλώς· τῷ δʼ ὑπὸ δῖα Χάρυβδις ἀναρροιβδεῖ μέλαν ὕδωρ.
Thither we came and beached our ship, and took out the sheep, and ourselves went beside the stream of Oceanus until we came to the place of which Circe had told us. “Here Perimedes and Eurylochus held the victims, while I drew my sharp sword from beside my thigh,	τρὶς μὲν γάρ τʼ ἀνίησιν ἐπʼ ἤματι, τρὶς δʼ ἀναροιβδεῖ δεινόν· μὴ σύ γε κεῖθι τύχοις, ὅτε ῥοιβδήσειεν· οὐ γάρ κεν ῥύσαιτό σʼ ὑπὲκ κακοῦ οὐδʼ ἐνοσίχθων. ἀλλὰ μάλα Σκύλλης σκοπέλῳ πεπλημένος ὦκα νῆα παρὲξ ἐλάαν, ἐπεὶ ἦ πολὺ φέρτερόν ἐστιν
 and dug a pit of a cubit's length this way and that, and around it poured a libation to all the dead, first with milk and honey, thereafter with sweet wine, and in the third place with water, and I sprinkled thereon white barley meal. And I earnestly entreated the powerless heads of the dead,	ἓξ ἑτάρους ἐν νηὶ ποθήμεναι ἢ ἅμα πάντας. ὣς ἔφατʼ, αὐτὰρ ἐγώ μιν ἀμειβόμενος προσέειπον· εἰ δʼ ἄγε δή μοι τοῦτο, θεά, νημερτὲς ἐνίσπες, εἴ πως τὴν ὀλοὴν μὲν ὑπεκπροφύγοιμι Χάρυβδιν, τὴν δέ κʼ ἀμυναίμην, ὅτε μοι σίνοιτό γʼ ἑταίρους.
vowing that when I came to Ithaca I would sacrifice in my halls a barren heifer, the best I had, and pile the altar with goodly gifts, and to Teiresias alone would sacrifice separately a ram, wholly black, the goodliest of my flocks. But when with vows and prayers	ὣς ἐφάμην, ἡ δʼ αὐτίκʼ ἀμείβετο δῖα θεάων· σχέτλιε, καὶ δὴ αὖ τοι πολεμήια ἔργα μέμηλε καὶ πόνος· οὐδὲ θεοῖσιν ὑπείξεαι ἀθανάτοισιν; ἡ δέ τοι οὐ θνητή, ἀλλʼ ἀθάνατον κακόν ἐστι, δεινόν τʼ ἀργαλέον τε καὶ ἄγριον οὐδὲ μαχητόν·
 I had made supplication to the tribes of the dead, I took the sheep and cut their throats over the pit, and the dark blood ran forth. Then there gathered from out of Erebus the spirits of those that are dead, brides, and unwedded youths, and toil-worn old men, and tender maidens with hearts yet new to sorrow,	οὐδέ τις ἔστʼ ἀλκή· φυγέειν κάρτιστον ἀπʼ αὐτῆς. ἢν γὰρ δηθύνῃσθα κορυσσόμενος παρὰ πέτρῃ, δείδω, μή σʼ ἐξαῦτις ἐφορμηθεῖσα κίχῃσι τόσσῃσιν κεφαλῇσι, τόσους δʼ ἐκ φῶτας ἕληται. ἀλλὰ μάλα σφοδρῶς ἐλάαν, βωστρεῖν δὲ Κράταιιν,
 and many, too, that had been wounded with bronze-tipped spears, men slain in fight, wearing their blood-stained armour. These came thronging in crowds about the pit from every side, with a wondrous cry; and pale fear seized me. Then I called to my comrades and bade them flay and burn	μητέρα τῆς Σκύλλης, ἥ μιν τέκε πῆμα βροτοῖσιν· ἥ μιν ἔπειτʼ ἀποπαύσει ἐς ὕστερον ὁρμηθῆναι. Θρινακίην δʼ ἐς νῆσον ἀφίξεαι· ἔνθα δὲ πολλαὶ βόσκοντʼ Ἠελίοιο βόες καὶ ἴφια μῆλα, ἑπτὰ βοῶν ἀγέλαι, τόσα δʼ οἰῶν πώεα καλά,
 the sheep that lay there slain with the pitiless bronze, and to make prayer to the gods, to mighty Hades and dread Persephone. And I myself drew my sharp sword from beside my thigh and sat there, and would not suffer the powerless heads of the dead	πεντήκοντα δʼ ἕκαστα. γόνος δʼ οὐ γίγνεται αὐτῶν, οὐδέ ποτε φθινύθουσι. θεαὶ δʼ ἐπιποιμένες εἰσίν, νύμφαι ἐυπλόκαμοι, Φαέθουσά τε Λαμπετίη τε, ἃς τέκεν Ἠελίῳ Ὑπερίονι δῖα Νέαιρα. τὰς μὲν ἄρα θρέψασα τεκοῦσά τε πότνια μήτηρ
to draw near to the blood until I had enquired of Teiresias. “The first to come was the spirit of my comrade Elpenor. Not yet had he been buried beneath the broad-wayed earth, for we had left his corpse behind us in the hall of Circe, unwept and unburied, since another task was then urging us on.	Θρινακίην ἐς νῆσον ἀπῴκισε τηλόθι ναίειν, μῆλα φυλασσέμεναι πατρώια καὶ ἕλικας βοῦς. τὰς εἰ μέν κʼ ἀσινέας ἐάᾳς νόστου τε μέδηαι, ἦ τʼ ἂν ἔτʼ εἰς Ἰθάκην κακά περ πάσχοντες ἵκοισθε· εἰ δέ κε σίνηαι, τότε τοι τεκμαίρομʼ ὄλεθρον,
When I saw him I wept, and my heart had compassion on him; and I spoke and addressed him with winged words: “‘Elpenor, how didst thou come beneath the murky darkness? Thou coming on foot hast out-stripped me in my black ship.’ “So I spoke, and with a groan he answered me and said:	νηί τε καὶ ἑτάροις· αὐτὸς δʼ εἴ πέρ κεν ἀλύξῃς, ὀψὲ κακῶς νεῖαι, ὀλέσας ἄπο πάντας ἑταίρους. ὣς ἔφατʼ, αὐτίκα δὲ χρυσόθρονος ἤλυθεν Ἠώς. ἡ μὲν ἔπειτʼ ἀνὰ νῆσον ἀπέστιχε δῖα θεάων· αὐτὰρ ἐγὼν ἐπὶ νῆα κιὼν ὤτρυνον ἑταίρους
 ‘Son of Laertes, sprung from Zeus, Odysseus of many devices, an evil doom of some god was my undoing, and measureless wine. When I had lain down to sleep in the house of Circe I did not think to go to the long ladder that I might come down again, but fell headlong from the roof, and my neck	αὐτούς τʼ ἀμβαίνειν ἀνά τε πρυμνήσια λῦσαι· οἱ δʼ αἶψʼ εἴσβαινον καὶ ἐπὶ κληῖσι καθῖζον. ἑξῆς δʼ ἑζόμενοι πολιὴν ἅλα τύπτον ἐρετμοῖς. ἡμῖν δʼ αὖ κατόπισθε νεὸς κυανοπρῴροιο ἴκμενον οὖρον ἵει πλησίστιον, ἐσθλὸν ἑταῖρον,
 was broken away from the spine and my spirit went down to the house of Hades. Now I beseech thee by those whom we left behind, who are not present with us, by thy wife and thy father who reared thee when a babe, and by Telemachus whom thou didst leave an only son in thy halls; for I know that as thou goest hence from the house of Hades	Κίρκη ἐυπλόκαμος, δεινὴ θεὸς αὐδήεσσα. αὐτίκα δʼ ὅπλα ἕκαστα πονησάμενοι κατὰ νῆα ἥμεθα· τὴν δʼ ἄνεμός τε κυβερνήτης τʼ ἴθυνε. δὴ τότʼ ἐγὼν ἑτάροισι μετηύδων ἀχνύμενος κῆρ· ὦ φίλοι, οὐ γὰρ χρὴ ἕνα ἴδμεναι οὐδὲ δύʼ οἴους
 thou wilt touch at the Aeaean isle with thy well-built ship. There, then, O prince, I bid thee remember me. Leave me not behind thee unwept and unburied as thou goest thence, and turn not away from me, lest haply I bring the wrath of the gods upon thee. Nay, burn me with my armour, all that is mine,	θέσφαθʼ ἅ μοι Κίρκη μυθήσατο, δῖα θεάων· ἀλλʼ ἐρέω μὲν ἐγών, ἵνα εἰδότες ἤ κε θάνωμεν ἤ κεν ἀλευάμενοι θάνατον καὶ κῆρα φύγοιμεν. Σειρήνων μὲν πρῶτον ἀνώγει θεσπεσιάων φθόγγον ἀλεύασθαι καὶ λειμῶνʼ ἀνθεμόεντα.
and heap up a mound for me on the shore of the grey sea, in memory of an unhappy man, that men yet to be may learn of me. Fulfil this my prayer, and fix upon the mound my oar wherewith I rowed in life when I was among my comrades.’ “So he spoke, and I made answer and said:	οἶον ἔμʼ ἠνώγει ὄπʼ ἀκουέμεν· ἀλλά με δεσμῷ δήσατʼ ἐν ἀργαλέῳ, ὄφρʼ ἔμπεδον αὐτόθι μίμνω, ὀρθὸν ἐν ἱστοπέδῃ, ἐκ δʼ αὐτοῦ πείρατʼ ἀνήφθω. εἰ δέ κε λίσσωμαι ὑμέας λῦσαί τε κελεύω, ὑμεῖς δὲ πλεόνεσσι τότʼ ἐν δεσμοῖσι πιέζειν.
‘All this, unhappy man, will I perform and do.’ “Thus we two sat and held sad converse one with the other, I on one side holding my sword over the blood, while on the other side the phantom of my comrade spoke at large. “Then there came up the spirit of my dead mother,	ἦ τοι ἐγὼ τὰ ἕκαστα λέγων ἑτάροισι πίφαυσκον· τόφρα δὲ καρπαλίμως ἐξίκετο νηῦς ἐυεργὴς νῆσον Σειρήνοιιν· ἔπειγε γὰρ οὖρος ἀπήμων. αὐτίκʼ ἔπειτʼ ἄνεμος μὲν ἐπαύσατο ἠδὲ γαλήνη ἔπλετο νηνεμίη, κοίμησε δὲ κύματα δαίμων.
Anticleia, the daughter of great-hearted Autolycus, whom I had left alive when I departed for sacred Ilios . At sight of her I wept, and my heart had compassion on her, but even so I would not suffer her to come near the blood, for all my great sorrow, until I had enquired of Teiresias.	ἀνστάντες δʼ ἕταροι νεὸς ἱστία μηρύσαντο καὶ τὰ μὲν ἐν νηὶ γλαφυρῇ θέσαν, οἱ δʼ ἐπʼ ἐρετμὰ ἑζόμενοι λεύκαινον ὕδωρ ξεστῇς ἐλάτῃσιν. αὐτὰρ ἐγὼ κηροῖο μέγαν τροχὸν ὀξέι χαλκῷ τυτθὰ διατμήξας χερσὶ στιβαρῇσι πίεζον·
 “Then there came up the spirit of the Theban Teiresias, bearing his golden staff in his hand, and he knew me and spoke to me: ‘Son of Laertes, sprung from Zeus, Odysseus of many devices, what now, hapless man? Why hast thou left the light of the sun and come hither to behold the dead and a region where is no joy?	αἶψα δʼ ἰαίνετο κηρός, ἐπεὶ κέλετο μεγάλη ἲς Ἠελίου τʼ αὐγὴ Ὑπεριονίδαο ἄνακτος· ἑξείης δʼ ἑτάροισιν ἐπʼ οὔατα πᾶσιν ἄλειψα. οἱ δʼ ἐν νηί μʼ ἔδησαν ὁμοῦ χεῖράς τε πόδας τε ὀρθὸν ἐν ἱστοπέδῃ, ἐκ δʼ αὐτοῦ πείρατʼ ἀνῆπτον·
Nay, give place from the pit and draw back thy sharp sword, that I may drink of the blood and tell thee sooth.’ “So he spoke, and I gave place and thrust my silver-studded sword into its sheath, and when he had drunk the dark blood, then the blameless seer spoke to me and said:	αὐτοὶ δʼ ἑζόμενοι πολιὴν ἅλα τύπτον ἐρετμοῖς. ἀλλʼ ὅτε τόσσον ἀπῆμεν ὅσον τε γέγωνε βοήσας, ῥίμφα διώκοντες, τὰς δʼ οὐ λάθεν ὠκύαλος νηῦς ἐγγύθεν ὀρνυμένη, λιγυρὴν δʼ ἔντυνον ἀοιδήν· δεῦρʼ ἄγʼ ἰών, πολύαινʼ Ὀδυσεῦ, μέγα κῦδος Ἀχαιῶν,
 “‘Thou askest of thy honey-sweet return, glorious Odysseus, but this shall a god make grievous unto thee; for I think not that thou shalt elude the Earth-shaker, seeing that he has laid up wrath in his heart against thee, angered that thou didst blind his dear son. Yet even so ye may reach home, though in evil plight,	νῆα κατάστησον, ἵνα νωιτέρην ὄπ ἀκούσῃς. οὐ γάρ πώ τις τῇδε παρήλασε νηὶ μελαίνῃ, πρίν γʼ ἡμέων μελίγηρυν ἀπὸ στομάτων ὄπʼ ἀκοῦσαι, ἀλλʼ ὅ γε τερψάμενος νεῖται καὶ πλείονα εἰδώς. ἴδμεν γάρ τοι πάνθʼ ὅσʼ ἐνὶ Τροίῃ εὐρείῃ
 if thou wilt curb thine own spirit and that of thy comrades, as soon as thou shalt bring thy well-built ship to the island Thrinacia, escaping from the violet sea, and ye find grazing there the kine and goodly flocks of Helios, who over sees and overhears all things.	Ἀργεῖοι Τρῶές τε θεῶν ἰότητι μόγησαν, ἴδμεν δʼ, ὅσσα γένηται ἐπὶ χθονὶ πουλυβοτείρῃ. ὣς φάσαν ἱεῖσαι ὄπα κάλλιμον· αὐτὰρ ἐμὸν κῆρ ἤθελʼ ἀκουέμεναι, λῦσαί τʼ ἐκέλευον ἑταίρους ὀφρύσι νευστάζων· οἱ δὲ προπεσόντες ἔρεσσον.
If thou leavest these unharmed and heedest thy homeward way, verily ye may yet reach Ithaca , though in evil plight. But if thou harmest them, then I foresee ruin for thy ship and thy comrades, and even if thou shalt thyself escape, late shalt thou come home and in evil case, after losing all thy comrades,	αὐτίκα δʼ ἀνστάντες Περιμήδης Εὐρύλοχός τε πλείοσί μʼ ἐν δεσμοῖσι δέον μᾶλλόν τε πίεζον. αὐτὰρ ἐπεὶ δὴ τάς γε παρήλασαν, οὐδʼ ἔτʼ ἔπειτα φθογγῆς Σειρήνων ἠκούομεν οὐδέ τʼ ἀοιδῆς, αἶψʼ ἀπὸ κηρὸν ἕλοντο ἐμοὶ ἐρίηρες ἑταῖροι,
 in a ship that is another's, and thou shalt find woes in thy house—proud men that devour thy livelihood, wooing thy godlike wife, and offering wooers' gifts. Yet verily on their violent deeds shalt thou take vengeance when thou comest. But when thou hast slain the wooers in thy halls,	ὅν σφιν ἐπʼ ὠσὶν ἄλειψʼ, ἐμέ τʼ ἐκ δεσμῶν ἀνέλυσαν. ἀλλʼ ὅτε δὴ τὴν νῆσον ἐλείπομεν, αὐτίκʼ ἔπειτα καπνὸν καὶ μέγα κῦμα ἴδον καὶ δοῦπον ἄκουσα. τῶν δʼ ἄρα δεισάντων ἐκ χειρῶν ἔπτατʼ ἐρετμά, βόμβησαν δʼ ἄρα πάντα κατὰ ῥόον· ἔσχετο δʼ αὐτοῦ
 whether by guile or openly with the sharp sword, then do thou go forth, taking a shapely oar, until thou comest to men that know naught of the sea and eat not of food mingled with salt, aye, and they know naught of ships with purple cheeks,	νηῦς, ἐπεὶ οὐκέτʼ ἐρετμὰ προήκεα χερσὶν ἔπειγον. αὐτὰρ ἐγὼ διὰ νηὸς ἰὼν ὤτρυνον ἑταίρους μειλιχίοις ἐπέεσσι παρασταδὸν ἄνδρα ἕκαστον· ὦ φίλοι, οὐ γάρ πώ τι κακῶν ἀδαήμονές εἰμεν· οὐ μὲν δὴ τόδε μεῖζον ἕπει κακόν, ἢ ὅτε Κύκλωψ
 or of shapely oars that are as wings unto ships. And I will tell thee a sign right manifest, which will not escape thee. When another wayfarer, on meeting thee, shall say that thou hast a winnowing-fan on thy stout shoulder, then do thou fix in the earth thy shapely oar	εἴλει ἐνὶ σπῆι γλαφυρῷ κρατερῆφι βίηφιν· ἀλλὰ καὶ ἔνθεν ἐμῇ ἀρετῇ, βουλῇ τε νόῳ τε, ἐκφύγομεν, καί που τῶνδε μνήσεσθαι ὀίω. νῦν δʼ ἄγεθʼ, ὡς ἂν ἐγὼ εἴπω, πειθώμεθα πάντες. ὑμεῖς μὲν κώπῃσιν ἁλὸς ῥηγμῖνα βαθεῖαν
and make goodly offerings to lord Poseidon—a ram, and a bull, and a boar that mates with sows—and depart for thy home and offer sacred hecatombs to the immortal gods who hold broad heaven, to each one in due order. And death shall come to thee thyself far from the sea,	τύπτετε κληίδεσσιν ἐφήμενοι, αἴ κέ ποθι Ζεὺς δώῃ τόνδε γʼ ὄλεθρον ὑπεκφυγέειν καὶ ἀλύξαι· σοὶ δέ, κυβερνῆθʼ, ὧδʼ ἐπιτέλλομαι· ἀλλʼ ἐνὶ θυμῷ βάλλευ, ἐπεὶ νηὸς γλαφυρῆς οἰήια νωμᾷς. τούτου μὲν καπνοῦ καὶ κύματος ἐκτὸς ἔεργε
a death so gentle, that shall lay thee low when thou art overcome with sleek old age, and thy people shall dwell in prosperity around thee. In this have I told thee sooth.’ “So he spoke, and I made answer and said: ‘Teiresias, of all this, I ween, the gods themselves have spun the thread.	νῆα, σὺ δὲ σκοπέλου ἐπιμαίεο, μή σε λάθῃσι κεῖσʼ ἐξορμήσασα καὶ ἐς κακὸν ἄμμε βάλῃσθα. ὣς ἐφάμην, οἱ δʼ ὦκα ἐμοῖς ἐπέεσσι πίθοντο. Σκύλλην δʼ οὐκέτʼ ἐμυθεόμην, ἄπρηκτον ἀνίην, μή πώς μοι δείσαντες ἀπολλήξειαν ἑταῖροι
But come, tell me this, and declare it truly. I see here the spirit of my dead mother; she sits in silence near the blood, and deigns not to look upon the face of her own son or to speak to him. Tell me, prince, how she may recognize that I am he?’	εἰρεσίης, ἐντὸς δὲ πυκάζοιεν σφέας αὐτούς. καὶ τότε δὴ Κίρκης μὲν ἐφημοσύνης ἀλεγεινῆς λανθανόμην, ἐπεὶ οὔ τί μʼ ἀνώγει θωρήσσεσθαι· αὐτὰρ ἐγὼ καταδὺς κλυτὰ τεύχεα καὶ δύο δοῦρε μάκρʼ ἐν χερσὶν ἑλὼν εἰς ἴκρια νηὸς ἔβαινον
“So I spoke, and he straightway made answer, and said: ‘Easy is the word that I shall say and put in thy mind. Whomsoever of those that are dead and gone thou shalt suffer to draw near the blood, he will tell thee sooth; but whomsoever thou refusest, he surely will go back again.’	πρῴρης· ἔνθεν γάρ μιν ἐδέγμην πρῶτα φανεῖσθαι Σκύλλην πετραίην, ἥ μοι φέρε πῆμʼ ἑτάροισιν. οὐδέ πῃ ἀθρῆσαι δυνάμην, ἔκαμον δέ μοι ὄσσε πάντῃ παπταίνοντι πρὸς ἠεροειδέα πέτρην. ἡμεῖς μὲν στεινωπὸν ἀνεπλέομεν γοόωντες·
“So saying the spirit of the prince, Teiresias, went back into the house of Hades, when he had declared his prophecies; but I remained there steadfastly until my mother came up and drank the dark blood. At once then she knew me, and with wailing she spoke to me winged words:	ἔνθεν μὲν Σκύλλη, ἑτέρωθι δὲ δῖα Χάρυβδις δεινὸν ἀνερροίβδησε θαλάσσης ἁλμυρὸν ὕδωρ. ἦ τοι ὅτʼ ἐξεμέσειε, λέβης ὣς ἐν πυρὶ πολλῷ πᾶσʼ ἀναμορμύρεσκε κυκωμένη, ὑψόσε δʼ ἄχνη ἄκροισι σκοπέλοισιν ἐπʼ ἀμφοτέροισιν ἔπιπτεν·
 “‘My child, how didst thou come beneath the murky darkness, being still alive? Hard is it for those that live to behold these realms, for between are great rivers and dread streams; Oceanus first, which one may in no wise cross on foot, but only if one have a well-built ship.	ἀλλʼ ὅτʼ ἀναβρόξειε θαλάσσης ἁλμυρὸν ὕδωρ, πᾶσʼ ἔντοσθε φάνεσκε κυκωμένη, ἀμφὶ δὲ πέτρη δεινὸν ἐβεβρύχει, ὑπένερθε δὲ γαῖα φάνεσκε ψάμμῳ κυανέη· τοὺς δὲ χλωρὸν δέος ᾕρει. ἡμεῖς μὲν πρὸς τὴν ἴδομεν δείσαντες ὄλεθρον·
Art thou but now come hither from Troy after long wanderings with thy ship and thy companions? and hast thou not yet reached Ithaca , nor seen thy wife in thy halls?’ “So she spoke, and I made answer and said: ‘My mother, necessity brought me down to the house of Hades,	τόφρα δέ μοι Σκύλλη γλαφυρῆς ἐκ νηὸς ἑταίρους ἓξ ἕλεθʼ, οἳ χερσίν τε βίηφί τε φέρτατοι ἦσαν. σκεψάμενος δʼ ἐς νῆα θοὴν ἅμα καὶ μεθʼ ἑταίρους ἤδη τῶν ἐνόησα πόδας καὶ χεῖρας ὕπερθεν ὑψόσʼ ἀειρομένων· ἐμὲ δὲ φθέγγοντο καλεῦντες
to seek soothsaying of the spirit of Theban Teiresias. For not yet have I come near to the shore of Achaea , nor have I as yet set foot on my own land, but have ever been wandering, laden with woe, from the day when first I went with goodly Agamemnon to Ilios , famed for its horses, to fight with the Trojans.	ἐξονομακλήδην, τότε γʼ ὕστατον, ἀχνύμενοι κῆρ. ὡς δʼ ὅτʼ ἐπὶ προβόλῳ ἁλιεὺς περιμήκεϊ ῥάβδῳ ἰχθύσι τοῖς ὀλίγοισι δόλον κατὰ εἴδατα βάλλων ἐς πόντον προΐησι βοὸς κέρας ἀγραύλοιο, ἀσπαίροντα δʼ ἔπειτα λαβὼν ἔρριψε θύραζε,
 But come, tell me this, and declare it truly. What fate of grievous death overcame thee? Was it long disease, or did the archer, Artemis, assail thee with her gentle shafts, and slay thee? And tell me of my father and my son, whom I left behind me.	ὣς οἵ γʼ ἀσπαίροντες ἀείροντο προτὶ πέτρας· αὐτοῦ δʼ εἰνὶ θύρῃσι κατήσθιε κεκληγῶτας χεῖρας ἐμοὶ ὀρέγοντας ἐν αἰνῇ δηιοτῆτι· οἴκτιστον δὴ κεῖνο ἐμοῖς ἴδον ὀφθαλμοῖσι πάντων, ὅσσʼ ἐμόγησα πόρους ἁλὸς ἐξερεείνων.
Does the honor that was mine still abide with them, or does some other man now possess it, and do they say that I shall no more return? And tell me of my wedded wife, of her purpose and of her mind. Does she abide with her son, and keep all things safe? or has one already wedded her, whosoever is best of the Achaeans?’	αὐτὰρ ἐπεὶ πέτρας φύγομεν δεινήν τε Χάρυβδιν Σκύλλην τʼ, αὐτίκʼ ἔπειτα θεοῦ ἐς ἀμύμονα νῆσον ἱκόμεθʼ· ἔνθα δʼ ἔσαν καλαὶ βόες εὐρυμέτωποι, πολλὰ δὲ ἴφια μῆλʼ Ὑπερίονος Ἠελίοιο. δὴ τότʼ ἐγὼν ἔτι πόντῳ ἐὼν ἐν νηὶ μελαίνῃ
 “So I spoke, and my honored mother straightway answered: ‘Aye verily she abides with steadfast heart in thy halls, and ever sorrowfully for her do the nights and the days wane, as she weeps. But the fair honor that was thine no man yet possesses,	μυκηθμοῦ τʼ ἤκουσα βοῶν αὐλιζομενάων οἰῶν τε βληχήν· καί μοι ἔπος ἔμπεσε θυμῷ μάντηος ἀλαοῦ, Θηβαίου Τειρεσίαο, Κίρκης τʼ Αἰαίης, ἥ μοι μάλα πόλλʼ ἐπέτελλε νῆσον ἀλεύασθαι τερψιμβρότου Ἠελίοιο.
 but Telemachus holds thy demesne unharassed, and feasts a equal banquets, such as it is fitting that one who deals judgment should share, for all men invite him. But thy father abides there in the tilled land, and comes not to the city, nor has he, for bedding, bed and cloaks and bright coverlets,	δὴ τότʼ ἐγὼν ἑτάροισι μετηύδων ἀχνύμενος κῆρ· κέκλυτέ μευ μύθων κακά περ πάσχοντες ἑταῖροι, ὄφρʼ ὑμῖν εἴπω μαντήια Τειρεσίαο Κίρκης τʼ Αἰαίης, ἥ μοι μάλα πόλλʼ ἐπέτελλε νῆσον ἀλεύασθαι τερψιμβρότου Ἠελίοιο·
 but through the winter he sleeps in the house, where the slaves sleep, in the ashes by the fire, and wears upon his body mean raiment. But when summer comes and rich autumn, then all about the slope of his vineyard plot are strewn his lowly beds of fallen leaves.	ἔνθα γὰρ αἰνότατον κακὸν ἔμμεναι ἄμμιν ἔφασκεν. ἀλλὰ παρὲξ τὴν νῆσον ἐλαύνετε νῆα μέλαιναν. ὣς ἐφάμην, τοῖσιν δὲ κατεκλάσθη φίλον ἦτορ. αὐτίκα δʼ Εὐρύλοχος στυγερῷ μʼ ἠμείβετο μύθῳ· σχέτλιός εἰς, Ὀδυσεῦ· περί τοι μένος, οὐδέ τι γυῖα
 There he lies sorrowing, and nurses his great grief in his heart, in longing for thy return, and heavy old age has come upon him. Even so did I too perish and meet my fate. Neither did the keen-sighted archer goddess assail me in my halls with her gentle shafts, and slay me,	κάμνεις· ἦ ῥά νυ σοί γε σιδήρεα πάντα τέτυκται, ὅς ῥʼ ἑτάρους καμάτῳ ἁδηκότας ἠδὲ καὶ ὕπνῳ οὐκ ἐάᾳς γαίης ἐπιβήμεναι, ἔνθα κεν αὖτε νήσῳ ἐν ἀμφιρύτῃ λαρὸν τετυκοίμεθα δόρπον, ἀλλʼ αὔτως διὰ νύκτα θοὴν ἀλάλησθαι ἄνωγας
nor did any disease come upon me, such as oftenest through grievous wasting takes the spirit from the limbs; nay, it was longing for thee, and for thy counsels, glorious Odysseus, and for thy tender-heartedness, that robbed me of honey-sweet life.’ “So she spoke, and I pondered in heart, and was fain	νήσου ἀποπλαγχθέντας ἐν ἠεροειδέι πόντῳ. ἐκ νυκτῶν δʼ ἄνεμοι χαλεποί, δηλήματα νηῶν, γίγνονται· πῇ κέν τις ὑπεκφύγοι αἰπὺν ὄλεθρον, ἤν πως ἐξαπίνης ἔλθῃ ἀνέμοιο θύελλα, ἢ Νότου ἢ Ζεφύροιο δυσαέος, οἵ τε μάλιστα
to clasp the spirit of my dead mother. Thrice I sprang towards her, and my heart bade me clasp her, and thrice she flitted from my arms like a shadow or a dream, and pain grew ever sharper at my heart. And I spoke and addressed her with winged words:	νῆα διαρραίουσι θεῶν ἀέκητι ἀνάκτων. ἀλλʼ ἦ τοι νῦν μὲν πειθώμεθα νυκτὶ μελαίνῃ δόρπον θʼ ὁπλισόμεσθα θοῇ παρὰ νηὶ μένοντες, ἠῶθεν δʼ ἀναβάντες ἐνήσομεν εὐρέι πόντῳ. ὣς ἔφατʼ Εὐρύλοχος, ἐπὶ δʼ ᾔνεον ἄλλοι ἑταῖροι.
“‘My mother, why dost thou not stay for me, who am eager to clasp thee, that even in the house of Hades we two may cast our arms each about the other, and take our fill of chill lamenting. Is this but a phantom that august Persephone has sent me, that I may lament and groan the more?’	καὶ τότε δὴ γίγνωσκον ὃ δὴ κακὰ μήδετο δαίμων, καί μιν φωνήσας ἔπεα πτερόεντα προσηύδων· Εὐρύλοχʼ, ἦ μάλα δή με βιάζετε μοῦνον ἐόντα. ἀλλʼ ἄγε νῦν μοι πάντες ὀμόσσατε καρτερὸν ὅρκον· εἴ κέ τινʼ ἠὲ βοῶν ἀγέλην ἢ πῶυ μέγʼ οἰῶν
 “So I spoke, and my honored mother straightway answered: ‘Ah me, my child, ill-fated above all men, in no wise does Persephone, the daughter of Zeus, deceive thee, but this is the appointed way with mortals when one dies. For the sinews no longer hold the flesh and the bones together,	εὕρωμεν, μή πού τις ἀτασθαλίῃσι κακῇσιν ἢ βοῦν ἠέ τι μῆλον ἀποκτάνῃ· ἀλλὰ ἕκηλοι ἐσθίετε βρώμην, τὴν ἀθανάτη πόρε Κίρκη. ὣς ἐφάμην, οἱ δʼ αὐτίκʼ ἀπώμνυον, ὡς ἐκέλευον. αὐτὰρ ἐπεί ῥʼ ὄμοσάν τε τελεύτησάν τε τὸν ὅρκον,
but the strong might of blazing fire destroys these, as soon as the life leaves the white bones, and the spirit, like a dream, flits away, and hovers to and fro. But haste thee to the light with what speed thou mayest, and bear all these things in mind, that thou mayest hereafter tell them to thy wife.’	στήσαμεν ἐν λιμένι γλαφυρῷ ἐυεργέα νῆα ἄγχʼ ὕδατος γλυκεροῖο, καὶ ἐξαπέβησαν ἑταῖροι νηός, ἔπειτα δὲ δόρπον ἐπισταμένως τετύκοντο. αὐτὰρ ἐπεὶ πόσιος καὶ ἐδητύος ἐξ ἔρον ἕντο, μνησάμενοι δὴ ἔπειτα φίλους ἔκλαιον ἑταίρους,
 “Thus we two talked with one another; and the women came, for august Persephone sent them forth, even all those that had been the wives and the daughters of chieftains. These flocked in throngs about the dark blood, and I considered how I might question each;	οὓς ἔφαγε Σκύλλη γλαφυρῆς ἐκ νηὸς ἑλοῦσα· κλαιόντεσσι δὲ τοῖσιν ἐπήλυθε νήδυμος ὕπνος. ἦμος δὲ τρίχα νυκτὸς ἔην, μετὰ δʼ ἄστρα βεβήκει, ὦρσεν ἔπι ζαῆν ἄνεμον νεφεληγερέτα Ζεὺς λαίλαπι θεσπεσίῃ, σὺν δὲ νεφέεσσι κάλυψε
and this seemed to my mind the best counsel. I drew my long sword from beside my stout thigh, and would not suffer them to drink of the dark blood all at one time. So they drew near, one after the other, and each declared her birth, and I questioned them all.	γαῖαν ὁμοῦ καὶ πόντον· ὀρώρει δʼ οὐρανόθεν νύξ. ἦμος δʼ ἠριγένεια φάνη ῥοδοδάκτυλος Ἠώς, νῆα μὲν ὡρμίσαμεν κοῖλον σπέος εἰσερύσαντες. ἔνθα δʼ ἔσαν νυμφέων καλοὶ χοροὶ ἠδὲ θόωκοι· καὶ τότʼ ἐγὼν ἀγορὴν θέμενος μετὰ μῦθον ἔειπον·
 “Then verily the first that I saw was high-born Tyro, who said that she was the daughter of noble Salmoneus, and declared herself to be the wife of Cretheus, son of Aeolus. She became enamoured of the river, divine Enipeus, who is far the fairest of rivers that send forth their streams upon the earth,	ὦ φίλοι, ἐν γὰρ νηὶ θοῇ βρῶσίς τε πόσις τε ἔστιν, τῶν δὲ βοῶν ἀπεχώμεθα, μή τι πάθωμεν· δεινοῦ γὰρ θεοῦ αἵδε βόες καὶ ἴφια μῆλα, Ἠελίου, ὃς πάντʼ ἐφορᾷ καὶ πάντʼ ἐπακούει. ὣς ἐφάμην, τοῖσιν δʼ ἐπεπείθετο θυμὸς ἀγήνωρ.
 and she was wont to resort to the fair waters of Enipeus. But the Enfolder and Shaker of the earth took his form, and lay with her at the mouths of the eddying river. And the dark wave stood about them like a mountain, vaulted-over, and hid the god and the mortal woman.	μῆνα δὲ πάντʼ ἄλληκτος ἄη Νότος, οὐδέ τις ἄλλος γίγνετʼ ἔπειτʼ ἀνέμων εἰ μὴ Εὖρός τε Νότος τε. οἱ δʼ ἧος μὲν σῖτον ἔχον καὶ οἶνον ἐρυθρόν, τόφρα βοῶν ἀπέχοντο λιλαιόμενοι βιότοιο. ἀλλʼ ὅτε δὴ νηὸς ἐξέφθιτο ἤια πάντα,
And he loosed her maiden girdle, and shed sleep upon her. But when the god had ended his work of love, he clasped her hand, and spoke, and addressed her: “‘Be glad, woman, in our love, and as the year goes on its course thou shalt bear glorious children, for not weak are the embraces	καὶ δὴ ἄγρην ἐφέπεσκον ἀλητεύοντες ἀνάγκῃ, ἰχθῦς ὄρνιθάς τε, φίλας ὅ τι χεῖρας ἵκοιτο, γναμπτοῖς ἀγκίστροισιν, ἔτειρε δὲ γαστέρα λιμός· δὴ τότʼ ἐγὼν ἀνὰ νῆσον ἀπέστιχον, ὄφρα θεοῖσιν εὐξαίμην, εἴ τίς μοι ὁδὸν φήνειε νέεσθαι.
of a god. These do thou tend and rear. But now go to thy house, and hold thy peace, and tell no man; but know that I am Poseidon, the shaker of the earth.’ “So saying, he plunged beneath the surging sea. But she conceived and bore Pelias and Neleus,	ἀλλʼ ὅτε δὴ διὰ νήσου ἰὼν ἤλυξα ἑταίρους, χεῖρας νιψάμενος, ὅθʼ ἐπὶ σκέπας ἦν ἀνέμοιο, ἠρώμην πάντεσσι θεοῖς οἳ Ὄλυμπον ἔχουσιν· οἱ δʼ ἄρα μοι γλυκὺν ὕπνον ἐπὶ βλεφάροισιν ἔχευαν. Εὐρύλοχος δʼ ἑτάροισι κακῆς ἐξήρχετο βουλῆς·
who both became strong servants of great Zeus; and Pelias dwelt in spacious Iolcus, and was rich in flocks, and the other dwelt in sandy Pylos . But her other children she, the queenly among women, bore to Cretheus, even Aeson, and Pheres, and Amythaon, who fought from chariots.	κέκλυτέ μευ μύθων κακά περ πάσχοντες ἑταῖροι. πάντες μὲν στυγεροὶ θάνατοι δειλοῖσι βροτοῖσι, λιμῷ δʼ οἴκτιστον θανέειν καὶ πότμον ἐπισπεῖν. ἀλλʼ ἄγετʼ, Ἠελίοιο βοῶν ἐλάσαντες ἀρίστας ῥέξομεν ἀθανάτοισι, τοὶ οὐρανὸν εὐρὺν ἔχουσιν.
 “And after her I saw Antiope, daughter of Asopus, who boasted that she had slept even in the arms of Zeus, and she bore two sons, Amphion and Zethus, who first established the seat of seven-gated Thebe, and fenced it in with walls, for they could not	εἰ δέ κεν εἰς Ἰθάκην ἀφικοίμεθα, πατρίδα γαῖαν, αἶψά κεν Ἠελίῳ Ὑπερίονι πίονα νηὸν τεύξομεν, ἐν δέ κε θεῖμεν ἀγάλματα πολλὰ καὶ ἐσθλά. εἰ δὲ χολωσάμενός τι βοῶν ὀρθοκραιράων νῆʼ ἐθέλῃ ὀλέσαι, ἐπὶ δʼ ἕσπωνται θεοὶ ἄλλοι,
dwell in spacious Thebe unfenced, how mighty soever they were. “And after her I saw Alcmene, wife of Amphitryon, who lay in the arms of great Zeus, and bore Heracles, staunch in fight, the lion-hearted. And Megara I saw, daughter of Creon, high-of-heart,	βούλομʼ ἅπαξ πρὸς κῦμα χανὼν ἀπὸ θυμὸν ὀλέσσαι, ἢ δηθὰ στρεύγεσθαι ἐὼν ἐν νήσῳ ἐρήμῃ. ὣς ἔφατʼ Εὐρύλοχος, ἐπὶ δʼ ᾔνεον ἄλλοι ἑταῖροι. αὐτίκα δʼ Ἠελίοιο βοῶν ἐλάσαντες ἀρίστας ἐγγύθεν, οὐ γὰρ τῆλε νεὸς κυανοπρῴροιο
whom the son of Amphitryon, ever stubborn in might, had to wife. “And I saw the mother of Oedipodes, fair Epicaste, who wrought a monstrous deed in ignorance of mind, in that she wedded her own son, and he, when he had slain his own father, wedded her, and straightway the gods made these things known among men.	βοσκέσκονθʼ ἕλικες καλαὶ βόες εὐρυμέτωποι· τὰς δὲ περίστησάν τε καὶ εὐχετόωντο θεοῖσιν, φύλλα δρεψάμενοι τέρενα δρυὸς ὑψικόμοιο· οὐ γὰρ ἔχον κρῖ λευκὸν ἐυσσέλμου ἐπὶ νηός. αὐτὰρ ἐπεί ῥʼ εὔξαντο καὶ ἔσφαξαν καὶ ἔδειραν,
 Howbeit he abode as lord of the Cadmeans in lovely Thebe, suffering woes through the baneful counsels of the gods, but she went down to the house of Hades, the strong warder. She made fast a noose on high from a lofty beam, overpowered by her sorrow, but for him she left behind woes	μηρούς τʼ ἐξέταμον κατά τε κνίσῃ ἐκάλυψαν δίπτυχα ποιήσαντες, ἐπʼ αὐτῶν δʼ ὠμοθέτησαν. οὐδʼ εἶχον μέθυ λεῖψαι ἐπʼ αἰθομένοις ἱεροῖσιν, ἀλλʼ ὕδατι σπένδοντες ἐπώπτων ἔγκατα πάντα. αὐτὰρ ἐπεὶ κατὰ μῆρʼ ἐκάη καὶ σπλάγχνα πάσαντο,
full many, even all that the Avengers of a mother bring to pass. “And I saw beauteous Chloris, whom once Neleus wedded because of her beauty, when he had brought countless gifts of wooing. Youngest daughter was she of Amphion, son of Iasus, who once ruled mightily in Orchomenus of the Minyae.	μίστυλλόν τʼ ἄρα τἆλλα καὶ ἀμφʼ ὀβελοῖσιν ἔπειραν. καὶ τότε μοι βλεφάρων ἐξέσσυτο νήδυμος ὕπνος, βῆν δʼ ἰέναι ἐπὶ νῆα θοὴν καὶ θῖνα θαλάσσης. ἀλλʼ ὅτε δὴ σχεδὸν ἦα κιὼν νεὸς ἀμφιελίσσης, καὶ τότε με κνίσης ἀμφήλυθεν ἡδὺς ἀυτμή.
And she was queen of Pylos , and bore to her husband glorious children, Nestor, and Chromius, and lordly Periclymenus, and besides these she bore noble Pero , a wonder to men. Her all that dwelt about sought in marriage, but Neleus would give her to no man, save to him who	οἰμώξας δὲ θεοῖσι μέγʼ ἀθανάτοισι γεγώνευν· Ζεῦ πάτερ ἠδʼ ἄλλοι μάκαρες θεοὶ αἰὲν ἐόντες, ἦ με μάλʼ εἰς ἄτην κοιμήσατε νηλέι ὕπνῳ. οἱ δʼ ἕταροι μέγα ἔργον ἐμητίσαντο μένοντες. ὠκέα δʼ Ἠελίῳ Ὑπερίονι ἄγγελος ἦλθε
should drive from Phylace the kine of mighty Iphicles, sleek and broad of brow; and hard they were to drive. These the blameless seer alone undertook to drive off; but a grievous fate of the gods ensnared him, even hard bonds and the herdsmen of the field.	Λαμπετίη τανύπεπλος, ὅ οἱ βόας ἔκταμεν ἡμεῖς. αὐτίκα δʼ ἀθανάτοισι μετηύδα χωόμενος κῆρ· Ζεῦ πάτερ ἠδʼ ἄλλοι μάκαρες θεοὶ αἰὲν ἐόντες, τῖσαι δὴ ἑτάρους Λαερτιάδεω Ὀδυσῆος, οἵ μευ βοῦς ἔκτειναν ὑπέρβιον, ᾗσιν ἐγώ γε
Howbeit when at length the months and the days were being brought to fulfillment, as the year rolled round, and the seasons came on, then verily mighty Iphicles released him, when he had told all the oracles; and the will of Zeus was fulfilled. “And I saw Lede , the wife of Tyndareus, who bore to Tyndareus two sons, stout of heart,	χαίρεσκον μὲν ἰὼν εἰς οὐρανὸν ἀστερόεντα, ἠδʼ ὁπότʼ ἂψ ἐπὶ γαῖαν ἀπʼ οὐρανόθεν προτραποίμην. εἰ δέ μοι οὐ τίσουσι βοῶν ἐπιεικέʼ ἀμοιβήν, δύσομαι εἰς Ἀίδαο καὶ ἐν νεκύεσσι φαείνω. τὸν δʼ ἀπαμειβόμενος προσέφη νεφεληγερέτα Ζεύς·
Castor the tamer of horses, and the boxer Polydeuces. These two the earth, the giver of life, covers, albeit alive, and even in the world below they have honor from Zeus. One day they live in turn, and one day they are dead; and they have won honor like unto that of the gods.	Ἠέλιʼ, ἦ τοι μὲν σὺ μετʼ ἀθανάτοισι φάεινε καὶ θνητοῖσι βροτοῖσιν ἐπὶ ζείδωρον ἄρουραν· τῶν δέ κʼ ἐγὼ τάχα νῆα θοὴν ἀργῆτι κεραυνῷ τυτθὰ βαλὼν κεάσαιμι μέσῳ ἐνὶ οἴνοπι πόντῳ. ταῦτα δʼ ἐγὼν ἤκουσα Καλυψοῦς ἠυκόμοιο·
 “And after her I saw Iphimedeia, wife of Aloeus, who declared that she had lain with Poseidon. She bore two sons, but short of life were they, godlike Otus, and far-famed Ephialtes—men whom the earth, the giver of grain, reared as the tallest,	ἡ δʼ ἔφη Ἑρμείαο διακτόρου αὐτὴ ἀκοῦσαι. αὐτὰρ ἐπεί ῥʼ ἐπὶ νῆα κατήλυθον ἠδὲ θάλασσαν, νείκεον ἄλλοθεν ἄλλον ἐπισταδόν, οὐδέ τι μῆχος εὑρέμεναι δυνάμεσθα, βόες δʼ ἀποτέθνασαν ἤδη. τοῖσιν δʼ αὐτίκʼ ἔπειτα θεοὶ τέραα προύφαινον·
and far the comeliest, after the famous Orion. For at nine years they were nine cubits in breadth and in height nine fathoms. Yea, and they threatened to raise the din of furious war against the immortals in Olympus .	εἷρπον μὲν ῥινοί, κρέα δʼ ἀμφʼ ὀβελοῖσι μεμύκει, ὀπταλέα τε καὶ ὠμά, βοῶν δʼ ὣς γίγνετο φωνή. ἑξῆμαρ μὲν ἔπειτα ἐμοὶ ἐρίηρες ἑταῖροι δαίνυντʼ Ἠελίοιο βοῶν ἐλάσαντες ἀρίστας· ἀλλʼ ὅτε δὴ ἕβδομον ἦμαρ ἐπὶ Ζεὺς θῆκε Κρονίων,
They were fain to pile Ossa on Olympus , and Pelion, with its waving forests, on Ossa, that so heaven might be scaled. And this they would have accomplished, if they had reached the measure of manhood; but the son of Zeus, whom fair-haired Leto bore, slew them both before	καὶ τότʼ ἔπειτʼ ἄνεμος μὲν ἐπαύσατο λαίλαπι θύων, ἡμεῖς δʼ αἶψʼ ἀναβάντες ἐνήκαμεν εὐρέι πόντῳ, ἱστὸν στησάμενοι ἀνά θʼ ἱστία λεύκʼ ἐρύσαντες. ἀλλʼ ὅτε δὴ τὴν νῆσον ἐλείπομεν, οὐδέ τις ἄλλη φαίνετο γαιάων, ἀλλʼ οὐρανὸς ἠδὲ θάλασσα,
the down blossomed beneath their temples and covered their chins with a full growth of beard. “And Phaedra and Procris I saw, and fair Ariadne, the daughter of Minos of baneful mind, whom once Theseus was fain to bear from Crete to the hill of sacred Athens ; but he had no joy of her, for ere that Artemis slew her	δὴ τότε κυανέην νεφέλην ἔστησε Κρονίων νηὸς ὕπερ γλαφυρῆς, ἤχλυσε δὲ πόντος ὑπʼ αὐτῆς. ἡ δʼ ἔθει οὐ μάλα πολλὸν ἐπὶ χρόνον· αἶψα γὰρ ἦλθε κεκληγὼς Ζέφυρος μεγάλῃ σὺν λαίλαπι θύων, ἱστοῦ δὲ προτόνους ἔρρηξʼ ἀνέμοιο θύελλα
in sea-girt Dia because of the witness of Dionysus. “And Maera and Clymene I saw, and hateful Eriphyle, who took precious gold as the price of the life of her own lord. But I cannot tell or name all the wives and daughters of heroes that I saw;	ἀμφοτέρους· ἱστὸς δʼ ὀπίσω πέσεν, ὅπλα τε πάντα εἰς ἄντλον κατέχυνθʼ. ὁ δʼ ἄρα πρυμνῇ ἐνὶ νηὶ πλῆξε κυβερνήτεω κεφαλήν, σὺν δʼ ὀστέʼ ἄραξε πάντʼ ἄμυδις κεφαλῆς· ὁ δʼ ἄρʼ ἀρνευτῆρι ἐοικὼς κάππεσʼ ἀπʼ ἰκριόφιν, λίπε δʼ ὀστέα θυμὸς ἀγήνωρ.
ere that immortal night would wane. Nay, it is now time to sleep, either when I have gone to the swift ship and the crew, or here. My sending shall rest with the gods, and with you.” So he spoke, and they were all hushed in silence, and were held spell-bound throughout the shadowy halls.	Ζεὺς δʼ ἄμυδις βρόντησε καὶ ἔμβαλε νηὶ κεραυνόν· ἡ δʼ ἐλελίχθη πᾶσα Διὸς πληγεῖσα κεραυνῷ, ἐν δὲ θεείου πλῆτο, πέσον δʼ ἐκ νηὸς ἑταῖροι. οἱ δὲ κορώνῃσιν ἴκελοι περὶ νῆα μέλαιναν κύμασιν ἐμφορέοντο, θεὸς δʼ ἀποαίνυτο νόστον.
Then among them white-armed Arete was the first to speak: “Phaeacians, how seems this man to you for comeliness and stature, and for the balanced spirit within him? And moreover he is my guest, though each of you has a share in this honor. Wherefore be not in haste to send him away, nor	αὐτὰρ ἐγὼ διὰ νηὸς ἐφοίτων, ὄφρʼ ἀπὸ τοίχους λῦσε κλύδων τρόπιος, τὴν δὲ ψιλὴν φέρε κῦμα, ἐκ δέ οἱ ἱστὸν ἄραξε ποτὶ τρόπιν. αὐτὰρ ἐπʼ αὐτῷ ἐπίτονος βέβλητο, βοὸς ῥινοῖο τετευχώς· τῷ ῥʼ ἄμφω συνέεργον, ὁμοῦ τρόπιν ἠδὲ καὶ ἱστόν,
stint your gifts to one in such need; for many are the treasures which lie stored in your halls by the favour of the gods.” Then among them spoke also the old lord Echeneus, who was an elder among the Phaeacians:“Friends, verily not wide of the mark or of our own thought	ἑζόμενος δʼ ἐπὶ τοῖς φερόμην ὀλοοῖς ἀνέμοισιν. ἔνθʼ ἦ τοι Ζέφυρος μὲν ἐπαύσατο λαίλαπι θύων, ἦλθε δʼ ἐπὶ Νότος ὦκα, φέρων ἐμῷ ἄλγεα θυμῷ, ὄφρʼ ἔτι τὴν ὀλοὴν ἀναμετρήσαιμι Χάρυβδιν. παννύχιος φερόμην, ἅμα δʼ ἠελίῳ ἀνιόντι
are the words of our wise queen. Nay, do you give heed to them. Yet it is on Alcinous here that deed and word depend.” Then again Alcinous answered him and said:“This word of hers shall verily hold, as surely as I live and am lord over the Phaeacians, lovers of the oar.	ἦλθον ἐπὶ Σκύλλης σκόπελον δεινήν τε Χάρυβδιν. ἡ μὲν ἀνερροίβδησε θαλάσσης ἁλμυρὸν ὕδωρ· αὐτὰρ ἐγὼ ποτὶ μακρὸν ἐρινεὸν ὑψόσʼ ἀερθείς, τῷ προσφὺς ἐχόμην ὡς νυκτερίς. οὐδέ πῃ εἶχον οὔτε στηρίξαι ποσὶν ἔμπεδον οὔτʼ ἐπιβῆναι·
But let our guest, for all his great longing to return, nevertheless endure to remain until tomorrow, till I shall make all our gift complete. His sending shall rest with the men, with all, but most of all with me; for mine is the control in the land.” Then Odysseus of many wiles answered him and said:	ῥίζαι γὰρ ἑκὰς εἶχον, ἀπήωροι δʼ ἔσαν ὄζοι, μακροί τε μεγάλοι τε, κατεσκίαον δὲ Χάρυβδιν. νωλεμέως δʼ ἐχόμην, ὄφρʼ ἐξεμέσειεν ὀπίσσω ἱστὸν καὶ τρόπιν αὖτις· ἐελδομένῳ δέ μοι ἦλθον ὄψʼ· ἦμος δʼ ἐπὶ δόρπον ἀνὴρ ἀγορῆθεν ἀνέστη
 “Lord Alcinous, renowned above all men, if you should bid me abide here even for a year, and should further my sending, and give glorious gifts, even that would I choose; and it would be better far to come with a fuller hand to my dear native land.	κρίνων νείκεα πολλὰ δικαζομένων αἰζηῶν, τῆμος δὴ τά γε δοῦρα Χαρύβδιος ἐξεφαάνθη. ἧκα δʼ ἐγὼ καθύπερθε πόδας καὶ χεῖρε φέρεσθαι, μέσσῳ δʼ ἐνδούπησα παρὲξ περιμήκεα δοῦρα, ἑζόμενος δʼ ἐπὶ τοῖσι διήρεσα χερσὶν ἐμῇσι.
Aye, and I should win more respect and love from all men who should see me when I had returned to Ithaca .” Then again Alcinous made answer and said:“Odysseus, in no wise as we look on thee do we deem this of thee, that thou art a cheat and a dissembler, such as are many	Σκύλλην δʼ οὐκέτʼ ἔασε πατὴρ ἀνδρῶν τε θεῶν τε εἰσιδέειν· οὐ γάρ κεν ὑπέκφυγον αἰπὺν ὄλεθρον. ἔνθεν δʼ ἐννῆμαρ φερόμην, δεκάτῃ δέ με νυκτὶ νῆσον ἐς Ὠγυγίην πέλασαν θεοί, ἔνθα Καλυψὼ ναίει ἐυπλόκαμος, δεινὴ θεὸς αὐδήεσσα,

But upon thee is grace of words, and within thee is a heart of wisdom, and thy tale thou hast told with skill, as doth a minstrel, even the grievous woes of all the Argives and of thine own self.	ἥ μʼ ἐφίλει τʼ ἐκόμει τε. τί τοι τάδε μυθολογεύω; ἤδη γάρ τοι χθιζὸς ἐμυθεόμην ἐνὶ οἴκῳ σοί τε καὶ ἰφθίμῃ ἀλόχῳ· ἐχθρὸν δέ μοί ἐστιν αὖτις ἀριζήλως εἰρημένα μυθολογεύειν.
But come, tell me this, and declare it truly, whether thou sawest any of thy godlike comrades, who went to Ilios together with thee, and there met their fate. The night is before us, long, aye, wondrous long, and it is not yet the time for sleep in the hall. Tell on, I pray thee, the tale of these wondrous deeds.	ὣς ἔφαθʼ, οἱ δʼ ἄρα πάντες ἀκὴν ἐγένοντο σιωπῇ, κηληθμῷ δʼ ἔσχοντο κατὰ μέγαρα σκιόεντα. τὸν δʼ αὖτʼ Ἀλκίνοος ἀπαμείβετο φώνησέν τε· ὦ Ὀδυσεῦ, ἐπεὶ ἵκευ ἐμὸν ποτὶ χαλκοβατὲς δῶ, ὑψερεφές, τῷ σʼ οὔ τι παλιμπλαγχθέντα γʼ ὀΐω ἂψ ἀπονοστήσειν, εἰ καὶ μάλα πολλὰ πέπονθας. ὑμέων δʼ ἀνδρὶ ἑκάστῳ ἐφιέμενος τάδε εἴρω, ὅσσοι ἐνὶ μεγάροισι γερούσιον αἴθοπα οἶνον αἰεὶ πίνετʼ ἐμοῖσιν, ἀκουάζεσθε δʼ ἀοιδοῦ. εἵματα μὲν δὴ ξείνῳ ἐϋξέστῃ ἐνὶ χηλῷ κεῖται καὶ χρυσὸς πολυδαίδαλος ἄλλα τε πάντα δῶρʼ, ὅσα Φαιήκων βουληφόροι ἐνθάδʼ ἔνεικαν· ἀλλʼ ἄγε οἱ δῶμεν τρίποδα μέγαν ἠδὲ λέβητα ἀνδρακάς· ἡμεῖς δʼ αὖτε ἀγειρόμενοι κατὰ δῆμον τισόμεθʼ· ἀργαλέον γὰρ ἕνα προικὸς χαρίσασθαι. ὣς ἔφατʼ Ἀλκίνοος, τοῖσιν δʼ ἐπιὴνδανε μῦθος. οἱ μὲν κακκείοντες ἔβαν οἶκόνδε ἕκαστος, ἦμος δʼ ἠριγένεια φάνη ῥοδοδάκτυλος Ἠώς, νῆάδʼ ἐπεσσεύοντο, φέρον δʼ εὐήνορα χαλκόν. καὶ τὰ μὲν εὖ κατέθηχʼ ἱερὸν μένος Ἀλκινόοιο, αὐτὸς ἰὼν διὰ νηὸς ὑπὸ ζυγά, μή τινʼ ἑταίρων βλάπτοι ἐλαυνόντων, ὁπότε σπερχοίατʼ ἐρετμοῖς. οἱ δʼ εἰς Ἀλκινόοιο κίον καὶ δαῖτʼ ἀλέγυνον. τοῖσι δὲ βοῦν ἱέρευσʼ ἱερὸν μένος Ἀλκινόοιο Ζηνὶ κελαινεφέϊ Κρονίδῃ, ὃς πᾶσιν ἀνάσσει. μῆρα δὲ κήαντες δαίνυντʼ ἐρικυδέα δαῖτα τερπόμενοι· μετὰ δέ σφιν ἐμέλπετο θεῖος ἀοιδός, Δημόδοκος, λαοῖσι τετιμένος. αὐτὰρ Ὀδυσσεὺς πολλὰ πρὸς ἠέλιον κεφαλὴν τρέπε παμφανόωντα, δῦναι ἐπειγόμενος· δὴ γὰρ μενέαινε νέεσθαι. ὡς δʼ ὅτʼ ἀνὴρ δόρποιο λιλαίεται, ᾧ τε πανῆμαρ νειὸν ἀνʼ ἕλκητον βόε οἴνοπε πηκτὸν ἄροτρον· ἀσπασίως δʼ ἄρα τῷ κατέδυ φάος ἠελίοιο δόρπον ἐποίχεσθαι, βλάβεται δέ τε γούνατʼ ἰόντι· ὣς Ὀδυσῆʼ ἀσπαστὸν ἔδυ φάος ἠελίοιο. αἶψα δὲ Φαιήκεσσι φιληρέτμοισι μετηύδα, Ἀλκινόῳ δὲ μάλιστα πιφαυσκόμενος φάτο μῦθον· Ἀλκίνοε κρεῖον, πάντων ἀριδείκετε λαῶν, πέμπετέ με σπείσαντες ἀπήμονα, χαίρετε δʼ αὐτοί· ἤδη γὰρ τετέλεσται ἅ μοι φίλος ἤθελε θυμός, πομπὴ καὶ φίλα δῶρα, τά μοι θεοὶ Οὐρανίωνες ὄλβια ποιήσειαν· ἀμύμονα δʼ οἴκοι ἄκοιτιν νοστήσας εὕροιμι σὺν ἀρτεμέεσσι φίλοισιν. ὑμεῖς δʼ αὖθι μένοντες ἐϋφραίνοιτε γυναῖκας κουριδίας καὶ τέκνα· θεοὶ δʼ ἀρετὴν ὀπάσειαν παντοίην, καὶ μή τι κακὸν μεταδήμιον εἴη. ὣς ἔφαθʼ, οἱ δʼ ἄρα πάντες ἐπῄνεον ἠδʼ ἐκέλευον πεμπέμεναι τὸν ξεῖνον, ἐπεὶ κατὰ μοῖραν ἔειπεν. καὶ τότε κήρυκα προσέφη μένος Ἀλκινόοιο· Ποντόνοε, κρητῆρα κερασσάμενος μέθυ νεῖμον πᾶσιν ἀνὰ μέγαρον, ὄφρʼ εὐξάμενοι Διὶ πατρὶ τὸν ξεῖνον πέμπωμεν ἑὴν ἐς πατρίδα γαῖαν. ὣς φάτο, Ποντόνοος δὲ μελίφρονα οἶνον ἐκίρνα, νώμησεν δʼ ἄρα πᾶσιν ἐπισταδόν· οἱ δὲ θεοῖσιν ἔσπεισαν μακάρεσσι, τοὶ οὐρανὸν εὐρὺν ἔχουσιν, αὐτόθεν ἐξ ἑδρέων. ἀνὰ δʼ ἵστατο δῖος Ὀδυσσεύς, Ἀρήτῃ δʼ ἐν χειρὶ τίθει δέπας ἀμφικύπελλον, καί μιν φωνήσας ἔπεα πτερόεντα προσηύδα· χαῖρέ μοι, ὦ βασίλεια, διαμπερές, εἰς ὅ κε γῆρας ἔλθῃ καὶ θάνατος, τά τʼ ἐπʼ ἀνθρώποισι πέλονται. αὐτὰρ ἐγὼ νέομαι· σὺ δὲ τέρπεο τῷδʼ ἐνὶ οἴκῳ παισί τε καὶ λαοῖσι καὶ Ἀλκινόῳ βασιλῆϊ. ὣς εἰπὼν ὑπὲρ οὐδὸν ἐβήσετο δῖος Ὀδυσσεύς, τῷ δʼ ἅμα κήρυκα προΐει μένος Ἀλκινόοιο, ἡγεῖσθαι ἐπὶ νῆα θοὴν καὶ θῖνα θαλάσσης· Ἀρήτη δʼ ἄρα οἱ δμῳὰς ἅμʼ ἔπεμπε γυναῖκας, τὴν μὲν φᾶρος ἔχουσαν ἐϋπλυνὲς ἠδὲ χιτῶνα, τὴν δʼ ἑτέρην χηλὸν πυκινὴν ἅμʼ ὄπασσε κομίζειν· ἡ δʼ ἄλλη σῖτόν τʼ ἔφερεν καὶ οἶνον ἐρυθρόν. αὐτὰρ ἐπεί ῥʼ ἐπὶ νῆα κατήλυθον ἠδὲ θάλασσαν, αἶψα τά γʼ ἐν νηῒ γλαφυρῇ πομπῆες ἀγαυοὶ δεξάμενοι κατέθεντο, πόσιν καὶ βρῶσιν ἅπασαν· κὰδ δʼ ἄρʼ Ὀδυσσῆϊ στόρεσαν ῥῆγός τε λίνον τε νηὸς ἐπʼ ἰκριόφιν γλαφυρῆς, ἵνα νήγρετον εὕδοι, πρυμνῆς· ἂν δὲ καὶ αὐτὸς ἐβήσετο καὶ κατέλεκτο σιγῇ· τοὶ δὲ καθῖζον ἐπὶ κληῗσιν ἕκαστοι κόσμῳ, πεῖσμα δʼ ἔλυσαν ἀπὸ τρητοῖο λίθοιο. εὖθʼ οἱ ἀνακλινθέντες ἀνερρίπτουν ἅλα πηδῷ, καὶ τῷ νήδυμος ὕπνος ἐπὶ βλεφάροισιν ἔπιπτε, νήγρετος, ἥδιστος, θανάτῳ ἄγχιστα ἐοικώς. ἡ δʼ, ὥς τʼ ἐν πεδίῳ τετράοροι ἄρσενες ἵπποι, πάντες ἅμʼ ὁρμηθέντες ὑπὸ πληγῇσιν ἱμάσθλης, ὑψόσʼ ἀειρόμενοι ῥίμφα πρήσσουσι κέλευθον, ὣς ἄρα τῆς πρύμνη μὲν ἀείρετο, κῦμα δʼ ὄπισθε πορφύρεον μέγα θῦε πολυφλοίσβοιο θαλάσσης. ἡ δὲ μάλʼ ἀσφαλέως θέεν ἔμπεδον· οὐδέ κεν ἴρηξ κίρκος ὁμαρτήσειεν, ἐλαφρότατος πετεηνῶν. ὣς ἡ ῥίμφα θέουσα θαλάσσης κύματʼ ἔταμνεν, ἄνδρα φέρουσα θεοῖς ἐναλίγκια μήδεʼ ἔχοντα· ὃς πρὶν μὲν μάλα πολλὰ πάθʼ ἄλγεα ὃν κατὰ θυμὸν ἀνδρῶν τε πτολέμους ἀλεγεινά τε κύματα πείρων, δὴ τότε γʼ ἀτρέμας εὗδε, λελασμένος ὅσσʼ ἐπεπόνθει. εὖτʼ ἀστὴρ ὑπερέσχε φαάντατος, ὅς τε μάλιστα ἔρχεται ἀγγέλλων φάος Ἠοῦς ἠριγενείης, τῆμος δὴ νήσῳ προσεπίλνατο ποντοπόρος νηῦς.

He knew me straightway, when he had drunk the dark blood, and he wept aloud, and shed big tears, and stretched forth his hands toward me eager to reach me. But no longer had he aught of strength or might remaining such as of old was in his supple limbs.	σῖτον μέν σφιν ἀφεῖλε Μεσαύλιος, οἱ δʼ ἐπὶ κοῖτον σίτου καὶ κρειῶν κεκορημένοι ἐσσεύοντο. νὺξ δʼ ἄρʼ ἐπῆλθε κακὴ σκοτομήνιος, ὗε δʼ ἄρα Ζεὺς πάννυχος, αὐτὰρ ἄη Ζέφυρος μέγας αἰὲν ἔφυδρος. τοῖς δʼ Ὀδυσεὺς μετέειπε, συβώτεω πειρητίζων,
 “When I saw him I wept, and my heart had compassion on him, and I spoke, and addressed him with winged words: ‘Most glorious son of Atreus, king of men, Agamemnon, what fate of grievous death overcame thee? Did Poseidon smite thee on board thy ships,	εἴ πώς οἱ ἐκδὺς χλαῖναν πόροι, ἤ τινʼ ἑταίρων ἄλλον ἐποτρύνειεν, ἐπεί ἑο κήδετο λίην· κέκλυθι νῦν, Εὔμαιε καὶ ἄλλοι πάντες ἑταῖροι, εὐξάμενός τι ἔπος ἐρέω· οἶνος γὰρ ἀνώγει ἠλεός, ὅς τʼ ἐφέηκε πολύφρονά περ μάλʼ ἀεῖσαι
when he had roused a furious blast of cruel winds? Or did foemen work thee harm on the land, while thou wast cutting off their cattle and fair flocks of sheep, or wast fighting to win their city and their women?’ “So I spoke, and he straightway made answer and said:	καί θʼ ἁπαλὸν γελάσαι, καί τʼ ὀρχήσασθαι ἀνῆκε, καί τι ἔπος προέηκεν ὅ περ τʼ ἄρρητον ἄμεινον. ἀλλʼ ἐπεὶ οὖν τὸ πρῶτον ἀνέκραγον, οὐκ ἐπικεύσω. εἴθʼ ὣς ἡβώοιμι βίη τέ μοι ἔμπεδος εἴη, ὡς ὅθʼ ὑπὸ Τροίην λόχον ἤγομεν ἀρτύναντες.
 ‘Son of Laertes, sprung from Zeus, Odysseus of many devices, neither did Poseidon smite me on board my ships, when he had roused a furious blast of cruel winds, nor did foemen work me harm on the land, but Aegisthus wrought for me death and fate,	ἡγείσθην δʼ Ὀδυσεύς τε καὶ Ἀτρεΐδης Μενέλαος, τοῖσι δʼ ἅμα τρίτος ἄρχον ἐγών· αὐτοὶ γὰρ ἄνωγον. ἀλλʼ ὅτε δή ῥʼ ἱκόμεσθα ποτὶ πτόλιν αἰπύ τε τεῖχος, ἡμεῖς μὲν περὶ ἄστυ κατὰ ῥωπήϊα πυκνά, ἂν δόνακας καὶ ἕλος, ὑπὸ τεύχεσι πεπτηῶτες
 and slew me with the aid of my accursed wife, when he had bidden me to his house and made me a feast, even as one slays an ox at the stall. So I died by a most pitiful death, and round about me the rest of my comrades were slain unceasingly like white-tusked swine, which are slaughtered in the house of a rich man of great might	κείμεθα. νὺξ δʼ ἄρʼ ἐπῆλθε κακὴ Βορέαο πεσόντος, πηγυλίς· αὐτὰρ ὕπερθε χιὼν γένετʼ ἠΰτε πάχνη, ψυχρή, καὶ σακέεσσι περιτρέφετο κρύσταλλος. ἔνθʼ ἄλλοι πάντες χλαίνας ἔχον ἠδὲ χιτῶνας, εὗδον δʼ εὔκηλοι, σάκεσιν εἰλυμένοι ὤμους·

Ere now thou hast been present at the slaying of many men, killed in single combat or in the press of the fight, but in heart thou wouldst have felt most pity hadst thou seen that sight, how about the mixing bowl and the laden tables	αὐτὰρ ἐγὼ χλαῖναν μὲν ἰὼν ἑτάροισιν ἔλειπον ἀφραδίῃς, ἐπεὶ οὐκ ἐφάμην ῥιγωσέμεν ἔμπης, ἀλλʼ ἑπόμην σάκος οἶον ἔχων καὶ ζῶμα φαεινόν. ἀλλʼ ὅτε δὴ τρίχα νυκτὸς ἔην, μετὰ δʼ ἄστρα βεβήκει, καὶ τότʼ ἐγὼν Ὀδυσῆα προσηύδων ἐγγὺς ἐόντα
we lay in the hall, and the floor all swam with blood. But the most piteous cry that I heard was that of the daughter of Priam, Cassandra, whom guileful Clytemnestra slew by my side. And I sought to raise my hands and smite down the murderess, dying though I was, pierced through with the sword. But she, the shameless one,	ἀγκῶνι νύξας· ὁ δʼ ἄρʼ ἐμμαπέως ὑπάκουσε· διογενὲς Λαερτιάδη, πολυμήχανʼ Ὀδυσσεῦ, οὔ τοι ἔτι ζωοῖσι μετέσσομαι, ἀλλά με χεῖμα δάμναται· οὐ γὰρ ἔχω χλαῖναν· παρά μʼ ἤπαφε δαίμων οἰοχίτωνʼ ἔμεναι· νῦν δʼ οὐκέτι φυκτὰ πέλονται.
 turned her back upon me, and even though I was going to the house of Hades deigned neither to draw down my eyelids with her fingers nor to close my mouth. So true is it that there is nothing more dread or more shameless than a woman who puts into her heart such deeds, even as she too devised a monstrous thing,	ὣς ἐφάμην, ὁ δʼ ἔπειτα νόον σχέθε τόνδʼ ἐνὶ θυμῷ, οἷος κεῖνος ἔην βουλευέμεν ἠδὲ μάχεσθαι· φθεγξάμενος δʼ ὀλίγῃ ὀπί με πρὸς μῦθον ἔειπε· σίγα νῦν, μή τίς σευ Ἀχαιῶν ἄλλος ἀκούσῃ. ἦ καὶ ἐπʼ ἀγκῶνος κεφαλὴν σχέθεν εἶπέ τε μῦθον·
contriving death for her wedded husband. Verily I thought that I should come home welcome to my children and to my slaves; but she, with her heart set on utter wickedness, has shed shame on herself and on women yet to be, even upon her that doeth uprightly.’	κλῦτε, φίλοι· θεῖός μοι ἐνύπνιον ἦλθεν ὄνειρος. λίην γὰρ νηῶν ἑκὰς ἤλθομεν· ἀλλά τις εἴη εἰπεῖν Ἀτρεΐδῃ Ἀγαμέμνονι, ποιμένι λαῶν, εἰ πλέονας παρὰ ναῦφιν ἐποτρύνειε νέεσθαι. ὣς ἔφατʼ, ὦρτο δʼ ἔπειτα Θόας, Ἀνδραίμονος υἱός,
“So he spoke, and I made answer and said: ‘Ah, verily has Zeus, whose voice is borne afar, visited wondrous hatred on the race of Atreus from the first because of the counsels of women. For Helen's sake many of us perished, and against thee Clytemnestra spread a snare whilst thou wast afar.’	καρπαλίμως, ἀπὸ δὲ χλαῖναν θέτο φοινικόεσσαν, βῆ δὲ θέειν ἐπὶ νῆας· ἐγὼ δʼ ἐνὶ εἵματι κείνου κείμην ἀσπασίως, φάε δὲ χρυσόθρονος Ἠώς. ὣς νῦν ἡβώοιμι βίη τέ μοι ἔμπεδος εἴη· δοίη κέν τις χλαῖναν ἐνὶ σταθμοῖσι συφορβῶν,

Declare not to her all the thoughts of thy heart, but tell her somewhat, and let somewhat also be hidden. Yet not upon thee, Odysseus, shall death come from thy wife,	ἀμφότερον, φιλότητι καὶ αἰδοῖ φωτὸς ἑῆος· νῦν δέ μʼ ἀτιμάζουσι κακὰ χροῒ εἵματʼ ἔχοντα. τὸν δʼ ἀπαμειβόμενος προσέφης, Εὔμαιε συβῶτα· ὦ γέρον, αἶνος μέν τοι ἀμύμων, ὃν κατέλεξας, οὐδέ τί πω παρὰ μοῖραν ἔπος νηκερδὲς ἔειπες·

Verily we left her a bride newly wed, when we went to the war, and a boy was at her breast, a babe, who now, I ween, sits in the ranks of men,	τῷ οὔτʼ ἐσθῆτος δευήσεαι οὔτε τευ ἄλλου, ὧν ἐπέοιχʼ ἱκέτην ταλαπείριον ἀντιάσαντα, νῦν· ἀτὰρ ἠῶθέν γε τὰ σὰ ῥάκεα δνοπαλίξεις. οὐ γὰρ πολλαὶ χλαῖναι ἐπημοιβοί τε χιτῶνες ἐνθάδε ἕννυσθαι, μία δʼ οἴη φωτὶ ἑκάστῳ.
 happy in that his dear father will behold him when he comes, and he will greet his father as is meet. But my wife did not let me sate my eyes even with sight of my own son. Nay, ere that she slew even me, her husband. And another thing will I tell thee, and do thou lay it to heart:	αὐτὰρ ἐπὴν ἔλθῃσιν Ὀδυσσῆος φίλος υἱός, αὐτός τοι χλαῖνάν τε χιτῶνά τε εἵματα δώσει, πέμψει δʼ ὅππῃ σε κραδίη θυμός τε κελεύει. ὣς εἰπὼν ἀνόρουσε, τίθει δʼ ἄρα οἱ πυρὸς ἐγγὺς εὐνήν, ἐν δʼ ὀΐων τε καὶ αἰγῶν δέρματʼ ἔβαλλεν.
in secret and not openly do thou bring thy ship to the shore of thy dear native land; for no longer is there faith in women. But, come, tell me this, and declare it truly, whether haply ye hear of my son as yet alive in Orchomenus it may be, or in sandy Pylos ,	ἔνθʼ Ὀδυσεὺς κατέλεκτʼ· ἐπὶ δὲ χλαῖναν βάλεν αὐτῷ πυκνὴν καὶ μεγάλην, ἥ οἱ παρεκέσκετʼ ἀμοιβάς, ἕννυσθαι ὅτε τις χειμὼν ἔκπαγλος ὄροιτο. ὣς ὁ μὲν ἔνθʼ Ὀδυσεὺς κοιμήσατο, τοὶ δὲ παρʼ αὐτὸν ἄνδρες κοιμήσαντο νεηνίαι· οὐδὲ συβώτῃ
or yet with Menelaus in wide Sparta ; for not yet has goodly Orestes perished on the earth.’ “So he spoke, and I made answer and said: ‘Son of Atreus, wherefore dost thou question me of this? I know not at all whether he be alive or dead, and it is an ill thing to speak words vain as wind.’	ἥνδανεν αὐτόθι κοῖτος, ὑῶν ἄπο κοιμηθῆναι, ἀλλʼ ὅ γʼ ἄρʼ ἔξω ἰὼν ὡπλίζετο· χαῖρε δʼ Ὀδυσσεύς, ὅττι ῥά οἱ βιότου περικήδετο νόσφιν ἐόντος. πρῶτον μὲν ξίφος ὀξὺ περὶ στιβαροῖς βάλετʼ ὤμοις, ἀμφὶ δὲ χλαῖναν ἑέσσατʼ ἀλεξάνεμον, μάλα πυκνήν,

How didst thou dare to come down to Hades, where dwell the unheeding dead, the phantoms of men outworn.’ “‘So he spoke, and I made answer and said:‘Achilles, son of Peleus, far the mightiest of the Achaeans, I came through need of Teiresias, if haply	ἡ δʼ εἰς εὐρύχορον Λακεδαίμονα Παλλὰς Ἀθήνη ᾤχετʼ, Ὀδυσσῆος μεγαθύμου φαίδιμον υἱὸν νόστου ὑπομνήσουσα καὶ ὀτρυνέουσα νέεσθαι. εὗρε δὲ Τηλέμαχον καὶ Νέστορος ἀγλαὸν υἱὸν
he would tell me some plan whereby I might reach rugged Ithaca . For not yet have I come near to the land of Achaea , nor have I as yet set foot on my own country, but am ever suffering woes; whereas than thou, Achilles, no man aforetime was more blessed nor shall ever be hereafter. For of old, when thou wast alive, we Argives honored thee even as the gods,	εὕδοντʼ ἐν προδόμῳ Μενελάου κυδαλίμοιο, ἦ τοι Νεστορίδην μαλακῷ δεδμημένον ὕπνῳ· Τηλέμαχον δʼ οὐχ ὕπνος ἔχε γλυκύς, ἀλλʼ ἐνὶ θυμῷ νύκτα διʼ ἀμβροσίην μελεδήματα πατρὸς ἔγειρεν. ἀγχοῦ δʼ ἱσταμένη προσέφη γλαυκῶπις Ἀθήνη·
and now that thou art here, thou rulest mightily among the dead. Wherefore grieve not at all that thou art dead, Achilles.’ “So I spoke, and he straightway made answer and said: ‘Nay, seek not to speak soothingly to me of death, glorious Odysseus. I should choose, so I might live on earth, to serve as the hireling of another,	Τηλέμαχʼ, οὐκέτι καλὰ δόμων ἄπο τῆλʼ ἀλάλησαι, κτήματά τε προλιπὼν ἄνδρας τʼ ἐν σοῖσι δόμοισιν οὕτω ὑπερφιάλους· μή τοι κατὰ πάντα φάγωσι κτήματα δασσάμενοι, σὺ δὲ τηϋσίην ὁδὸν ἔλθῃς. ἀλλʼ ὄτρυνε τάχιστα βοὴν ἀγαθὸν Μενέλαον

But come, tell me tidings of my son, that lordly youth, whether or not he followed to the war to be a leader. And tell me of noble Peleus, if thou hast heard aught,	πεμπέμεν, ὄφρʼ ἔτι οἴκοι ἀμύμονα μητέρα τέτμῃς. ἤδη γάρ ῥα πατήρ τε κασίγνητοί τε κέλονται Εὐρυμάχῳ γήμασθαι· ὁ γὰρ περιβάλλει ἅπαντας μνηστῆρας δώροισι καὶ ἐξώφελλεν ἔεδνα· μή νύ τι σεῦ ἀέκητι δόμων ἐκ κτῆμα φέρηται.
whether he still has honor among the host of the Myrmidons, or whether men do him dishonor throughout Hellas and Phthia , because old age binds him hand and foot. For I am not there to bear him aid beneath the rays of the sun in such strength as once was mine in wide Troy ,	οἶσθα γὰρ οἷος θυμὸς ἐνὶ στήθεσσι γυναικός· κείνου βούλεται οἶκον ὀφέλλειν ὅς κεν ὀπυίῃ, παίδων δὲ προτέρων καὶ κουριδίοιο φίλοιο οὐκέτι μέμνηται τεθνηκότος οὐδὲ μεταλλᾷ. ἀλλὰ σύ γʼ ἐλθὼν αὐτὸς ἐπιτρέψειας ἕκαστα
when I slew the best of the host in defence of the Argives. If but in such strength I could come, were it but for an hour, to my father's house, I would give many a one of those who do him violence and keep him from his honor, cause to rue my strength and my invincible hands.’ “So he spoke, and I made answer and said:	δμῳάων ἥ τίς τοι ἀρίστη φαίνεται εἶναι, εἰς ὅ κέ τοι φήνωσι θεοὶ κυδρὴν παράκοιτιν. ἄλλο δέ τοί τι ἔπος ἐρέω, σὺ δὲ σύνθεο θυμῷ. μνηστήρων σʼ ἐπιτηδὲς ἀριστῆες λοχόωσιν ἐν πορθμῷ Ἰθάκης τε Σάμοιό τε παιπαλοέσσης.
 ‘Verily of noble Peleus have I heard naught, but as touching thy dear son, Neoptolemus, I will tell thee all the truth, as thou biddest me. I it was, myself, who brought him from Scyros in my shapely, hollow ship to join the host of the well-greaved Archaeans.	ἱέμενοι κτεῖναι, πρὶν πατρίδα γαῖαν ἱκέσθαι. ἀλλὰ τά γʼ οὐκ ὀΐω· πρὶν καί τινα γαῖα καθέξει ἀνδρῶν μνηστήρων, οἵ τοι βίοτον κατέδουσιν. ἀλλὰ ἑκὰς νήσων ἀπέχειν εὐεργέα νῆα, νυκτὶ δʼ ὁμῶς πλείειν· πέμψει δέ τοι οὖρον ὄπισθεν
And verily, as often as we took counsel around the city of Troy , he was ever the first to speak, and made no miss of words; godlike Nestor and I alone surpassed him. But as often as we fought with the bronze on the Trojan plain, he would never remain behind in the throng or press of men,	ἀθανάτων ὅς τίς σε φυλάσσει τε ῥύεταί τε. αὐτὰρ ἐπὴν πρώτην ἀκτὴν Ἰθάκης ἀφίκηαι, νῆα μὲν ἐς πόλιν ὀτρῦναι καὶ πάντας ἑταίρους, αὐτὸς δὲ πρώτιστα συβώτην εἰσαφικέσθαι, ὅς τοι ὑῶν ἐπίουρος, ὁμῶς δέ τοι ἤπια οἶδεν.
 but would ever run forth far to the front, yielding to none in his might; and many men he slew in dread combat. All of them I could not tell or name, all the host that he slew in defence of the Argives; but what a warrior was that son of Telephus whom he slew with the sword,	ἔνθα δὲ νύκτʼ ἀέσαι· τὸν δʼ ὀτρῦναι πόλιν εἴσω ἀγγελίην ἐρέοντα περίφρονι Πηνελοπείῃ, οὕνεκά οἱ σῶς ἐσσὶ καὶ ἐκ Πύλου εἰλήλουθας. ἡ μὲν ἄρʼ ὣς εἰποῦσʼ ἀπέβη πρὸς μακρὸν Ὄλυμπον, αὐτὰρ ὁ Νεστορίδην ἐξ ἡδέος ὕπνου ἔγειρεν
the prince Eurypylus! Aye, and many of his comrades, the Ceteians, were slain about him, because of gifts a woman craved. He verily was the comeliest man I saw, next to goodly Memnon. And again, when we, the best of the Argives, were about to go down into the horse which Epeus made, and the command of all was laid upon me,	λὰξ ποδὶ κινήσας, καί μιν πρὸς μῦθον ἔειπεν· ἔγρεο, Νεστορίδη Πεισίστρατε, μώνυχας ἵππους ζεῦξον ὑφʼ ἅρματʼ ἄγων, ὄφρα πρήσσωμεν ὁδοῖο. τὸν δʼ αὖ Νεστορίδης Πεισίστρατος ἀντίον ηὔδα· Τηλέμαχʼ, οὔ πως ἔστιν ἐπειγομένους περ ὁδοῖο
 both to open and to close the door of our stout-built ambush, then the other leaders and counsellors of the Danaans would wipe away tears from their eyes, and each man's limbs shook beneath him, but never did my eyes see his fair face grow pale at all, nor see him	νύκτα διὰ δνοφερὴν ἐλάαν· τάχα δʼ ἔσσεται ἠώς. ἀλλὰ μένʼ εἰς ὅ κε δῶρα φέρων ἐπιδίφρια θήῃ ἥρως Ἀτρείδης, δουρικλειτὸς Μενέλαος, καὶ μύθοις ἀγανοῖσι παραυδήσας ἀποπέμψῃ. τοῦ γάρ τε ξεῖνος μιμνήσκεται ἤματα πάντα
 wiping tears from his cheeks; but he earnestly besought me to let him go forth from the horse, and kept handling his sword-hilt and his spear heavy with bronze, and was eager to work harm to the Trojans. But after we had sacked the lofty city of Priam, he went on board his ship with his share of the spoil and a goodly prize—	ἀνδρὸς ξεινοδόκου, ὅς κεν φιλότητα παράσχῃ. ὣς ἔφατʼ, αὐτίκα δὲ χρυσόθρονος ἤλυθεν Ἠώς. ἀγχίμολον δέ σφʼ ἦλθε βοὴν ἀγαθὸς Μενέλαος, ἀνστὰς ἐξ εὐνῆς, Ἑλένης πάρα καλλικόμοιο. τὸν δʼ ὡς οὖν ἐνόησεν Ὀδυσσῆος φίλος υἱός,
all unscathed he was, neither smitten with the sharp spear nor wounded in close fight, as often befalls in war; for Ares rages confusedly.’ “So I spoke, and the spirit of the son of Aeacus departed with long strides over the field of asphodel,	σπερχόμενός ῥα χιτῶνα περὶ χροῒ σιγαλόεντα δῦνεν, καὶ μέγα φᾶρος ἐπὶ στιβαροῖς βάλετʼ ὤμοις ἥρως, βῆ δὲ θύραζε, παριστάμενος δὲ προσηύδα Τηλέμαχος, φίλος υἱὸς Ὀδυσσῆος θείοιο· Ἀτρεΐδη Μενέλαε διοτρεφές, ὄρχαμε λαῶν,
joyful in that I said that his son was preeminent. “And other spirits of those dead and gone stood sorrowing, and each asked of those dear to him. Alone of them all the spirit of Aias, son of Telamon, stood apart, still full of wrath for the victory	ἤδη νῦν μʼ ἀπόπεμπε φίλην ἐς πατρίδα γαῖαν· ἤδη γάρ μοι θυμὸς ἐέλδεται οἴκαδʼ ἱκέσθαι. τὸν δʼ ἠμείβετʼ ἔπειτα βοὴν ἀγαθὸς Μενέλαος· Τηλέμαχʼ, οὔ τί σʼ ἐγώ γε πολὺν χρόνον ἐνθάδʼ ἐρύξω ἱέμενον νόστοιο· νεμεσσῶμαι δὲ καὶ ἄλλῳ
 that I had won over him in the contest by the ships for the arms of Achilles, whose honored mother had set them for a prize; and the judges were the sons of the Trojans and Pallas Athena. I would that I had never won in the contest for such a prize, over so noble a head did the earth close because of those arms,	ἀνδρὶ ξεινοδόκῳ, ὅς κʼ ἔξοχα μὲν φιλέῃσιν, ἔξοχα δʼ ἐχθαίρῃσιν· ἀμείνω δʼ αἴσιμα πάντα. ἶσόν τοι κακόν ἐσθʼ, ὅς τʼ οὐκ ἐθέλοντα νέεσθαι ξεῖνον ἐποτρύνει καὶ ὃς ἐσσύμενον κατερύκει. χρὴ ξεῖνον παρεόντα φιλεῖν, ἐθέλοντα δὲ πέμπειν.
even over Aias, who in comeliness and in deeds of war was above all the other Achaeans, next to the peerless son of Peleus. To him I spoke with soothing words: “‘Aias, son of peerless Telamon, wast thou then not even in death to forget thy wrath against me because of those accursed arms? Surely the gods set them to be a bane to the Argives: such a tower of strength was lost to them in thee; and for thee in death we Achaeans sorrow unceasingly, even as for the life of Achilles, son of Peleus. Yet no other is to blame but Zeus,	ἀλλὰ μένʼ εἰς ὅ κε δῶρα φέρων ἐπιδίφρια θείω καλά, σὺ δʼ ὀφθαλμοῖσιν ἴδῃς, εἴπω δὲ γυναιξὶ δεῖπνον ἐνὶ μεγάροις τετυκεῖν ἅλις ἔνδον ἐόντων. ἀμφότερον, κῦδός τε καὶ ἀγλαΐη καὶ ὄνειαρ, δειπνήσαντας ἴμεν πολλὴν ἐπʼ ἀπείρονα γαῖαν.
who bore terrible hatred against the host of Danaan spearmen, and brought on thee thy doom. Nay, come hither, prince, that thou mayest hear my word and my speech; and subdue thy wrath and thy proud spirit.’ “So I spoke, but he answered me not a word, but went his way to Erebus to join the other spirits of those dead and gone. Then would he nevertheless have spoken to me for all his wrath, or I to him, but the heart in my breast was fain to see the spirits of those others that are dead. “There then I saw Minos, the glorious son of Zeus, golden sceptre in hand, giving judgment to the dead from his seat, while they sat and stood about the king through the wide-gated house of Hades, and asked of him judgment. “And after him I marked huge Orion driving together over the field of asphodel wild beasts which he himself had slain on the lonely hills, and in his hands he held a club all of bronze, ever unbroken. “And I saw Tityos, son of glorious Gaea, lying on the ground. Over nine roods he stretched, and two vultures sat, one on either side, and tore his liver, plunging their beaks into his bowels, nor could he beat them off with his hands. For he had offered violence to Leto, the glorious wife of Zeus, as she went toward Pytho through Panopeus with its lovely lawns. “Aye, and I saw Tantalus in violent torment, standing in a pool, and the water came nigh unto his chin. He seemed as one athirst, but could not take and drink; for as often as that old man stooped down, eager to drink, so often would the water be swallowed up and vanish away, and at his feet the black earth would appear, for some god made all dry. And trees, high and leafy, let stream their fruits above his head, pears, and pomegranates, and apple trees with their bright fruit, and sweet figs, and luxuriant olives. But as often as that old man would reach out toward these, to clutch them with his hands, the wind would toss them to the shadowy clouds. “Aye, and I saw Sisyphus in violent torment, seeking to raise a monstrous stone with both his hands. Verily he would brace himself with hands and feet, and thrust the stone toward the crest of a hill, but as often as he was about to heave it over the top, the weight would turn it back, and then down again to the plain would come rolling the ruthless stone. But he would strain again and thrust it back, and the sweat flowed down from his limbs, and dust rose up from his head. “And after him I marked the mighty Heracles—his phantom; for he himself among the immortal gods takes his joy in the feast, and has to wife Hebe, of the fair ankles, daughter of great Zeus and of Here, of the golden sandals. About him rose a clamor from the dead, as of birds flying everywhere in terror; and he like dark night, with his bow bare and with arrow on the string, glared about him terribly, like one in act to shoot. Awful was the belt about his breast, a baldric of gold, whereon wondrous things were fashioned, bears and wild boars, and lions with flashing eyes, and conflicts, and battles, and murders, and slayings of men. May he never have designed, or hereafter design such another, even he who stored up in his craft the device of that belt. He in turn knew me when his eyes beheld me, and weeping spoke to me winged words: “‘Son of Laertes, sprung from Zeus, Odysseus of many devices, ah, wretched man, dost thou, too, drag out an evil lot such as I once bore beneath the rays of the sun? I was the son of Zeus, son of Cronos, but I had woe beyond measure; for to a man far worse than I was I made subject, and he laid on me hard labours. Yea, he once sent me hither to fetch the hound of Hades, for he could devise for me no other task mightier than this.	εἰ δʼ ἐθέλεις τραφθῆναι ἀνʼ Ἑλλάδα καὶ μέσον Ἄργος, ὄφρα τοι αὐτὸς ἕπωμαι, ὑποζεύξω δέ τοι ἵππους, ἄστεα δʼ ἀνθρώπων ἡγήσομαι· οὐδέ τις ἡμέας αὔτως ἀππέμψει, δώσει δέ τι ἕν γε φέρεσθαι, ἠέ τινα τριπόδων εὐχάλκων ἠὲ λεβήτων,
The hound I carried off and led forth from the house of Hades; and Hermes was my guide, and flashing-eyed Athena.’ “So saying, he went his way again into the house of Hades, but I abode there steadfastly, in the hope that some other haply might still come forth of the warrior heroes who died in the days of old. And I should have seen yet others of the men of former time, whom I was fain to behold, even Theseus and Peirithous, glorious children of the gods, but ere that the myriad tribes of the dead came thronging up with a wondrous cry, and pale fear seized me, lest august Persephone might send forth upon me from out the house of Hades the head of the Gorgon, that awful monster. “Straightway then I went to the ship and bade my comrades themselves to embark, and to loose the stern cables. So they went on board quickly and sat down upon the benches. And the ship was borne down the stream Oceanus by the swelling flood, first with our rowing, and afterwards the wind was fair.	ἠὲ δύʼ ἡμιόνους ἠὲ χρύσειον ἄλεισον. τὸν δʼ αὖ Τηλέμαχος πεπνυμένος ἀντίον ηὔδα· Ἀτρεΐδη Μενέλαε διοτρεφές, ὄρχαμε λαῶν, βούλομαι ἤδη νεῖσθαι ἐφʼ ἡμέτερʼ· οὐ γὰρ ὄπισθεν οὖρον ἰὼν κατέλειπον ἐπὶ κτεάτεσσιν ἐμοῖσιν·
“Now after our ship had left the stream of the river Oceanus and had come to the wave of the broad sea, and the Aeaean isle, where is the dwelling of early Dawn and her dancing-lawns, and the risings of the sun, there on our coming we beached our ship on the sands, and ourselves went forth upon the shore of the sea, and there we fell asleep, and waited for the bright Dawn. “As soon as early Dawn appeared, the rosy-fingered, then I sent forth my comrades to the house of Circe to fetch the body of the dead Elpenor. Straightway then we cut billets of wood and gave him burial where the headland runs furthest out to sea, sorrowing and shedding big tears. But when the dead man was burned, and the armour of the dead, we heaped up a mound and dragged on to it a pillar, and on the top of the mound we planted his shapely oar. “We then were busied with these several tasks, howbeit Circe was not unaware of our coming forth from the house of Hades, but speedily she arrayed herself and came, and her handmaids brought with her bread and meat in abundance and flaming red wine. And the beautiful goddess stood in our midst, and spoke among us, saying: “‘Rash men, who have gone down alive to the house of Hades to meet death twice, while other men die but once. Nay, come, eat food and drink wine here this whole day through; but at the coming of Dawn ye shall set sail, and I will point out the way and declare to you each thing, in order that ye may not suffer pain and woes through wretched ill-contriving either by sea or on land.’ “So she spoke, and our proud hearts consented. So then all day long till set of sun we sat feasting on abundant flesh and sweet wine. But when the sun set and darkness came on, they lay down to rest beside the stern cables of the ship; but Circe took me by the hand, and leading me apart from my dear comrades, made me to sit, and herself lay down close at hand and asked me all the tale.	ἀγχίμολον δέ οἱ ἦλθε Βοηθοΐδης Ἐτεωνεύς, ἀνστὰς ἐξ εὐνῆς, ἐπεὶ οὐ πολὺ ναῖεν ἀπʼ αὐτοῦ· τὸν πῦρ κῆαι ἄνωγε βοὴν ἀγαθὸς Μενέλαος ὀπτῆσαί τε κρεῶν· ὁ δʼ ἄρʼ οὐκ ἀπίθησεν ἀκούσας. αὐτὸς δʼ ἐς θάλαμον κατεβήσετο κηώεντα,
And I told her all in due order. Then queenly Circe spoke to me and said: “All these things have thus found an end; but do thou hearken as I shall tell thee, and a god shall himself bring it to thy mind. To the Sirens first shalt thou come, who beguile all men whosoever comes to them. Whoso in ignorance draws near to them and hears the Sirens' voice, he nevermore returns, that his wife and little children may stand at his side rejoicing, but the Sirens beguile him with their clear-toned song,	οὐκ οἶος, ἅμα τῷ γʼ Ἑλένη κίε καὶ Μεγαπένθης. ἀλλʼ ὅτε δή ῥʼ ἵκανον ὅθι κειμήλια κεῖτο, Ἀτρεΐδης μὲν ἔπειτα δέπας λάβεν ἀμφικύπελλον, υἱὸν δὲ κρητῆρα φέρειν Μεγαπένθεʼ ἄνωγεν ἀργύρεον· Ἑλένη δὲ παρίστατο φωριαμοῖσιν,
 as they sit in a meadow, and about them is a great heap of bones of mouldering men, and round the bones the skin is shrivelling. But do thou row past them, and anoint the ears of thy comrades with sweet wax, which thou hast kneaded, lest any of the rest may hear. But if thou thyself hast a will to listen,	ἔνθʼ ἔσαν οἱ πέπλοι παμποίκιλοι, οὓς κάμεν αὐτή. τῶν ἕνʼ ἀειραμένη Ἑλένη φέρε, δῖα γυναικῶν, ὃς κάλλιστος ἔην ποικίλμασιν ἠδὲ μέγιστος, ἀστὴρ δʼ ὣς ἀπέλαμπεν· ἔκειτο δὲ νείατος ἄλλων. βὰν δʼ ἰέναι προτέρω διὰ δώματος, ἧος ἵκοντο
let them bind thee in the swift ship hand and foot upright in the step of the mast, and let the ropes be made fast at the ends to the mast itself, that with delight thou mayest listen to the voice of the two Sirens. And if thou shalt implore and bid thy comrades to loose thee, then let them bind thee with yet more bonds. But when thy comrades shall have rowed past these, thereafter I shall not fully say on which side thy course is to lie, but do thou thyself ponder it in mind, and I will tell thee of both ways. For on the one hand are beetling crags, and against them roars the great wave of dark-eyed Amphitrite; the Planctae do the blessed gods call these. Thereby not even winged things may pass, no, not the timorous doves that bear ambrosia to father Zeus, but the smooth rock ever snatches away one even of these, and the father sends in another to make up the tale. And thereby has no ship of men ever yet escaped that has come thither, but the planks of ships and bodies of men are whirled confusedly by the waves of the sea and the blasts of baneful fire. One seafaring ship alone has passed thereby, that Argo famed of all, on her voyage from Aeetes, and even her the wave would speedily have dashed there against the great crags, had not Here sent her through, for that Jason was dear to her. “‘Now on the other path are two cliffs, one of which reaches with its sharp peak to the broad heaven, and a dark cloud surrounds it. This never melts away, nor does clear sky ever surround that peak in summer or in harvest time. No mortal man could scale it or set foot upon the top, not though he had twenty hands and feet; for the rock is smooth, as if it were polished.	Τηλέμαχον· τὸν δὲ προσέφη ξανθὸς Μενέλαος· Τηλέμαχʼ, ἦ τοι νόστον, ὅπως φρεσὶ σῇσι μενοινᾷς, ὥς τοι Ζεὺς τελέσειεν, ἐρίγδουπος πόσις Ἥρης. δώρων δʼ, ὅσσʼ ἐν ἐμῷ οἴκῳ κειμήλια κεῖται, δώσω ὃ κάλλιστον καὶ τιμηέστατόν ἐστι.
 And in the midst of the cliff is a dim cave, turned to the West, toward Erebus, even where you shall steer your hollow ship, glorious Odysseus. Not even a man of might could shoot an arrow from the hollow ship so as to reach into that vaulted cave.	δώσω τοι κρητῆρα τετυγμένον· ἀργύρεος δὲ ἐστὶν ἅπας, χρυσῷ δʼ ἐπὶ χείλεα κεκράανται, ἔργον δʼ Ἡφαίστοιο· πόρεν δέ ἑ Φαίδιμος ἥρως, Σιδονίων βασιλεύς, ὅθʼ ἑὸς δόμος ἀμφεκάλυψε κεῖσέ με νοστήσαντα· τεῒν δʼ ἐθέλω τόδʼ ὀπάσσαι.
Therein dwells Scylla, yelping terribly. Her voice is indeed but as the voice of a new-born whelp, but she herself is an evil monster, nor would anyone be glad at sight of her, no, not though it were a god that met her. Verily she has twelve feet, all misshapen,	ὣς εἰπὼν ἐν χειρὶ τίθει δέπας ἀμφικύπελλον ἥρως Ἀτρεΐδης· ὁ δʼ ἄρα κρητῆρα φαεινὸν θῆκʼ αὐτοῦ προπάροιθε φέρων κρατερὸς Μεγαπένθης, ἀργύρεον· Ἑλένη δὲ παρίστατο καλλιπάρῃος πέπλον ἔχουσʼ ἐν χερσίν, ἔπος τʼ ἔφατʼ ἔκ τʼ ὀνόμαζε·
and six necks, exceeding long, and on each one an awful head, and therein three rows of teeth, thick and close, and full of black death. Up to her middle she is hidden in the hollow cave, but she holds her head out beyond the dread chasm, and fishes there, eagerly searching around the rock for dolphins and sea-dogs and whatever greater beast she may haply catch, such creatures as deep-moaning Amphitrite rears in multitudes past counting. By her no sailors yet may boast that they have fled unscathed in their ship, for with each head she carries off	δῶρόν τοι καὶ ἐγώ, τέκνον φίλε, τοῦτο δίδωμι, μνῆμʼ Ἑλένης χειρῶν, πολυηράτου ἐς γάμου ὥρην, σῇ ἀλόχῳ φορέειν· τῆος δὲ φίλῃ παρὰ μητρὶ κείσθω ἐνὶ μεγάρῳ. σὺ δέ μοι χαίρων ἀφίκοιο οἶκον ἐϋκτίμενον καὶ σὴν ἐς πατρίδα γαῖαν.
there is no defence; to flee from her is bravest. For if thou tarriest to arm thyself by the cliff, I fear lest she may again dart forth and attack thee with as many heads and seize as many men as before. Nay, row past with all thy might, and call upon Crataiis, the mother of Scylla, who bore her for a bane to mortals. Then will she keep her from darting forth again. “‘And thou wilt come to the isle Thrinacia. There in great numbers feed the kine of Helios and his goodly flocks, seven herds of kine and as many fair flocks of sheep,	ὣς εἰποῦσʼ ἐν χερσὶ τίθει, ὁ δʼ ἐδέξατο χαίρων. καὶ τὰ μὲν ἐς πείρινθα τίθει Πεισίστρατος ἥρως δεξάμενος, καὶ πάντα ἑῷ θηήσατο θυμῷ· τοὺς δʼ ἦγε πρὸς δῶμα κάρη ξανθὸς Μενέλαος. ἑζέσθην δʼ ἄρʼ ἔπειτα κατὰ κλισμούς τε θρόνους τε.
 and fifty in each. These bear no young, nor do they ever die, and goddesses are their shepherds, fair-tressed nymphs, Phaethusa and Lampetie, whom beautiful Neaera bore to Helios Hyperion. These their honored mother, when she had borne and reared them,	χέρνιβα δʼ ἀμφίπολος προχόῳ ἐπέχευε φέρουσα καλῇ χρυσείῃ, ὑπὲρ ἀργυρέοιο λέβητος, νίψασθαι· παρὰ δὲ ξεστὴν ἐτάνυσσε τράπεζαν. σῖτον δʼ αἰδοίη ταμίη παρέθηκε φέρουσα· εἴδατα πόλλʼ ἐπιθεῖσα, χαριζομένη παρεόντων·
sent to the isle Thrinacia to dwell afar, and keep the flocks of their father and his sleek kine. If thou leavest these unharmed and heedest thy homeward way, verily ye may yet reach Ithaca , though in evil plight. But if thou harmest them, then I foretell ruin for thy ship and for thy comrades, and even if thou shalt thyself escape, late shalt thou come home and in evil case, after losing all thy comrades.’ “So she spoke, and presently came golden-throned Dawn. Then the beautiful goddess departed up the island, but I went to the ship and roused my comrades	πὰρ δὲ Βοηθοΐδης κρέα δαίετο καὶ νέμε μοίρας· οἰνοχόει δʼ υἱὸς Μενελάου κυδαλίμοιο. οἱ δʼ ἐπʼ ὀνείαθʼ ἑτοῖμα προκείμενα χεῖρας ἴαλλον. αὐτὰρ ἐπεὶ πόσιος καὶ ἐδητύος ἐξ ἔρον ἕντο, δὴ τότε Τηλέμαχος καὶ Νέστορος ἀγλαὸς υἱὸς
themselves to embark and to loose the stern cables. So they went on board straightway and sat down upon the benches, and sitting well in order smote the grey sea with their oars. And for our aid in the wake of our dark-prowed ship a fair wind that filled the sail, a goodly comrade, was sent by fair-tressed Circe, dread goddess of human speech. So when we had straightway made fast all the tackling throughout the ship we sat down, but the wind and the helmsman guided the ship. “Then verily I spoke among my comrades, grieved at heart: ‘Friends, since it is not right that one or two alone should know the oracles that Circe, the beautiful goddess, told me, therefore will I tell them, in order that knowing them we may either die or, shunning death and fate, escape. First she bade us avoid the voice of the wondrous Sirens, and their flowery meadow. Me alone she bade to listen to their voice; but do ye bind me with grievous bonds, that I may abide fast where I am, upright in the step of the mast, and let the ropes be made fast at the ends to the mast itself; and if I implore and bid you to loose me, then do ye tie me fast with yet more bonds.’	ἵππους τε ζεύγνυντʼ ἀνά θʼ ἅρματα ποικίλʼ ἔβαινον, ἐκ δʼ ἔλασαν προθύροιο καὶ αἰθούσης ἐριδούπου. τοὺς δὲ μετʼ Ἀτρεΐδης ἔκιε ξανθὸς Μενέλαος, οἶνον ἔχων ἐν χειρὶ μελίφρονα δεξιτερῆφι, ἐν δέπαϊ χρυσέῳ, ὄφρα λείψαντε κιοίτην.
 “Thus I rehearsed all these things and told them to my comrades. Meanwhile the well-built ship speedily came to the isle of the two Sirens, for a fair and gentle wind bore her on. Then presently the wind ceased and there was a windless calm, and a god lulled the waves to sleep.	στῆ δʼ ἵππων προπάροιθε, δεδισκόμενος δὲ προσηύδα· χαίρετον, ὦ κούρω, καὶ Νέστορι ποιμένι λαῶν εἰπεῖν· ἦ γὰρ ἐμοί γε πατὴρ ὣς ἤπιος ἦεν, ἧος ἐνὶ Τροίῃ πολεμίζομεν υἷες Ἀχαιῶν. τὸν δʼ αὖ Τηλέμαχος πεπνυμένος ἀντίον ηὔδα·
But my comrades rose up and furled the sail and stowed it in the hollow ship, and thereafter sat at the oars and made the water white with their polished oars of fir. But I with my sharp sword cut into small bits a great round cake of wax, and kneaded it with my strong hands, and soon the wax grew warm, forced by the strong pressure and the rays of the lord Helios Hyperion. Then I anointed with this the ears of all my comrades in turn; and they bound me in the ship hand and foot, upright in the step of the mast, and made the ropes fast at the ends to the mast itself;	καὶ λίην κείνῳ γε, διοτρεφές, ὡς ἀγορεύεις, πάντα τάδʼ ἐλθόντες καταλέξομεν· αἲ γὰρ ἐγὼν ὣς νοστήσας Ἰθάκηνδε, κιχὼν Ὀδυσῆʼ ἐνὶ οἴκῳ, εἴποιμʼ ὡς παρὰ σεῖο τυχὼν φιλότητος ἁπάσης ἔρχομαι, αὐτὰρ ἄγω κειμήλια πολλὰ καὶ ἐσθλά.
and themselves sitting down smote the grey sea with their oars. But when we were as far distant as a man can make himself heard when he shouts, driving swiftly on our way, the Sirens failed not to note the swift ship as it drew near, and they raised their clear-toned song: “‘Come hither, as thou farest, renowned Odysseus, great glory of the Achaeans; stay thy ship that thou mayest listen to the voice of us two. For never yet has any man rowed past this isle in his black ship until he has heard the sweet voice from our lips. Nay, he has joy of it, and goes his way a wiser man. For we know all the toils that in wide Troy	ὣς ἄρα οἱ εἰπόντι ἐπέπτατο δεξιὸς ὄρνις, αἰετὸς ἀργὴν χῆνα φέρων ὀνύχεσσι πέλωρον, ἥμερον ἐξ αὐλῆς· οἱ δʼ ἰΰζοντες ἕποντο ἀνέρες ἠδὲ γυναῖκες· ὁ δέ σφισιν ἐγγύθεν ἐλθὼν δεξιὸς ἤϊξε πρόσθʼ ἵππων· οἱ δὲ ἰδόντες
the Argives and Trojans endured through the will of the gods, and we know all things that come to pass upon the fruitful earth.’ “So they spoke, sending forth their beautiful voice, and my heart was fain to listen, and I bade my comrades loose me, nodding to them with my brows; but they fell to their oars and rowed on. And presently Perimedes and Eurylochus arose and bound me with yet more bonds and drew them tighter. But when they had rowed past the Sirens, and we could no more hear their voice or their song, then straightway my trusty comrades took away the wax with which I had anointed their ears and loosed me from my bonds. “But when we had left the island, I presently saw smoke and a great billow, and heard a booming. Then from the hands of my men in their terror the oars flew, and splashed one and all in the swirl, and	γήθησαν, καὶ πᾶσιν ἐνὶ φρεσὶ θυμὸς ἰάνθη. τοῖσι δὲ Νεστορίδης Πεισίστρατος ἤρχετο μύθων· φράζεο δή, Μενέλαε διοτρεφές, ὄρχαμε λαῶν, ἢ νῶϊν τόδʼ ἔφηνε θεὸς τέρας ἦε σοὶ αὐτῷ. ὣς φάτο, μερμήριξε δʼ ἀρηΐφιλος Μενέλαος,
the ship stood still where it was, when they no longer plied with their hands the tapering oars. But I went through the ship and cheered my men with gentle words, coming up to each man in turn: “‘Friends, hitherto we have been in no wise ignorant of sorrow; surely this evil that besets us now is no greater than when the Cyclops	ὅππως οἱ κατὰ μοῖραν ὑποκρίναιτο νοήσας. τὸν δʼ Ἑλένη τανύπεπλος ὑποφθαμένη φάτο μῦθον· κλῦτέ μευ· αὐτὰρ ἐγὼ μαντεύσομαι, ὡς ἐνὶ θυμῷ ἀθάνατοι βάλλουσι καὶ ὡς τελέεσθαι ὀΐω. ὡς ὅδε χῆνʼ ἥρπαξʼ ἀτιταλλομένην ἐνὶ οἴκῳ
penned us in his hollow cave by brutal strength; yet even thence we made our escape through my valor and counsel and wit; these dangers, too, methinks we shall some day remember. But now come, as I bid, let us all obey. Do you keep your seats on the benches and smite with your oars the deep surf of the sea, in the hope that Zeus may grant us to escape and avoid this death. And to thee, steersman, I give this command, and do thou lay it to heart, since thou wieldest the steering oar of the hollow ship. From this smoke and surf keep the ship well away and hug the cliff, lest, ere thou know it, the ship swerve off to the other side and thou cast us into destruction.’ “So I spoke, and they quickly hearkened to my words. But of Scylla I went not on to speak, a cureless bane, lest haply my comrades, seized with fear, should cease	ἐλθὼν ἐξ ὄρεος, ὅθι οἱ γενεή τε τόκος τε, ὣς Ὀδυσεὺς κακὰ πολλὰ παθὼν καὶ πόλλʼ ἐπαληθεὶς οἴκαδε νοστήσει καὶ τίσεται· ἠὲ καὶ ἤδη οἴκοι, ἀτὰρ μνηστῆρσι κακὸν πάντεσσι φυτεύει. τὴν δʼ αὖ Τηλέμαχος πεπνυμένος ἀντίον ηὔδα·
from rowing and huddle together in the hold. Then verily I forgot the hard command of Circe, whereas she bade me in no wise to arm myself; but when I had put on my glorious armour and grasped in my hand two long spears, I went to the fore-deck of the ship, whence I deemed that Scylla of the rock would first be seen, who was to bring ruin upon my comrades. But nowhere could I descry her, and my eyes grew weary as I gazed everywhere toward the misty rock. “We then sailed on up the narrow strait with wailing.	οὕτω νῦν Ζεὺς θείη, ἐρίγδουπος πόσις Ἥρης· τῷ κέν τοι καὶ κεῖθι θεῷ ὣς εὐχετοῴμην. ἦ καὶ ἐφʼ ἵπποιϊν μάστιν βάλεν· οἱ δὲ μάλʼ ὦκα ἤϊξαν πεδίονδε διὰ πτόλιος μεμαῶτες. οἱ δὲ πανημέριοι σεῖον ζυγὸν ἀμφὶς ἔχοντες.
For on one side lay Scylla and on the other divine Charybdis terribly sucked down the salt water of the sea. Verily whenever she belched it forth, like a cauldron on a great fire she would seethe and bubble in utter turmoil, and high over head the spray would fall on the tops of both the cliffs. But as often as she sucked down the salt water of the sea, within she could all be seen in utter turmoil, and round about the rock roared terribly, while beneath the earth appeared black with sand; and pale fear seized my men. So we looked toward her and feared destruction; but meanwhile Scylla seized from out the hollow ship six of my comrades who were the best in strength and in might. Turning my eyes to the swift ship and to the company of my men, even then I noted above me their feet and hands as they were raised aloft. To me they cried aloud, calling upon me	δύσετό τʼ ἠέλιος σκιόωντό τε πᾶσαι ἀγυιαί· ἐς Φηρὰς δʼ ἵκοντο Διοκλῆος ποτὶ δῶμα, υἱέος Ὀρτιλόχοιο, τὸν Ἀλφειὸς τέκε παῖδα. ἔνθα δὲ νύκτʼ ἄεσαν ὁ δὲ τοῖς πὰρ ξείνια θῆκεν. ἦμος δʼ ἠριγένεια φάνη ῥοδοδάκτυλος Ἠώς,
by name for that last time in anguish of heart. And as a fisher on a jutting rock, when he casts in his baits as a snare to the little fishes, with his long pole lets down into the sea the horn of an ox of the steading, and then as he catches a fish flings it writhing ashore,	ἵππους τε ζεύγνυντʼ ἀνά θʼ ἅρματα ποικίλʼ ἔβαινον, ἐκ δʼ ἔλασαν προθύροιο καὶ αἰθούσης ἐριδούπου· μάστιξεν δʼ ἐλάαν, τὼ δʼ οὐκ ἄκοντε πετέσθην. αἶψα δʼ ἔπειθʼ ἵκοντο Πύλου αἰπὺ πτολίεθρον· καὶ τότε Τηλέμαχος προσεφώνεε Νέστορος υἱόν·
even so were they drawn writhing up towards the cliffs. Then at her doors she devoured them shrieking and stretching out their hands toward me in their awful death-struggle. Most piteous did mine eyes behold that thing of all that I bore while I explored the paths of the sea. “Now when we had escaped the rocks, and dread Charybdis and Scylla, presently then we came to the goodly island of the god, where were the fair kine, broad of brow, and the many goodly flocks of Helios Hyperion. Then while I was still out at sea in my black ship,	Νεστορίδη, πῶς κέν μοι ὑποσχόμενος τελέσειας μῦθον ἐμόν; ξεῖνοι δὲ διαμπερὲς εὐχόμεθʼ εἶναι ἐκ πατέρων φιλότητος, ἀτὰρ καὶ ὁμήλικές εἰμεν· ἥδε δʼ ὁδὸς καὶ μᾶλλον ὁμοφροσύνῃσιν ἐνήσει. μή με παρὲξ ἄγε νῆα, διοτρεφές, ἀλλὰ λίπʼ αὐτοῦ,
I heard the lowing of the cattle that were being stalled and the bleating of the sheep, and upon my mind fell the words of the blind seer, Theban Teiresias, and of Aeaean Circe, who very straitly charged me to shun the island of Helios, who gives joy to mortals. Then verily I spoke among my comrades, grieved at heart: “‘Hear my words, comrades, for all your evil plight, that I may tell you the oracles of Teiresias and of Aeaean Circe, who very straitly charged me to shun the island of Helios, who gives joy to mortals; for there, she said, was our most terrible bane. Nay, row the black ship out past the island.’ “So I spoke, but their spirit was broken within them, and straightway Eurylochus answered me with hateful words: “‘Hardy art thou, Odysseus; thou hast strength beyond that of other men and thy limbs never	μή μʼ ὁ γέρων ἀέκοντα κατάσχῃ ᾧ ἐνὶ οἴκῳ ἱέμενος φιλέειν· ἐμὲ δὲ χρεὼ θᾶσσον ἱκέσθαι. ὣς φάτο, Νεστορίδης δʼ ἄρʼ ἑῷ συμφράσσατο θυμῷ, ὅππως οἱ κατὰ μοῖραν ὑποσχόμενος τελέσειεν. ὧδε δέ οἱ φρονέοντι δοάσσατο κέρδιον εἶναι·
 grow weary. Verily thou art wholly wrought of iron, seeing that thou sufferest not thy comrades, worn out with toil and drowsiness, to set foot on shore, where on this sea-girt isle we might once more make ready a savoury supper; but thou biddest us even as we are to wander on through the swift night,	στρέψʼ ἵππους ἐπὶ νῆα θοὴν καὶ θῖνα θαλάσσης, νηῒ δʼ ἐνὶ πρύμνῃ ἐξαίνυτο κάλλιμα δῶρα, ἐσθῆτα χρυσόν τε, τά οἱ Μενέλαος ἔδωκε· καί μιν ἐποτρύνων ἔπεα πτερόεντα προσηύδα· σπουδῇ νῦν ἀνάβαινε κέλευέ τε πάντας ἑταίρους,
driven away from the island over the misty deep. It is from the night that fierce winds are born, wreckers of ships. How could one escape utter destruction, if haply there should suddenly come a blast of the South Wind or the blustering West Wind , which oftenest	πρὶν ἐμὲ οἴκαδʼ ἱκέσθαι ἀπαγγεῖλαί τε γέροντι. εὖ γὰρ ἐγὼ τόδε οἶδα κατὰ φρένα καὶ κατὰ θυμόν· οἷος κείνου θυμὸς ὑπέρβιος, οὔ σε μεθήσει, ἀλλʼ αὐτὸς καλέων δεῦρʼ εἴσεται, οὐδέ ἕ φημι ἂψ ἰέναι κενεόν· μάλα γὰρ κεχολώσεται ἔμπης.
wreck ships in despite of the sovereign gods? Nay, verily for this time let us yield to black night and make ready our supper, remaining by the swift ship, and in the morning we will go aboard, and put out into the broad sea.’ “So spoke Eurylochus, and the rest of my comrades gave assent. Then verily I knew that some god was assuredly devising ill, and I spoke and addressed him with winged words: “‘Eurylochus, verily ye constrain me, who stand alone. But come now, do ye all swear to me a mighty oath, to the end that, if we haply find a herd of kine or a great flock of sheep, no man may slay either cow or sheep in the blind folly of his mind; but be content to eat the food which immortal Circe gave.’ “So I spoke; and they straightway swore that they would not, even as I bade them. But when they had sworn and made an end of the oath, we moored our well-built ship in the hollow harbor near a spring of sweet water, and my comrades went forth from the ship and skilfully made ready their supper. But when they had put from them the desire of food and drink, then they fell to weeping, as they remembered their dear comrades	ὣς ἄρα φωνήσας ἔλασεν καλλίτριχας ἵππους ἂψ Πυλίων εἰς ἄστυ, θοῶς δʼ ἄρα δώμαθʼ ἵκανε. Τηλέμαχος δʼ ἑτάροισιν ἐποτρύνων ἐκέλευσεν· ἐγκοσμεῖτε τὰ τεύχεʼ, ἑταῖροι, νηῒ μελαίνῃ, αὐτοί τʼ ἀμβαίνωμεν, ἵνα πρήσσωμεν ὁδοῖο.
whom Scylla had snatched from out the hollow ship and devoured; and sweet sleep came upon them as they wept. But when it was the third watch of the night, and the stars had turned their course, Zeus, the cloud-gatherer, roused against us a fierce wind with a wondrous tempest, and hid with clouds the land and sea alike, and night rushed down from heaven. And as soon as early Dawn appeared, the rosy-fingered, we dragged our ship, and made her fast in a hollow cave, where were the fair dancing-floors and seats of the nymphs. Then I called my men together and spoke among them: “‘Friends, in our swift ship is meat and drink; let us therefore keep our hands from those kine lest we come to harm, for these are the cows and goodly sheep of a dread god, even of Helios, who oversees all things and overhears all things.’ “So I spoke, and their proud hearts consented.	ὣς ἔφαθʼ, οἱ δʼ ἄρα τοῦ μάλα μὲν κλύον ἠδʼ ἐπίθοντο, αἶψα δʼ ἄρʼ εἴσβαινον καὶ ἐπὶ κληῗσι καθῖζον. ἦ τοι ὁ μὲν τὰ πονεῖτο καὶ εὔχετο, θῦε δʼ Ἀθήνῃ νηῒ πάρα πρυμνῇ· σχεδόθεν δέ οἱ ἤλυθεν ἀνὴρ τηλεδαπός, φεύγων ἐξ Ἄργεος ἄνδρα κατακτάς,
Then for a full month the South Wind blew unceasingly, nor did any other wind arise except the East and the South. “Now so long as my men had grain and red wine they kept their hands from the kine, for they were eager to save their lives. But when all the stores had been consumed from out the ship,	μάντις· ἀτὰρ γενεήν γε Μελάμποδος ἔκγονος ἦεν, ὃς πρὶν μέν ποτʼ ἔναιε Πύλῳ ἔνι, μητέρι μήλων, ἀφνειὸς Πυλίοισι μέγʼ ἔξοχα δώματα ναίων· δὴ τότε γʼ ἄλλων δῆμον ἀφίκετο, πατρίδα φεύγων Νηλέα τε μεγάθυμον, ἀγαυότατον ζωόντων,
and now they must needs roam about in search of game, fishes, and fowl, and whatever might come to their hands—fishing with bent hooks, for hunger pinched their bellies—then I went apart up the island that I might pray to the gods in the hope that one of them might show me a way to go. And when, as I went through the island, I had got away from my comrades, I washed my hands in a place where there was shelter from the wind, and prayed to all the gods that hold Olympus ; but they shed sweet sleep upon my eyelids. And meanwhile Eurylochus began to give evil counsel to my comrades:	ὅς οἱ χρήματα πολλὰ τελεσφόρον εἰς ἐνιαυτὸν εἶχε βίῃ. ὁ δὲ τῆος ἐνὶ μεγάροις Φυλάκοιο δεσμῷ ἐν ἀργαλέῳ δέδετο, κρατέρʼ ἄλγεα πάσχων εἵνεκα Νηλῆος κούρης ἄτης τε βαρείης, τήν οἱ ἐπὶ φρεσὶ θῆκε θεὰ δασπλῆτις Ἐρινύς.
 “‘Hear my words, comrades, for all your evil plight. All forms of death are hateful to wretched mortals, but to die of hunger, and so meet one's doom, is the most pitiful. Nay, come, let us drive off the best of the kine of Helios and offer sacrifice to the immortals who hold broad heaven.	ἀλλʼ ὁ μὲν ἔκφυγε κῆρα καὶ ἤλασε βοῦς ἐριμύκους ἐς Πύλον ἐκ Φυλάκης καὶ ἐτίσατο ἔργον ἀεικὲς ἀντίθεον Νηλῆα, κασιγνήτῳ δὲ γυναῖκα ἠγάγετο πρὸς δώμαθʼ. ὁ δʼ ἄλλων ἵκετο δῆμον, Ἄργος ἐς ἱππόβοτον· τόθι γάρ νύ οἱ αἴσιμον ἦεν
And if we ever reach Ithaca , our native land, we will straightway build a rich temple to Helios Hyperion and put therein many goodly offerings. And if haply he be wroth at all because of his straight-horned kine, and be minded to destroy our ship, and the other gods consent, rather would I lose my life once for all with a gulp at the wave, than pine slowly away in a desert isle.’ “So spoke Eurylochus, and the rest of my comrades gave assent. Straightway they drove off the best of the kine of Helios from near at hand, for not far from the dark-prowed ship were grazing the fair, sleek kine, broad of brow. Around these, then, they stood and made prayer to the gods, plucking the tender leaves from off a high-crested oak; for they had no white barley on board the well-benched ship. Now when they had prayed and had cut the throats of the kine and flayed them,	ναιέμεναι πολλοῖσιν ἀνάσσοντʼ Ἀργείοισιν ἔνθα δʼ ἔγημε γυναῖκα καὶ ὑψερεφὲς θέτο δῶμα, γείνατο δʼ Ἀντιφάτην καὶ Μάντιον, υἷε κραταιώ. Ἀντιφάτης μὲν ἔτικτεν Ὀϊκλῆα μεγάθυμον, αὐτὰρ Ὀϊκλείης λαοσσόον Ἀμφιάραον,
they cut out the thigh-pieces and covered them with a double layer of fat and laid raw flesh upon them. They had no wine to pour over the blazing sacrifice, but they made libations with water, and roasted all the entrails over the fire. Now when the thighs were wholly burned and they had tasted the inner parts,	ὃν περὶ κῆρι φίλει Ζεύς τʼ αἰγίοχος καὶ Ἀπόλλων παντοίην φιλότητʼ· οὐδʼ ἵκετο γήραος οὐδόν, ἀλλʼ ὄλετʼ ἐν Θήβῃσι γυναίων εἵνεκα δώρων. τοῦ δʼ υἱεῖς ἐγένοντʼ Ἀλκμαίων Ἀμφίλοχός τε. Μάντιος αὖ τέκετο Πολυφείδεά τε Κλεῖτόν τε·
they cut up the rest and spitted it. Then it was that sweet sleep fled from my eyelids, and I went my way to the swift ship and the shore of the sea. But when, as I went, I drew near to the curved ship, then verily the hot savour of the fat was wafted about me, and I groaned and cried aloud to the immortal gods: “‘Father Zeus and ye other blessed gods that are for ever, verily it was for my ruin that ye lulled me in pitiless sleep, while my comrades remaining behind have contrived a monstrous deed.’ “Swiftly then to Helios Hyperion came Lampetie of the long robes, bearing tidings that we had slain his kine; and straightway he spoke among the immortals, wroth at heart: “‘Father Zeus and ye other blessed gods that are for ever, take vengeance now on the comrades of Odysseus, son of Laertes, who have insolently slain my kine, in which I	ἀλλʼ ἦ τοι Κλεῖτον χρυσόθρονος ἥρπασεν Ἠὼς κάλλεος εἵνεκα οἷο, ἵνʼ ἀθανάτοισι μετείη· αὐτὰρ ὑπέρθυμον Πολυφείδεα μάντιν Ἀπόλλων θῆκε βροτῶν ὄχʼ ἄριστον, ἐπεὶ θάνεν Ἀμφιάραος· ὅς ῥʼ Ὑπερησίηνδʼ ἀπενάσσατο πατρὶ χολωθείς,
ever took delight, when I went toward the starry heaven and when I turned back again to earth from heaven. If they do not pay me fit atonement for the kine I will go down to Hades and shine among the dead.’ “Then Zeus, the cloud-gatherer, answered him and said: ‘Helios, do thou verily shine on among the immortals and among mortal men upon the earth, the giver of grain. As for these men I will soon smite their swift ship with my bright thunder-bolt, and shatter it to pieces in the midst of the wine-dark sea.’ “This I heard from fair-haired Calypso, and she said that she herself had heard it from the messenger Hermes. “But when I had come down to the ship and to the sea I upbraided my men, coming up to each in turn, but we could find no remedy—the kine were already dead. For my men, then, the gods straightway shewed forth portents. The hides crawled, the flesh, both roast and raw, bellowed upon the spits, and there was a lowing as of kine. “For six days, then, my trusty comrades feasted on the best of the kine of Helios which they had driven off. But when Zeus, the son of Cronos, brought upon us the seventh day, then the wind ceased to blow tempestuously, and we straightway went on board, and put out into the broad sea when we had set up the mast and hoisted the white sail. “But when we had left that island and no other land appeared, but only sky and sea,	ἔνθʼ ὅ γε ναιετάων μαντεύετο πᾶσι βροτοῖσιν. τοῦ μὲν ἄρʼ υἱὸς ἐπῆλθε, Θεοκλύμενος δʼ ὄνομʼ ἦεν, ὃς τότε Τηλεμάχου πέλας ἵστατο· τὸν δʼ ἐκίχανεν σπένδοντʼ εὐχόμενόν τε θοῇ παρὰ νηῒ μελαίνῃ, καί μιν φωνήσας ἔπεα πτερόεντα προσηύδα·
then verily the son of Cronos set a black cloud above the hollow ship, and the sea grew dark beneath it. She ran on for no long time, for straightway came the shrieking West Wind , blowing with a furious tempest, and the blast of the wind snapped both the fore-stays of the mast, so that the mast fell backward and all its tackling was strewn in the bilge. On the stern of the ship the mast struck the head of the pilot and crushed all the bones of his skull together, and like a diver he fell from the deck and his proud spirit left his bones.	ὦ φίλʼ, ἐπεί σε θύοντα κιχάνω τῷδʼ ἐνὶ χώρῳ, λίσσομʼ ὑπὲρ θυέων καὶ δαίμονος, αὐτὰρ ἔπειτα σῆς τʼ αὐτοῦ κεφαλῆς καὶ ἑταίρων, οἵ τοι ἕπονται, εἰπέ μοι εἰρομένῳ νημερτέα μηδʼ ἐπικεύσῃς· τίς πόθεν εἶς ἀνδρῶν; πόθι τοι πόλις ἠδὲ τοκῆες;
Therewith Zeus thundered and hurled his bolt upon the ship, and she quivered from stem to stern, smitten by the bolt of Zeus, and was filled with sulphurous smoke, and my comrades fell from out the ship. Like sea-crows they were borne on the waves about the black ship, and the god took from them their returning. But I kept pacing up and down the ship till the surge tore the sides from the keel, and the wave bore her on dismantled and snapped the mast off at the keel; but over the mast had been flung the back-stay fashioned of ox-hide; with this I lashed the two together, both keel and mast, and sitting on these was borne by the direful winds. “Then verily the West Wind ceased to blow tempestuously, and swiftly the South Wind came, bringing sorrow to my heart, that I might traverse again the way to baneful Charybdis . All night long was I borne, and at the rising of the sun	τὸν δʼ αὖ Τηλέμαχος πεπνυμένος ἀντίον ηὔδα· τοιγὰρ ἐγώ τοι, ξεῖνε, μάλʼ ἀτρεκέως ἀγορεύσω. ἐξ Ἰθάκης γένος εἰμί, πατὴρ δέ μοί ἐστιν Ὀδυσσεύς, εἴ ποτʼ ἔην· νῦν δʼ ἤδη ἀπέφθιτο λυγρῷ ὀλέθρῳ. τοὔνεκα νῦν ἑτάρους τε λαβὼν καὶ νῆα μέλαιναν
I came to the cliff of Scylla and to dread Charybdis . She verily sucked down the salt water of the sea, but I, springing up to the tall fig-tree, laid hold of it, and clung to it like a bat. Yet I could in no wise plant my feet firmly or climb upon the tree, for its roots spread far below and its branches hung out of reach above, long and great, and overshadowed Charybdis . There I clung steadfastly until she should vomit forth mast and keel again, and to my joy they came at length. At the hour when a man rises from the assembly for his supper,	ἦλθον πευσόμενος πατρὸς δὴν οἰχομένοιο. τὸν δʼ αὖτε προσέειπε Θεοκλύμενος θεοειδής· οὕτω τοι καὶ ἐγὼν ἐκ πατρίδος, ἄνδρα κατακτὰς ἔμφυλον· πολλοὶ δὲ κασίγνητοί τε ἔται τε Ἄργος ἀνʼ ἱππόβοτον, μέγα δὲ κρατέουσιν Ἀχαιῶν.
one that decides the many quarrels of young men that seek judgment, even at that hour those spars appeared from out Charybdis . And I let go hands and feet from above and plunged down into the waters out beyond the long spars, and sitting on these I rowed onward with my hands. But as for Scylla, the father of gods and men did not suffer her again to catch sight of me, else should I never have escaped utter destruction. “Thence for nine days was I borne, and on the tenth night the gods brought me to Ogygia, where the fair-tressed Calypso dwells, dread goddess of human speech,	τῶν ὑπαλευάμενος θάνατον καὶ κῆρα μέλαιναν φεύγω, ἐπεί νύ μοι αἶσα κατʼ ἀνθρώπους ἀλάλησθαι. ἀλλά με νηὸς ἔφεσσαι, ἐπεί σε φυγὼν ἱκέτευσα, μή με κατακτείνωσι· διωκέμεναι γὰρ ὀΐω. τὸν δʼ αὖ Τηλέμαχος πεπνυμένος ἀντίον ηὔδα·
 who gave me welcome and tendance. But why should I tell thee this tale? For it was but yesterday that I told it in thy hall to thyself and to thy noble wife. It is an irksome thing, meseems, to tell again a plain-told tale.”	οὐ μὲν δή σʼ ἐθέλοντά γʼ ἀπώσω νηὸς ἐΐσης, ἀλλʼ ἕπευ· αὐτὰρ κεῖθι φιλήσεαι, οἷά κʼ ἔχωμεν. ὣς ἄρα φωνήσας οἱ ἐδέξατο χάλκεον ἔγχος, καὶ τό γʼ ἐπʼ ἰκριόφιν τάνυσεν νεὸς ἀμφιελίσσης· ἂν δὲ καὶ αὐτὸς νηὸς ἐβήσετο ποντοπόροιο.
So he spoke, and they were all hushed in silence, and were spellbound throughout the shadowy halls. And Alcinous again answered him, and said: “Odysseus, since thou hast come to my high-roofed house with floor of brass, thou shalt not, methinks, be driven back, and return with baffled purpose, even though thou hast suffered much. And to each man of you that in my halls are ever wont to drink the flaming wine of the elders, and to listen to the minstrel, I speak, and give this charge. Raiment for the stranger lies already stored in the polished chest, with gold curiously wrought and all the other gifts which the counsellors of the Phaeacians brought hither. But, come now, let us give him a great tripod and a cauldron, each man of us, and we in turn will gather the cost from among the people, and repay ourselves. It were hard for one man to give freely, without requital.” So spake Alcinous, and his word was pleasing to them. They then went, each man to his house, to take their rest; but as soon as early Dawn appeared, the rosy-fingered, they hastened to the ship and brought the bronze, that gives strength to men. And the strong and mighty Alcinous went himself throughout the ship, and carefully stowed the gifts beneath the benches, that they might not hinder any of the crew at their rowing, when they busily plied the oars. Then they went to the house of Alcinous, and prepared a feast. And for them the strong and mighty Alcinous sacrificed a bull to Zeus, son of Cronos, god of the dark clouds, who is lord of all. Then, when they had burned the thigh-pieces, they feasted a glorious feast, and made merry, and among them the divine minstrel Demodocus, held in honor by the people, sang to the lyre. But Odysseus would ever turn his head toward the blazing sun, eager to see it set, for verily he was eager to return home. And as a man longs for supper, for whom all day long a yoke of wine-dark oxen has drawn the jointed plough through fallow land, and gladly for him does the light of the sun sink, that he may busy him with his supper, and his knees grow weary as he goes; even so gladly for Odysseus did the light of the sun sink. Straightway then he spoke among the Phaeacians, lovers of the oar, and to Alcinous above all he declared his word, and said: “Lord Alcinous, renowned above all men, pour libations now, and send ye me on my way in peace; and yourselves too—Farewell! For now all that my heart desired has been brought to pass: a convoy, and gifts of friendship. May the gods of heaven bless them to me, and on my return may I find in my home my peerless wife with those I love unscathed; and may you again, remaining here, make glad your wedded wives and children; and may the gods grant you prosperity of every sort, and may no evil come upon your people.” So he spoke, and they all praised his words, and bade send the stranger on his way, since he had spoken fittingly. Then the mighty Alcinous spoke to the herald, saying: “Pontonous, mix the bowl, and serve out wine to all in the hall, in order that, when we have made prayer to father Zeus, we may send forth the stranger to his own native land.” So he spoke, and Pontonous mixed the honey hearted wine and served out to all, coming up to each in turn; and they poured libations to the blessed gods, who hold broad heaven, from where they sat. But goodly Odysseus arose, and placed in the hand of Arete the two-handled cup, and spoke, and addressed her with winged words: “Fare thee well, O queen, throughout all the years, till old age and death come, which are the lot of mortals. As for me, I go my way, but do thou in this house have joy of thy children and thy people and Alcinous the king.” So the goodly Odysseus spake and passed over the threshold. And with him the mighty Alcinous sent forth a herald to lead him to the swift ship and the shore of the sea. And Arete sent with him slave women, one bearing a newly washed cloak and a tunic, and another again she bade follow to bear the strong chest, and yet another bore bread and red wine. But when they had come down to the ship and to the sea, straightway the lordly youths that were his escort took these things, and stowed them in the hollow ship, even all the food and drink. Then for Odysseus they spread a rug and a linen sheet on the deck of the hollow ship at the stern, that he might sleep soundly; and he too went aboard, and laid him down in silence. Then they sat down on the benches, each in order, and loosed the hawser from the pierced stone. And as soon as they leaned back, and tossed the brine with their oarblades, sweet sleep fell upon his eyelids, an unawakening sleep, most sweet, and most like to death. And as on a plain four yoked stallions spring forward all together beneath the strokes of the lash, and leaping on high swiftly accomplish their way, even so the stern of that ship leapt on high, and in her wake the dark wave of the loud-sounding sea foamed mightily, and she sped safely and surely on her way; not even the circling hawk, the swiftest of winged things, could have kept pace with her. Thus she sped on swiftly and clove the waves of the sea, bearing a man the peer of the gods in counsel, one who in time past had suffered many griefs at heart in passing through wars of men and the grievous waves; but now he slept in peace, forgetful of all that he had suffered. Now when that brightest of stars rose which ever comes to herald the light of early Dawn, even then the seafaring ship drew near to the island. There is in the land of Ithaca a certain harbor of Phorcys, the old man of the sea, and at its mouth two projecting headlands sheer to seaward, but sloping down on the side toward the harbor. These keep back the great waves raised by heavy winds without, but within the benched ships lie unmoored when they have reached the point of anchorage. At the head of the harbor is a long-leafed olive tree, and near it a pleasant, shadowy cave sacred to the nymphs that are called Naiads. Therein are mixing bowls and jars of stone, and there too the bees store honey. And in the cave are long looms of stone, at which the nymphs weave webs of purple dye, a wonder to behold; and therein are also ever-flowing springs. Two doors there are to the cave, one toward the North Wind , by which men go down, but that toward the South Wind is sacred, nor do men enter thereby; it is the way of the immortals. Here they rowed in, knowing the place of old; and the ship ran full half her length on the shore in her swift course, at such pace was she driven by the arms of the rowers. Then they stepped forth from the benched ship upon the land, and first they lifted Odysseus out of the hollow ship, with the linen sheet and bright rug as they were, and laid him down on the sand, still overpowered by sleep. And they lifted out the goods which the lordly Phaeacians had given him, as he set out for home, through the favour of great-hearted Athena. These they set all together by the trunk of the olive tree, out of the path, lest haply some wayfarer, before Odysseus awoke, might come upon them and spoil them. Then they themselves returned home again. But the Shaker of the Earth did not forget the threats wherewith at the first he had threatened godlike Odysseus, and he thus enquired of the purpose of Zeus: “Father Zeus, no longer shall I, even I, be held in honor among the immortal gods, seeing that mortals honor me not a whit— even the Phaeacians, who, thou knowest, are of my own lineage. For I but now declared that Odysseus should suffer many woes ere he reached his home, though I did not wholly rob him of his return when once thou hadst promised it and confirmed it with thy nod; yet in his sleep these men have borne him in a swift ship over the sea and set him down in Ithaca , and have given him gifts past telling, stores of bronze and gold and woven raiment, more than Odysseus would ever have won for himself from Troy , if he had returned unscathed with his due share of the spoil.” Then Zeus, the cloud-gatherer, answered him, and said: “Ah me, thou shaker of the earth, wide of sway, what a thing hast thou said! The gods do thee no dishonor; hard indeed would it be to assail with dishonor our eldest and best. But as for men, if any one, yielding to his might and strength, fails to do thee honor in aught, thou mayest ever take vengeance, even thereafter. Do as thou wilt, and as is thy good pleasure.” Then Poseidon, the earth-shaker, answered him: “Straightway should I have done as thou sayest, thou god of the dark clouds, but I ever dread and avoid thy wrath. But now I am minded to smite the fair ship of the Phaeacians, as she comes back from his convoy on the misty deep, that hereafter they may desist and cease from giving convoy to men, and to fling a great mountain about their city.” Then Zeus, the cloud-gatherer, answered him and said: “Lazy one, hear what seems best in my sight. When all the people are looking forth from the city upon her as she speeds on her way, then do thou turn her to stone hard by the land—a stone in the shape of a swift ship, that all men may marvel; and do thou fling a great mountain about their city.” Now when Poseidon, the earth-shaker, heard this he went his way to Scheria , where the Phaeacians dwell, and there he waited. And she drew close to shore, the seafaring ship, speeding swiftly on her way. Then near her came the Earth-shaker and turned her to stone, and rooted her fast beneath by a blow of the flat of his hand, and then he was gone. But they spoke winged words to one another, the Phaeacians of the long oars, men famed for their ships. And thus would one speak, with a glance at his neighbor: “Ah me, who has now bound our swift ship on the sea as she sped homeward? Lo, she was in plain sight.” So would one of them speak, but they knew not how these things were to be. Then Alcinous addressed their company and said: “Lo now, verily the oracles of my father, uttered long ago, have come upon me. He was wont to say that Poseidon was wroth with us because we give safe convoy to all men. He said that some day, as a beautiful ship of the Phaeacians was returning from a convoy over the misty deep, Poseidon would smite her, and would fling a great mountain about our town. So that old man spoke, and lo, now all this is being brought to pass. But now come, as I bid let us all obey. Cease ye to give convoy to mortals, when anyone comes to our city, and let us sacrifice to Poseidon twelve choice bulls, if haply he may take pity, and not fling a lofty mountain about our town.” So he spoke, and they were seized with fear and made ready the bulls. Thus they were praying to the lord Poseidon, the leaders and counsellors of the land of the Phaeacians, as they stood about the altar, but Odysseus awoke out of his sleep in his native land. Yet he knew it not after his long absence, for about him the goddess had shed a mist, even Pallas Athena, daughter of Zeus, that she might render him unknown, and tell him all things, so that his wife might not know him, nor his townsfolk, nor his friends, until the wooers had paid the full price of all their transgressions. Therefore all things seemed strange to their lord, the long paths, the bays offering safe anchorage, the sheer cliffs, and the luxuriant trees. So he sprang up and stood and looked upon his native land, and then he groaned and smote both of his thighs with the flat of his hands, and mournfully spoke, and said: “Woe is me, to the land of what mortals am I now come? Are they cruel, and wild, and unjust, or do they love strangers and fear the gods in their thoughts? Whither shall I bear all this wealth, or whither shall I myself go wandering on? Would that I had remained there among the Phaeacians, and had then come to some other of the mighty kings, who would have entertained me and sent me on my homeward way. But now I know not where to bestow this wealth; yet here will I not leave it, lest haply it become the spoil of others to my cost. Out upon them; not wholly wise, it seems, nor just were the leaders and counsellors of the Phaeacians who have brought me to a strange land. Verily they said that they would bring me to clear-seen Ithaca , but they have not made good their word. May Zeus, the suppliant's god, requite them, who watches over all men, and punishes him that sins. But come, I will number the goods, and go over them, lest to my cost these men have carried off aught with them in the hollow ship.” So he spake, and set him to count the beautiful tripods, and the cauldrons, and the gold, and the fair woven raiment, and of these he missed nothing. Then, mournfully longing for his native land, he paced by the shore of the loud-sounding sea, uttering many a moan. And Athena drew near him in the form of a young man, a herdsman of sheep, one most delicate, as are the sons of princes. In a double fold about her shoulders she wore a well-wrought cloak, and beneath her shining feet she had sandals, and in her hands a spear. Then Odysseus was glad at sight of her, and came to meet her, and he spoke, and addressed her with winged words: “Friend, since thou art the first to whom I have come in this land, hail to thee, and mayst thou meet me with no evil mind. Nay, save this treasure, and save me; for to thee do I pray, as to a god, and am come to thy dear knees. And tell me this also truly, that I may know full well. What land, what people is this? What men dwell here? Is it some clear-seen island, or a shore of the deep-soiled mainland that lies resting on the sea?” Then the goddess, flashing-eyed Athena, answered him: “A fool art thou, stranger, or art come from far, if indeed thou askest of this land. Surely it is no wise so nameless, but full many know it, both all those who dwell toward the dawn and the sun, and all those that are behind toward the murky darkness. It is a rugged isle, not fit for driving horses, yet it is not utterly poor, though it be but narrow. Therein grows corn beyond measure, and the wine-grape as well, and the rain never fails it, nor the rich dew. It is a good land for pasturing goats and kine; there are trees of every sort, and in it also pools for watering that fail not the year through. Therefore, stranger, the name of Ithaca has reached even to the land of Troy which, they say, is far from this land of Achaea.” So she spake, and the much-enduring, goodly Odysseus was glad, and rejoiced in his land, the land of his fathers, as he heard the word of Pallas Athena, daughter of Zeus, who bears the aegis; and he spoke, and addressed her with winged words; yet he spoke not the truth, but checked the word ere it was uttered, ever revolving in his breast thoughts of great cunning: “I heard of Ithaca , even in broad Crete , far over the sea; and now have I myself come hither with these my goods. And I left as much more with my children, when I fled the land, after I had slain the dear son of Idomeneus, Orsilochus, swift of foot, who in broad Crete surpassed in fleetness all men that live by toil. Now he would have robbed me of all that booty of Troy , for which I had borne grief of heart, passing through wars of men and the grievous waves, for that I would not shew favour to his father, and serve as his squire in the land of the Trojans, but commanded other men of my own. So I smote him with my bronze-tipped spear as he came home from the field, lying in wait for him with one of my men by the roadside. A dark night covered the heavens, and no man was ware of us, but unseen I took away his life. Now when I had slain him with the sharp bronze, I went straightway to a ship, and made prayer to the lordly Phoenicians, giving them booty to satisfy their hearts. I bade them take me aboard and land me at Pylos , or at goodly Elis , where the Epeans hold sway. Yet verily the force of the wind thrust them away from thence, sore against their will, nor did they purpose to play me false; but driven wandering from thence we came hither by night. With eager haste we rowed on into the harbor, nor had we any thought of supper, sore as was our need of it, but even as we were we went forth from the ship and lay down, one and all. Then upon me came sweet sleep in my weariness, but they took my goods out of the hollow ship and set them where I myself lay on the sands. And they went on board, and departed for the well-peopled land of Sidon ; but I was left here, my heart sore troubled.” So he spoke, and the goddess, flashing-eyed Athena, smiled, and stroked him with her hand, and changed herself to the form of a woman, comely and tall, and skilled in glorious handiwork. And she spoke, and addressed him with winged words: “Cunning must he be and knavish, who would go beyond thee in all manner of guile, aye, though it were a god that met thee. Bold man, crafty in counsel, insatiate in deceit, not even in thine own land, it seems, wast thou to cease from guile and deceitful tales, which thou lovest from the bottom of thine heart. But come, let us no longer talk of this, being both well versed in craft, since thou art far the best of all men in counsel and in speech, and I among all the gods am famed for wisdom and craft. Yet thou didst not know Pallas Athena, daughter of Zeus, even me, who ever stand by thy side, and guard thee in all toils. Aye, and I made thee beloved by all the Phaeacians. And now am I come hither to weave a plan with thee, and to hide all the treasure, which the lordly Phaeacians gave thee by my counsel and will, when thou didst set out for home; and to tell thee all the measure of woe it is thy fate to fulfil in thy well-built house. But do thou be strong, for bear it thou must, and tell no man of them all nor any woman that thou hast come back from thy wanderings, but in silence endure thy many griefs, and submit to the violence of men.” Then Odysseus of many wiles answered her, and said: “Hard is it, goddess, for a mortal man to know thee when he meets thee, how wise soever he be, for thou takest what shape thou wilt. But this I know well, that of old thou wast kindly toward me, so long as we sons of the Achaeans were warring in the land of Troy . But after we had sacked the lofty city of Priam, and had gone away in our ships, and a god had scattered the Achaeans, never since then have I seen thee, daughter of Zeus, nor marked thee coming on board my ship, that thou mightest ward off sorrow from me. Nay, I ever wandered on, bearing in my breast a stricken heart, till the gods delivered me from evil, even until in the rich land of the Phaeacians thou didst cheer me with thy words, and thyself lead me to their city. But now I beseech thee by thy father—for I think not	ἐν πρύμνῃ δʼ ἄρʼ ἔπειτα καθέζετο, πὰρ δὲ οἷ αὐτῷ εἷσε Θεοκλύμενον· τοὶ δὲ πρυμνήσιʼ ἔλυσαν. Τηλέμαχος δʼ ἑτάροισιν ἐποτρύνας ἐκέλευσεν ὅπλων ἅπτεσθαι· τοὶ δʼ ἐσσυμένως ἐπίθοντο. ἱστὸν δʼ εἰλάτινον κοίλης ἔντοσθε μεσόδμης
that I am come to clear-seen Ithaca ; nay, it is some other land over which I roam, and thou, methinks, dost speak thus in mockery to beguile my mind—tell me whether in very truth I am come to my dear native land.” Then the goddess, flashing-eyed Athena, answered him:	στῆσαν ἀείραντες, κατὰ δὲ προτόνοισιν ἔδησαν, ἕλκον δʼ ἱστία λευκὰ ἐϋστρέπτοισι βοεῦσι. τοῖσιν δʼ ἴκμενον οὖρον ἵει γλαυκῶπις Ἀθήνη, λάβρον ἐπαιγίζοντα διʼ αἰθέρος, ὄφρα τάχιστα νηῦς ἀνύσειε θέουσα θαλάσσης ἁλμυρὸν ὕδωρ.
 “Ever such is the thought in thy breast, and therefore it is that I cannot leave thee in thy sorrow, for thou art soft of speech, keen of wit, and prudent. Eagerly would another man on his return from wanderings have hastened to behold in his halls his children and his wife;	βὰν δὲ παρὰ Κρουνοὺς καὶ Χαλκίδα καλλιρέεθρον. δύσετό τʼ ἠέλιος σκιόωντό τε πᾶσαι ἀγυιαί· ἡ δὲ Φεὰς ἐπέβαλλεν ἐπειγομένη Διὸς οὔρῳ ἠδὲ παρʼ Ἤλιδα δῖαν, ὅθι κρατέουσιν Ἐπειοί. ἔνθεν δʼ αὖ νήσοισιν ἐπιπροέηκε θοῇσιν,
 but thou art not yet minded to know or learn of aught, till thou hast furthermore proved thy wife, who abides as of old in her halls, and ever sorrowfully for her the nights and days wane, as she weeps. But as for me, I never doubted of this, but in my heart	ὁρμαίνων ἤ κεν θάνατον φύγοι ἦ κεν ἁλώῃ. τὼ δʼ αὖτʼ ἐν κλισίῃ Ὀδυσεὺς καὶ δῖος ὑφορβὸς δορπείτην· παρὰ δέ σφιν ἐδόρπεον ἀνέρες ἄλλοι. αὐτὰρ ἐπεὶ πόσιος καὶ ἐδητύος ἐξ ἔρον ἕντο, τοῖς δʼ Ὀδυσεὺς μετέειπε, συβώτεω πειρητίζων,
knew it well, that thou wouldest come home after losing all thy comrades. Yet, thou must know, I was not minded to strive against Poseidon, my father's brother, who laid up wrath in his heart against thee, angered that thou didst blind his dear son. But come, I will shew thee the land of Ithaca , that thou mayest be sure.	ἤ μιν ἔτʼ ἐνδυκέως φιλέοι μεῖναί τε κελεύοι αὐτοῦ ἐνὶ σταθμῷ, ἦ ὀτρύνειε πόλινδε· κέκλυθι νῦν, Εὔμαιε, καὶ ἄλλοι πάντες ἑταῖροι· ἠῶθεν προτὶ ἄστυ λιλαίομαι ἀπονέεσθαι πτωχεύσων, ἵνα μή σε κατατρύχω καὶ ἑταίρους.
 This is the harbor of Phorcys, the old man of the sea, and here at the head of the harbor is the long-leafed olive tree, and near it is the pleasant, shadowy cave, sacred to the nymphs that are called Naiads. This, thou must know, is the vaulted cave in which thou	ἀλλά μοι εὖ θʼ ὑπόθευ καὶ ἅμʼ ἡγεμόνʼ ἐσθλὸν ὄπασσον ὅς κέ με κεῖσʼ ἀγάγῃ· κατὰ δὲ πτόλιν αὐτὸς ἀνάγκῃ πλάγξομαι, αἴ κέν τις κοτύλην καὶ πύρνον ὀρέξῃ. καί κʼ ἐλθὼν πρὸς δώματʼ Ὀδυσσῆος θείοιο ἀγγελίην εἴποιμι περίφρονι Πηνελοπείῃ,
wast wont to offer to the nymphs many hecatombs that bring fulfillment; and yonder is Mount Neriton, clothed with its forests.” So spake the goddess, and scattered the mist, and the land appeared. Glad then was the much-enduring, goodly Odysseus, rejoicing in his own land, and he kissed the earth, the giver of grain.	καί κε μνηστήρεσσιν ὑπερφιάλοισι μιγείην, εἴ μοι δεῖπνον δοῖεν ὀνείατα μυρίʼ ἔχοντες. αἶψά κεν εὖ δρώοιμι μετὰ σφίσιν ἅσσʼ ἐθέλοιεν. ἐκ γάρ τοι ἐρέω, σὺ δὲ σύνθεο καί μευ ἄκουσον· Ἑρμείαο ἕκητι διακτόρου, ὅς ῥά τε πάντων
And straightway he prayed to the nymphs with upstretched hands: “Ye Naiad Nymphs, daughters of Zeus, never did I think to behold you again, but now I hail you with loving prayers. Aye, and gifts too will I give, as aforetime, if the daughter of Zeus, she that drives the spoil, shall graciously grant me	ἀνθρώπων ἔργοισι χάριν καὶ κῦδος ὀπάζει, δρηστοσύνῃ οὐκ ἄν μοι ἐρίσσειε βροτὸς ἄλλος, πῦρ τʼ εὖ νηῆσαι διά τε ξύλα δανὰ κεάσσαι, δαιτρεῦσαί τε καὶ ὀπτῆσαι καὶ οἰνοχοῆσαι, οἷά τε τοῖς ἀγαθοῖσι παραδρώωσι χέρηες.
to live, and shall bring to manhood my dear son.” Then the goddess, flashing-eyed Athena, answered him again: “Be of good cheer, and let not these things distress thy heart. But let us now forthwith set thy goods in the innermost recess of the wondrous cave, where they may abide for thee in safety,	τὸν δὲ μέγʼ ὀχθήσας προσέφης, Εὔμαιε συβῶτα· ὤ μοι, ξεῖνε, τίη τοι ἐνὶ φρεσὶ τοῦτο νόημα ἔπλετο; ἦ σύ γε πάγχυ λιλαίεαι αὐτόθʼ ὀλέσθαι. εἰ δὴ μνηστήρων ἐθέλεις καταδῦναι ὅμιλον, τῶν ὕβρις τε βίη τε σιδήρεον οὐρανὸν ἵκει.
and let us ourselves take thought how all may be far the best.” So saying, the goddess entered the shadowy cave and searched out its hiding-places. And Odysseus brought all the treasure thither, the gold and the stubborn bronze and the finely-wrought raiment, which the Phaeacians gave him.	οὔ τοι τοιοίδʼ εἰσὶν ὑποδρηστῆρες ἐκείνων, ἀλλὰ νέοι, χλαίνας εὖ εἱμένοι ἠδὲ χιτῶνας, αἰεὶ δὲ λιπαροὶ κεφαλὰς καὶ καλὰ πρόσωπα, οἵ σφιν ὑποδρώωσιν· ἐΰξεστοι δὲ τράπεζαι σίτου καὶ κρειῶν ἠδʼ οἴνου βεβρίθασιν.
These things he carefully laid away, and Pallas Athena, daughter of Zeus, who bears the aegis, set a stone at the door. Then the two sat them down by the trunk of the sacred olive tree, and devised death for the insolent wooers. And the goddess, flashing-eyed Athena, was the first to speak, saying:	ἀλλὰ μένʼ· οὐ γάρ τίς τοι ἀνιᾶται παρεόντι, οὔτʼ ἐγὼ οὔτε τις ἄλλος ἑταίρων, οἵ μοι ἔασιν. αὐτὰρ ἐπὴν ἔλθῃσιν Ὀδυσσῆος φίλος υἱός, κεῖνός σε χλαῖνάν τε χιτῶνά τε εἵματα ἕσσει, πέμψει δʼ ὅππη σε κραδίη θυμός τε κελεύει.
offers hopes to all, and has promises for each man, sending them messages, but her mind is set on other things.” Then Odysseus of many wiles answered her, and said: “Lo now, of a surety I was like to have perished in my halls by the evil fate of Agamemnon, son of Atreus,	τὸν δʼ ἠμείβετʼ ἔπειτα πολύτλας δῖος Ὀδυσσεύς· αἴθʼ οὕτως, Εὔμαιε, φίλος Διὶ πατρὶ γένοιο ὡς ἐμοί, ὅττι μʼ ἔπαυσας ἄλης καὶ ὀϊζύος αἰνῆς. πλαγκτοσύνης δʼ οὐκ ἔστι κακώτερον ἄλλο βροτοῖσιν· ἀλλʼ ἕνεκʼ οὐλομένης γαστρὸς κακὰ κήδεʼ ἔχουσιν
hadst not thou, goddess, duly told me all. But come, weave some plan by which I may requite them; and stand thyself by my side, and endue me with dauntless courage, even as when we loosed the bright diadem of Troy . Wouldest thou but stand by my side, thou flashing-eyed one, as eager as thou wast then,	ἀνέρες, ὅν τινʼ ἵκηται ἄλη καὶ πῆμα καὶ ἄλγος. νῦν δʼ ἐπεὶ ἰσχανάᾳς μεῖναι τέ με κεῖνον ἄνωγας, εἴπʼ ἄγε μοι περὶ μητρὸς Ὀδυσσῆος θείοιο πατρός θʼ, ὃν κατέλειπεν ἰὼν ἐπὶ γήραος οὐδῷ, ἤ που ἔτι ζώουσιν ὑπʼ αὐγὰς ἠελίοιο,
I would fight even against three hundred men, with thee, mighty goddess, if with a ready heart thou wouldest give me aid.” Then the goddess, flashing-eyed Athena, answered him: “Yea verily, I will be with thee, and will not forget thee, when we are busied with this work; and methinks many a one	ἦ ἤδη τεθνᾶσι καὶ εἰν Ἀΐδαο δόμοισι. τὸν δʼ αὖτε προσέειπε συβώτης, ὄρχαμος ἀνδρῶν· τοιγὰρ ἐγώ τοι, ξεῖνε, μάλʼ ἀτρεκέως ἀγορεύσω. Λαέρτης μὲν ἔτι ζώει, Διὶ δʼ εὔχεται αἰεὶ θυμὸν ἀπὸ μελέων φθίσθαι οἷς ἐν μεγάροισιν·
 of the wooers that devour thy substance shall bespatter the vast earth with his blood and brains. But come, I will make thee unknown to all mortals. I will shrivel the fair skin on thy supple limbs, and destroy the flaxen hair from off thy head, and clothe thee in a ragged garment,	ἐκπάγλως γὰρ παιδὸς ὀδύρεται οἰχομένοιο κουριδίης τʼ ἀλόχοιο δαΐφρονος, ἥ ἑ μάλιστα ἤκαχʼ ἀποφθιμένη καὶ ἐν ὠμῷ γήραϊ θῆκεν. ἡ δʼ ἄχεϊ οὗ παιδὸς ἀπέφθιτο κυδαλίμοιο, λευγαλέῳ θανάτῳ, ὡς μὴ θάνοι ὅς τις ἐμοί γε
 such that one would shudder to see a man clad therein. And I will dim thy two eyes that were before so beautiful, that thou mayest appear mean in the sight of all the wooers, and of thy wife, and of thy son, whom thou didst leave in thy halls. And for thyself, do thou go first of all	ἐνθάδε ναιετάων φίλος εἴη καὶ φίλα ἔρδοι. ὄφρα μὲν οὖν δὴ κείνη ἔην, ἀχέουσά περ ἔμπης, τόφρα τί μοι φίλον ἔσκε μεταλλῆσαι καὶ ἐρέσθαι, οὕνεκά μʼ αὐτὴ θρέψεν ἅμα Κτιμένῃ τανυπέπλῳ, θυγατέρʼ ἰφθίμῃ, τὴν ὁπλοτάτην τέκε παίδων·
 to the swineherd who keeps thy swine, and withal has a kindly heart towards thee, and loves thy son and constant Penelope. Thou wilt find him abiding by the swine, and they are feeding by the rock of Corax and the spring Arethusa, eating acorns to their heart's content and	τῇ ὁμοῦ ἐτρεφόμην, ὀλίγον δέ τί μʼ ἧσσον ἐτίμα. αὐτὰρ ἐπεί ῥʼ ἥβην πολυήρατον ἱκόμεθʼ ἄμφω, τὴν μὲν ἔπειτα Σάμηνδʼ ἔδοσαν καὶ μυρίʼ ἕλοντο, αὐτὰρ ἐμὲ χλαῖνάν τε χιτῶνά τε εἵματʼ ἐκείνη καλὰ μάλʼ ἀμφιέσασα, ποσὶν δʼ ὑποδήματα δοῦσα
drinking the black water, things which cause the rich flesh of swine to wax fat. There do thou stay, and sitting by his side question him of all things, while I go to Sparta , the land of fair women, to summon thence Telemachus, thy dear son, Odysseus, who went to spacious Lacedaemon to the house of Menelaus,	ἀγρόνδε προΐαλλε· φίλει δέ με κηρόθι μᾶλλον. νῦν δʼ ἤδη τούτων ἐπιδεύομαι· ἀλλά μοι αὐτῷ ἔργον ἀέξουσιν μάκαρες θεοὶ ᾧ ἐπιμίμνω· τῶν ἔφαγόν τʼ ἔπιόν τε καὶ αἰδοίοισιν ἔδωκα. ἐκ δʼ ἄρα δεσποίνης οὐ μείλιχον ἔστιν ἀκοῦσαι
to seek tidings of thee, if thou wast still anywhere alive.” Then Odysseus of many wiles answered her: “Why then, I pray thee, didst thou not tell him, thou whose mind knows all things? Nay, was it haply that he too might suffer woes, wandering over the unresting sea, and that others might devour his substance?”	οὔτʼ ἔπος οὔτε τι ἔργον, ἐπεὶ κακὸν ἔμπεσεν οἴκῳ, ἄνδρες ὑπερφίαλοι· μέγα δὲ δμῶες χατέουσιν ἀντία δεσποίνης φάσθαι καὶ ἕκαστα πυθέσθαι καὶ φαγέμεν πιέμεν τε, ἔπειτα δὲ καί τι φέρεσθαι ἀγρόνδʼ, οἷά τε θυμὸν ἀεὶ δμώεσσιν ἰαίνει.
Truly young men in a black ship lie in wait for him, eager to slay him before he comes to his native land, but methinks this shall not be. Ere that shall the earth cover many a one of the wooers that devour thy substance.” So saying, Athena touched him with her wand.	τὸν δʼ ἀπαμειβόμενος προσέφη πολύμητις Ὀδυσσεύς· ὢ πόποι, ὡς ἄρα τυτθὸς ἐών, Εὔμαιε συβῶτα, πολλὸν ἀπεπλάγχθης σῆς πατρίδος ἠδὲ τοκήων. ἀλλʼ ἄγε μοι τόδε εἰπὲ καὶ ἀτρεκέως κατάλεξον, ἠὲ διεπράθετο πτόλις ἀνδρῶν εὐρυάγυια,
 She withered the fair flesh on his supple limbs, and destroyed the flaxen hair from off his head, and about all his limbs she put the skin of an aged old man. And she dimmed his two eyes that were before so beautiful, and clothed him in other raiment,	ᾗ ἔνι ναιετάασκε πατὴρ καὶ πότνια μήτηρ, ἦ σέ γε μουνωθέντα παρʼ οἴεσιν ἢ παρὰ βουσὶν ἄνδρες δυσμενέες νηυσὶν λάβον ἠδʼ ἐπέρασσαν τοῦδʼ ἀνδρὸς πρὸς δώμαθʼ, ὁ δʼ ἄξιον ὦνον ἔδωκε. τὸν δʼ αὖτε προσέειπε συβώτης, ὄρχαμος ἀνδρῶν·
a vile ragged cloak and a tunic, tattered garments and foul, begrimed with filthy smoke. And about him she cast the great skin of a swift hind, stripped of the hair, and she gave him a staff, and a miserable wallet, full of holes, slung by a twisted cord. So when the two had thus taken counsel together, they parted; and thereupon the goddess	ξεῖνʼ, ἐπεὶ ἂρ δὴ ταῦτά μʼ ἀνείρεαι ἠδὲ μεταλλᾷς, σιγῇ νῦν ξυνίει καὶ τέρπεο, πῖνέ τε οἶνον ἥμενος. αἵδε δὲ νύκτες ἀθέσφατοι· ἔστι μὲν εὕδειν, ἔστι δὲ τερπομένοισιν ἀκούειν· οὐδέ τί σε χρή, πρὶν ὥρη, καταλέχθαι· ἀνίη καὶ πολὺς ὕπνος.
went to goodly Lacedaemon to fetch the son of Odysseus.	τῶν δʼ ἄλλων ὅτινα κραδίη καὶ θυμὸς ἀνώγει, εὑδέτω ἐξελθών· ἅμα δʼ ἠοῖ φαινομένηφι δειπνήσας ἅμʼ ὕεσσιν ἀνακτορίῃσιν ἑπέσθω. νῶϊ δʼ ἐνὶ κλισίῃ πίνοντέ τε δαινυμένω τε κήδεσιν ἀλλήλων τερπώμεθα λευγαλέοισι,
But Odysseus went forth from the harbor by the rough path up over the woodland and through the heights to the place where Athena had shewed him that he should find the goodly swineherd, who cared for his substance above all the slaves that goodly Odysseus had gotten. He found him sitting in the fore-hall of his house, where his court was built high in a place of wide outlook, a great and goodly court with an open space around it. This the swineherd had himself built for the swine of his master, that was gone, without the knowledge of his mistress and the old man Laertes. With huge stones had he built it, and set on it a coping of thorn. Without he had driven stakes the whole length, this way and that, huge stakes, set close together, which he had made by splitting an oak to the black core; and within the court he had made twelve sties close by one another, as beds for the swine, and in each one were penned fifty wallowing swine, females for breeding; but the boars slept without. These were far fewer in numbers, for on them the godlike wooers feasted, and lessened them, for the swineherd ever sent in the best of all the fatted hogs, which numbered three hundred and sixty. By these ever slept four dogs, savage as wild beasts, which the swineherd had reared, a leader of men. But he himself was fitting boots about his feet, cutting an ox-hide of good color, while the others had gone, three of them, one here one there, with the droves of swine; and the fourth he had sent to the city to drive perforce a boar to the insolent wooers, that they might slay it and satisfy their souls with meat. Suddenly then the baying hounds caught sight of Odysseus, and rushed upon him with loud barking, but Odysseus sat down in his cunning, and the staff fell from his hand. Then even in his own farmstead would he have suffered cruel hurt, but the swineherd with swift steps followed after them, and hastened through the gateway, and the hide fell from his hand. He called aloud to the dogs, and drove them this way and that with a shower of stones, and spoke to his master, and said: “Old man, verily the dogs were like to have torn thee to pieces all of a sudden, and on me thou wouldest have shed reproach. Aye, and the gods have given me other griefs and sorrow. It is for a godlike master that I mourn and grieve, as I abide here, and rear fat swine for other men to eat, while he haply in want of food wanders over the land and city of men of strange speech, if indeed he still lives and sees the light of the sun. But come with me, let us go to the hut, old man, that when thou hast satisfied thy heart with food and wine, thou too mayest tell whence thou art, and all the woes thou hast endured.” So saying, the goodly swineherd led him to the hut, and brought him in, and made him sit, strowing beneath thick brushwood, and thereon spreading the skin of a shaggy wild goat, large and hairy, on which he was himself wont to sleep. And Odysseus was glad that he gave him such welcome, and spoke, and addressed him: “Stranger, may Zeus and the other immortal gods grant thee what most thou desirest, since thou with a ready heart hast given me welcome.” To him then, swineherd Eumaeus, didst thou make answer, and say: “Nay, stranger, it were not right for me, even though one meaner than thou were to come, to slight a stranger: for from Zeus are all strangers and beggars, and a gift, though small, is welcome from such as we; since this is the lot of slaves, ever in fear when over them as lords their masters hold sway—young masters such as ours. For verily the gods have stayed the return of him who would have loved me with all kindness, and would have given me possessions of my own, a house and a bit of land, and a wife, sought of many wooers, even such things as a kindly master gives to his thrall who has toiled much for him, and whose labour the god makes to prosper, even as this work of mine prospers, to which I give heed. Therefore would my master have richly rewarded me, if he had grown old here at home: but he perished—as I would all the kindred of Helen had perished in utter ruin, since she loosened the knees of many warriors. For he too went forth to win recompense for Agamemnon to Ilios , famed for its horses, that he might fight with the Trojans.” So saying, he quickly bound up his tunic with his belt, and went to the sties, where the tribes of swine were penned. Choosing two from thence, he brought them in and slew them both, and singed, and cut them up, and spitted them. Then, when he had roasted all, he brought and set it before Odysseus, hot upon the spits, and sprinkled over it white barley meal. Then in a bowl of ivy wood he mixed honey-sweet wine, and himself sat down over against Odysseus, and bade him to his food, and said: “Eat now, stranger, such food as slaves have to offer, meat of young pigs; the fatted hogs the wooers eat, who reck not in their hearts of the wrath of the gods, nor have any pity. Verily the blessed gods love not reckless deeds, but they honor justice and the righteous deeds of men. Even cruel foemen that set foot on the land of others, and Zeus gives them booty, and they fill their ships and depart for home—even on the hearts of these falls great fear of the wrath of the gods. But these men here, look you, know somewhat, and have heard some voice of a god regarding my master's pitiful death, seeing that they will not woo righteously, nor go back to their own, but at their ease they waste our substance in insolent wise, and there is no sparing. For every day and night that comes from Zeus they sacrifice not one victim nor two alone, and they draw forth wine, and waste it in insolent wise. Verily his substance was great past telling, so much has no lord either on the dark mainland or in Ithaca itself; nay, not twenty men together have wealth so great. Lo, I will tell thee the tale thereof; twelve herds of kine has he on the mainland; as many flocks of sheep; as many droves of swine; as many packed herds of goats do herdsmen, both foreigners and of his own people, pasture. And here too graze roving herds of goats on the borders of the island, eleven in all, and over them trusty men keep watch. And each man of these ever drives up day by day one of his flock for the wooers, even that one of the fatted goats which seems to him the best. But as for me, I guard and keep these swine, and choose out with care and send them the best of the boars.” So he spoke, but Odysseus eagerly ate flesh and drank wine, greedily, in silence, and was sowing the seeds of evil for the wooers. But when he had dined, and satisfied his soul with food, then the swineherd filled the bowl from which he was himself wont to drink, and gave it him brim full of wine, and he took it, and was glad at heart; and he spoke, and addressed him with winged words: “Friend, who was it who bought thee with his wealth, a man so very rich and mighty, as thou tellest? Thou saidest that he died to win recompense for Agamemnon; tell me, if haply I may know him, being such an one. For Zeus, I ween, and the other immortal gods know whether I have seen him, and could bring tidings; for I have wandered far.” Then the swineherd, a leader of men, answered him: “Old man, no wanderer that came and brought tidings of him could persuade his wife and his dear son; nay, at random, when they have need of entertainment, do vagabonds lie, and are not minded to speak the truth. Whosoever in his wanderings comes to the land of Ithaca , goes to my mistress and tells a deceitful tale. And she, receiving him kindly, gives him entertainment, and questions him of all things, and the tears fall from her eyelids, while she weeps, as is the way of a woman, when her husband dies afar. And readily wouldest thou too, old man, fashion a story, if one would give thee a cloak and a tunic for raiment. But as for him, ere now dogs and swift birds are like to have torn the flesh from his bones, and his spirit has left him; or in the sea fishes have eaten him, and his bones lie there on the shore, wrapped in deep sand. Thus has he perished yonder, and to his friends grief is appointed for days to come, to all, but most of all to me. For never again shall I find a master so kind, how far soever I go, not though I come again to the house of my father and mother, where at the first I was born, and they reared me themselves. Yet it is not for them that I henceforth mourn so much, eager though I am to behold them with my eyes and to be in my native land; nay, it is longing for Odysseus, who is gone, that seizes me. His name, stranger, absent though he is, I speak with awe, for greatly did he love me and care for me at heart; but I call him my lord beloved, for all he is not here.” Then the much-enduring, goodly Odysseus answered him: “Friend, since thou dost utterly make denial, and declarest that he will never come again, and thy heart is ever unbelieving, therefore will I tell thee, not at random but with an oath, that Odysseus shall return. And let me have a reward for bearing good tidings, as soon as he shall come, and reach his home; clothe me in a cloak and tunic, goodly raiment. But ere that, how sore soever my need, I will accept naught; for hateful in my eyes as the gates of Hades is that man, who, yielding to stress of poverty, tells a deceitful tale. Now be my witness Zeus, above all gods, and this hospitable board, and the hearth of noble Odysseus to which I am come, that verily all these things shall be brought to pass even as I tell thee. In the course of this self-same day Odysseus shall come hither, as the old moon wanes, and the new appears. He shall return, and take vengeance on all those who here dishonor his wife and his glorious son.” To him then, swineherd Eumaeus, didst thou make answer, and say: “Old man, neither shall I, meseems, pay thee this reward for bearing good tidings, nor shall Odysseus ever come to his home. Nay, drink in peace, and let us turn our thoughts to other things, and do not thou recall this to my mind; for verily the heart in my breast is grieved whenever any one makes mention of my good master. But as for thy oath, we will let it be; yet I would that Odysseus might come, even as I desire, I, and Penelope, and the old man Laertes, and godlike Telemachus. But now it is for his son that I grieve unceasingly, even for Telemachus, whom Odysseus begot. When the gods had made him grow like a sapling, and I thought that he would be among men no whit worse than his dear father, glorious in form and comeliness, then some one of the immortals marred the wise spirit within him, or haply some man, and he went to sacred Pylos after tidings of his father. For him now the lordly wooers lie in wait on his homeward way, that the race of godlike Arceisius may perish out of Ithaca , and leave no name. But verily we will let him be; he may be taken, or he may escape, and the son of Cronos stretch forth his hand to guard him. But come, do thou, old man, tell me of thine own sorrows, and declare me this truly, that I may know full well. Who art thou among men, and from whence? Where is thy city, and where thy parents? On what manner of ship didst thou come, and how did sailors bring thee to Ithaca ? Who did they declare themselves to be? For nowise, methinks, didst thou come hither on foot.” Then Odysseus of many wiles answered him, and said: “Then verily I will frankly tell thee all. Would that now we two might have food and sweet wine for the while, to feast on in quiet here in thy hut, and that others might go about their work; easily then might I tell on for a full year, and yet in no wise finish the tale of the woes of my spirit—even all the toils that I have endured by the will of the gods. “From broad Crete I declare that I am come by lineage, the son of a wealthy man. And many other sons too were born and bred in his halls, true sons of a lawful wife; but the mother that bore me was bought, a concubine. Yet Castor, son of Hylax, of whom I declare that I am sprung, honored me even as his true-born sons. He was at that time honored as a god among the Cretans in the land for his good estate, and his wealth, and his glorious sons. But the fates of death bore him away to the house of Hades, and his proud sons divided among them his substance, and cast lots therefor. To me they gave a very small portion, and allotted a dwelling. But I took unto me a wife from a house that had wide possessions, winning her by my valor; for I was no weakling, nor a coward in fight. Now all that strength is gone; yet even so, in seeing the stubble, methinks thou mayest judge what the grain was; for verily troubles in full measure encompass me. But then Ares and Athena gave me courage, and strength that breaks the ranks of men; and whenever I picked the best warriors for an ambush, sowing the seeds of evil for the foe, never did my proud spirit forbode death, but ever far the first did I leap forth, and slay with my spear whosoever of the foe gave way in flight before me. Such a man was I in war, but labour in the field was never to my liking, nor the care of a household, which rears goodly children, but oared ships were ever dear to me, and wars, and polished spears, and arrows,—grievous things, whereat others are wont to shudder. But those things, I ween, were dear to me, which a god put in my heart; for different men take joy in different works. For before the sons of the Achaeans set foot on the land of Troy , I had nine times led warriors and swift-faring ships against foreign folk, and great spoil had ever fallen to my hands. Of this I would choose what pleased my mind, and much I afterwards obtained by lot. Thus my house straightway grew rich, and thereafter I became one feared and honored among the Cretans. “But when Zeus, whose voice is borne afar, devised that hateful journey which loosened the knees of many a warrior, then they bade me and glorious Idomeneus to lead the ships to Ilios , nor was there any way to refuse, for the voice of the people pressed hard upon us. There for nine years we sons of the Achaeans warred, and in the tenth we sacked the city of Priam, and set out for home in our ships, and a god scattered the Achaeans. But for me, wretched man that I was, Zeus, the counsellor, devised evil. For a month only I remained, taking joy in my children, my wedded wife, and my wealth; and then to Egypt did my spirit bid me voyage with my godlike comrades, when I had fitted out my ships with care. Nine ships I fitted out, and the host gathered speedily. Then for six days my trusty comrades feasted, and I gave them many victims, that they might sacrifice to the gods, and prepare a feast for themselves; and on the seventh we embarked and set sail from broad Crete , with the North Wind blowing fresh and fair, and ran on easily as if down stream. No harm came to any of my ships, but free from scathe and from disease we sat, and the wind and the helmsman guided the ships. “On the fifth day we came to fair-flowing Aegyptus , and in the river Aegyptus I moored my curved ships. Then verily I bade my trusty comrades to remain there by the ships, and to guard the ships, and I sent out scouts to go to places of outlook. But my comrades, yielding to wantonness, and led on by their own might, straightway set about wasting the fair fields of the men of Egypt ; and they carried off the women and little children, and slew the men; and the cry came quickly to the city. Then, hearing the shouting, the people came forth at break of day, and the whole plain was filled with footmen, and chariots and the flashing of bronze. But Zeus who hurls the thunderbolt cast an evil panic upon my comrades, and none had the courage to hold his ground and face the foe; for evil surrounded us on every side. So then they slew many of us with the sharp bronze, and others they led up to their city alive, to work for them perforce. But in my heart Zeus himself put this thought—I would that I had rather died and met my fate there in Egypt , for still was sorrow to give me welcome. Straightway I put off from my head my well-wrought helmet, and the shield from off my shoulders, and let the spear fall from my hand, and went toward the chariot horses of the king. I clasped, and kissed his knees, and he delivered me, and took pity on me, and, setting me in his chariot, took me weeping to his home. Verily full many rushed upon me with their ashen spears, eager to slay me, for they were exceeding angry. But he warded them off, and had regard for the wrath of Zeus, the stranger's god, who above all others hath indignation at evil deeds. “There then I stayed seven years, and much wealth did I gather among the Egyptians, for all men gave me gifts. But when the eighth circling year was come, then there came a man of Phoenicia , well versed in guile, a greedy knave, who had already wrought much evil among men. He prevailed upon me by his cunning, and took me with him, until we reached Phoenicia , where lay his house and his possessions. There I remained with him for a full year. But when at length the months and the days were being brought to fulfillment, as the year rolled round and the seasons came on, he set me on a seafaring ship bound for Libya , having given lying counsel to the end that I should convey a cargo with him, but in truth that, when there, he might sell me and get a vast price. So I went with him on board the ship, suspecting his guile, yet perforce. And she ran before the North Wind, blowing fresh and fair, on a mid-sea course to the windward of Crete , and Zeus devised destruction for the men. But when we had left Crete , and no other land appeared, but only sky and sea, then verily the son of Cronos set a black cloud above the hollow ship, and the sea grew dark beneath it. Therewith Zeus thundered, and hurled his bolt upon the ship, and she quivered from stem to stern, smitten by the bolt of Zeus, and was filled with sulphurous smoke, and all the crew fell from out the ship. Like sea-crows they were borne on the waves about the black ship, and the god took from them their returning. But as for me, Zeus himself when my heart was compassed with woe, put into my hands the tossing mast of the dark-prowed ship, that I might again escape destruction. Around this I clung, and was borne by the direful winds. For nine days I was borne, but on the tenth black night the great rolling wave brought me to the land of the Thesprotians. There the king of the Thesprotians, lord Pheidon, took me in, and asked no ransom, for his dear son came upon me, overcome as I was with cold and weariness, and raised me by the hand, and led me until he came to his father's palace; and he clothed me in a cloak and tunic, as raiment. “There I learned of Odysseus, for the king said that he had entertained him, and given him welcome on his way to his native land. And he showed me all the treasure that Odysseus had gathered, bronze, and gold, and iron, wrought with toil; verily unto the tenth generation would it feed his children after him, so great was the wealth that lay stored for him in the halls of the king. But Odysseus, he said, had gone to Dodona , to hear the will of Zeus from the high-crested oak of the god, even how he might return to the rich land of Ithaca after so long an absence, whether openly or in secret. And moreover he swore in my own presence, as he poured libations in his house, that the ship was launched, and the men ready, who were to convey him to his dear native land. But me he sent forth first, for a ship of the Thesprotians chanced to be setting out for Dulichium, rich in wheat. Thither he bade them to convey me with kindly care, to king Acastus. But an evil counsel regarding me found favour in their hearts, that I might even yet be brought into utter misery. When the sea-faring ship had sailed far from the land, they presently sought to bring about for me the day of slavery. They stripped me of my garments, my cloak and tunic, and clothed me in other raiment, a vile ragged cloak and tunic, even the tattered garments which thou seest before thine eyes; and at evening they reached the tilled fields of clear-seen Ithaca . Then with a twisted rope they bound me fast in the benched ship, and themselves went ashore, and made haste to take their supper by the shore of the sea. But as for me, the gods themselves undid my bonds full easily, and, wrapping the tattered cloak about my head, I slid down the smooth lading-plank, and brought my breast to the sea, and then struck out with both hands, and swam, and very soon was out of the water, and away from them. Then I went up to a place where there was a thicket of leafy wood, and lay there crouching. And they went hither and thither with loud cries; but as there seemed to be no profit in going further in their search, they went back again on board their hollow ship. And the gods themselves hid me easily, and led me, and brought me to the farmstead of a wise man; for still haply it is my lot to live.” To him then, swineherd Eumaeus, didst thou make answer, and say: “Ah, wretched stranger, verily thou hast stirred my heart deeply in telling all the tale of thy sufferings and thy wanderings. But in this, methinks, thou hast not spoken aright, nor shalt thou persuade me with thy tale about Odysseus. Why shouldst thou, who art in such plight lie to no purpose? Nay, of myself I know well regarding the return of my master, that he was utterly hated of all the gods, in that they did not slay him among the Trojans, or in the arms of his friends, when he had wound up the skein of war. Then would the whole host of the Achaeans have made him a tomb, and for his son too he would have won great glory in days to come. But as it is the spirits of the storm have swept him away, and left no tidings. I, for my part, dwell aloof with the swine, nor do I go to the city, unless haply wise Penelope bids me thither, when tidings come to her from anywhere. Then men sit around him that comes, and question him closely, both those that grieve for their lord, that has long been gone, and those who rejoice, as they devour his substance without atonement. But I care not to ask or enquire, since the time when an Aetolian beguiled me with his story, one that had killed a man, and after wandering over the wide earth came to my house, and I gave him kindly welcome. He said that he had seen Odysseus among the Cretans at the house of Idomeneus, mending his ships which storms had shattered. And he said that he would come either by summer or by harvest-time, bringing much treasure along with his godlike comrades. Thou too, old man of many sorrows, since a god has brought thee to me, seek not to win my favour by lies, nor in any wise to cajole me. It is not for this that I shall shew thee respect or kindness, but from fear of Zeus, the stranger's god, and from pity for thyself.” Then Odysseus of many wiles answered him, and said: “Verily thou hast in thy bosom a heart that is slow to believe, seeing that in such wise, even with an oath, I won thee not, neither persuade thee. But come now, let us make a covenant, and the gods who hold Olympus shall be witnesses for us both in time to come. If thy master returns to this house, clothe me in a cloak and tunic, as raiment, and send me on my way to Dulichium, where I desire to be. But if thy master does not come as I say, set the slaves upon me, and fling me down from a great cliff, that another beggar may beware of deceiving.” And the goodly swineherd answered him, and said: “Aye, stranger, so should I indeed win fair fame and prosperity among men both now and hereafter, if I, who brought thee to my hut and gave thee entertainment, should then slay thee, and take away thy dear life. With a ready heart thereafter should I pray to Zeus, son of Cronos. But it is now time for supper, and may my comrades soon be here, that we may make ready a savoury supper in the hut.” Thus they spoke to one another, and the swine and the swineherds drew near. The sows they shut up to sleep in their wonted sties, and a wondrous noise arose from them, as they were penned. Then the goodly swineherd called to his comrades saying: “Bring forth the best of the boars, that I may slaughter him for the stranger who comes from afar, and we too shall have some profit therefrom, who have long borne toil and suffering for the sake of the white-tusked swine, while others devour our labour without atonement.” So saying, he split wood with the pitiless bronze, and the others brought in a fatted boar of five years old, and set him by the hearth. Nor did the swineherd forget the immortals, for he had an understanding heart, but as a first offering he cast into the fire bristles from the head of the white-tusked boar, and made prayer to all the gods that wise Odysseus might return to his own house. Then he raised himself up, and smote the boar with a billet of oak, which he had left when splitting the wood, and the boar's life left him. And the others cut the boar's throat, and signed him, and quickly cut him up, and the swineherd took as first offerings bits of raw flesh from all the limbs, and laid them in the rich fat. These he cast into the fire, when he had sprinkled them with barley meal, but the rest they cut up and spitted, and roasted it carefully, and drew it all off the spits, and cast it in a heap on platters. Then the swineherd stood up to carve, for well did his heart know what was fair, and he cut up the mess and divided it into seven portions. One with a prayer he set aside for the nymphs and for Hermes, son of Maia , and the rest he distributed to each. And Odysseus he honored with the long chine of the white-tusked boar, and made glad the heart of his master; and Odysseus of many wiles spoke to him, and said: “Eumaeus, mayest thou be as dear to father Zeus as thou art to me, since thou honourest me with a good portion, albeit I am in such plight.” To him then, swineherd Eumaeus, didst thou make answer, and say: “Eat, unhappy stranger, and have joy of such fare as is here. It is the god that will give one thing and withhold another, even as seems good to his heart; for he can do all things.” He spoke, and sacrificed the firstling pieces to the gods that are for ever, and, when he had made libations of the flaming wine, he placed the cup in the hands of Odysseus, the sacker of cities, and took his seat by his own portion. And bread was served to them by Mesaulius, whom the swineherd had gotten by himself alone, while his master was gone, without the knowledge of his mistress or the old Laertes, buying him of the Taphians with his own goods. So they put forth their hands to the good cheer lying ready before them. But when they had put from them the desire of food and drink, Mesaulius took away the food, and they were fain to go to their rest, sated with bread and meat. Now the night came on, foul and without a moon, and Zeus rained the whole night through, and the West Wind, ever the rainy wind, blew strong. Then Odysseus spoke among them, making trial of the swineherd, to see whether he would strip off his own cloak and give it him, or bid some other of his comrades to do so, since he cared for him so greatly: “Hear me now, Eumaeus and all the rest of you, his men, with a wish in my heart will I tell a tale; for the wine bids me, befooling wine, which sets one, even though he be right wise, to singing	οὔ τι περιπληθὴς λίην τόσον, ἀλλʼ ἀγαθὴ μέν, εὔβοτος, εὔμηλος, οἰνοπληθής, πολύπυρος. πείνη δʼ οὔ ποτε δῆμον ἐσέρχεται, οὐδέ τις ἄλλη νοῦσος ἐπὶ στυγερὴ πέλεται δειλοῖσι βροτοῖσιν· ἀλλʼ ὅτε γηράσκωσι πόλιν κάτα φῦλʼ ἀνθρώπων,
and laughing softly, and makes him stand up and dance, aye, and brings forth a word which were better unspoken. Still, since I have once spoken out, I will hide nothing. Would that I were young and my strength firm as when we made ready our ambush, and led it beneath the walls of Troy . The leaders were Odysseus and Menelaus, son of Atreus, and with them I was third in command; for so had they ordered it themselves. Now when we had come to the city and the steep wall, round about the town in the thick brushwood among the needs and swamp-land	ἐλθὼν ἀργυρότοξος Ἀπόλλων Ἀρτέμιδι ξὺν οἷς ἀγανοῖς βελέεσσιν ἐποιχόμενος κατέπεφνεν. ἔνθα δύω πόλιες, δίχα δέ σφισι πάντα δέδασται· τῇσιν δʼ ἀμφοτέρῃσι πατὴρ ἐμὸς ἐμβασίλευε, Κτήσιος Ὀρμενίδης, ἐπιείκελος ἀθανάτοισιν.
 quickly, and from him flung his purple cloak, and set out to run to the ships. Then in his garment I gladly lay, and golden-throned Dawn appeared. Would that I were young as then, and my strength as firm; then would one of the swineherds in the farmstead give me a cloak	ἔνθα δὲ Φοίνικες ναυσίκλυτοι ἤλυθον ἄνδρες, τρῶκται, μυρίʼ ἄγοντες ἀθύρματα νηῒ μελαίνῃ. ἔσκε δὲ πατρὸς ἐμοῖο γυνὴ Φοίνισσʼ ἐνὶ οἴκῳ, καλή τε μεγάλη τε καὶ ἀγλαὰ ἔργα ἰδυῖα· τὴν δʼ ἄρα Φοίνικες πολυπαίπαλοι ἠπερόπευον.
both from kindness and from respect for a brave warrior. But as it is they scorn me, since I have foul raiment about me.” To him then, swineherd Eumaeus, didst thou make answer, and say: “Old man, the tale thou hast told is a good one, nor hast thou thus far spoken aught amiss or unprofitably. Wherefore thou shalt lack neither clothing nor aught else that a sore-tried suppliant should receive, when he meets one—for this night at least; but in the morning thou shalt shake about thee those rags of thine. For not many cloaks are here or changes of tunics to put on, but each man has one alone. But when the dear son of Odysseus comes, he will himself give thee a cloak and a tunic as raiment, and will send thee whithersoever thy heart and spirit bid thee go.” So saying, he sprang up and placed a bed for Odysseus near the fire, and cast upon it skins of sheep and goats. There Odysseus lay down, and the swineherd threw over him a great thick cloak, which he kept at hand for a change of clothing whenever a terrible storm should arise. So there Odysseus slept, and beside him slept the young men. But the swineherd	πλυνούσῃ τις πρῶτα μίγη κοίλῃ παρὰ νηῒ εὐνῇ καὶ φιλότητι, τά τε φρένας ἠπεροπεύει θηλυτέρῃσι γυναιξί, καὶ ἥ κʼ εὐεργὸς ἔῃσιν. εἰρώτα δὴ ἔπειτα τίς εἴη καὶ πόθεν ἔλθοι· ἡ δὲ μάλʼ αὐτίκα πατρὸς ἐπέφραδεν ὑψερεφὲς δῶ·
liked not a bed in that place, that he should lay him down away from the boars; so he made ready to go outside. And Odysseus was glad that he took such care of his master's substance while he was afar. First Eumaeus flung his sharp sword over his strong shoulders, and then put about him a cloak, very thick, to keep off the wind; and he picked up the fleece of a large, well-fatted goat, took a sharp javelin to ward off dogs and men, and went forth to lie down to sleep where the white-tusked boars slept beneath a hollow rock, in a place sheltered from the North Wind.	ἐκ μὲν Σιδῶνος πολυχάλκου εὔχομαι εἶναι, κούρη δʼ εἴμʼ Ἀρύβαντος ἐγὼ ῥυδὸν ἀφνειοῖο· ἀλλά μʼ ἀνήρπαξαν Τάφιοι ληΐστορες ἄνδρες ἀγρόθεν ἐρχομένην, πέρασαν δέ τε δεῦρʼ ἀγαγόντες τοῦδʼ ἀνδρὸς πρὸς δώμαθʼ· ὁ δʼ ἄξιον ὦνον ἔδωκε.
But Pallas Athena went to spacious Lacedaemon to remind the glorious son of great-hearted Odysseus of his return, and to hasten his coming. She found Telemachus and the noble son of Nestor	εἴη κεν καὶ τοῦτʼ, εἴ μοι ἐθέλοιτέ γε, ναῦται, ὅρκῳ πιστωθῆναι ἀπήμονά μʼ οἴκαδʼ ἀπάξειν. ὣς ἔφαθʼ, οἱ δʼ ἄρα πάντες ἐπώμνυον ὡς ἐκέλευεν. αὐτὰρ ἐπεί ῥʼ ὄμοσάν τε τελεύτησάν τε τὸν ὅρκον, τοῖς δʼ αὖτις μετέειπε γυνὴ καὶ ἀμείβετο μύθῳ·
lying in the fore-hall of the palace of glorious Menelaus. Now Nestor's son was overcome with soft sleep, but sweet sleep did not hold Telemachus, but all through the immortal night anxious thoughts for his father kept him wakeful. And flashing-eyed Athena stood near him, and said:	σιγῇ νῦν, μή τίς με προσαυδάτω ἐπέεσσιν ὑμετέρων ἑτάρων, ξυμβλήμενος ἢ ἐν ἀγυιῇ, ἤ που ἐπὶ κρήνῃ· μή τις ποτὶ δῶμα γέροντι ἐλθὼν ἐξείπῃ, ὁ δʼ ὀϊσάμενος καταδήσῃ δεσμῷ ἐν ἀργαλέῳ, ὑμῖν δʼ ἐπιφράσσετʼ ὄλεθρον.
 “Telemachus, thou dost not well to wander longer far from thy home, leaving behind thee thy wealth and men in thy house so insolent, lest they divide and devour all thy possessions, and thou shalt have gone on a fruitless journey. Nay, rouse with all speed Menelaus, good at the war-cry,	ἀλλʼ ἔχετʼ ἐν φρεσὶ μῦθον, ἐπείγετε δʼ ὦνον ὁδαίων. ἀλλʼ ὅτε κεν δὴ νηῦς πλείη βιότοιο γένηται, ἀγγελίη μοι ἔπειτα θοῶς ἐς δώμαθʼ ἱκέσθω· οἴσω γὰρ καὶ χρυσόν, ὅτις χʼ ὑποχείριος ἔλθῃ· καὶ δέ κεν ἄλλʼ ἐπίβαθρον ἐγὼν ἐθέλουσά γε δοίην.
 to send thee on thy way, that thou mayest find thy noble mother still in her home. For now her father and her brothers bid her wed Eurymachus, for he surpasses all the wooers in his presents, and has increased his gifts of wooing. Beware lest she carry forth from thy halls some treasure against thy will.	παῖδα γὰρ ἀνδρὸς ἑῆος ἐνὶ μεγάροις ἀτιτάλλω, κερδαλέον δὴ τοῖον, ἅμα τροχόωντα θύραζε· τόν κεν ἄγοιμʼ ἐπὶ νηός, ὁ δʼ ὑμῖν μυρίον ὦνον ἄλφοι, ὅπῃ περάσητε κατʼ ἀλλοθρόους ἀνθρώπους. ἡ μὲν ἄρʼ ὣς εἰποῦσʼ ἀπέβη πρὸς δώματα καλά,
 For thou knowest what sort of a spirit there is in a woman's breast; she is fain to increase the house of the man who weds her, but of her former children and of the lord of her youth she takes no thought, when once he is dead, and asks no longer concerning them. Nay, go, and thyself put all thy possessions in the charge of whatsoever one	οἱ δʼ ἐνιαυτὸν ἅπαντα παρʼ ἡμῖν αὖθι μένοντες ἐν νηῒ γλαφυρῇ βίοτον πολὺν ἐμπολόωντο. ἀλλʼ ὅτε δὴ κοίλη νηῦς ἤχθετο τοῖσι νέεσθαι, καὶ τότʼ ἄρʼ ἄγγελον ἧκαν, ὃς ἀγγείλειε γυναικί. ἤλυθʼ ἀνὴρ πολύϊδρις ἐμοῦ πρὸς δώματα πατρὸς
of the handmaids seems to thee the best, until the gods shall show thee a noble bride. And another thing will I tell thee, and do thou lay it to heart. The best men of the wooers lie in wait for thee of set purpose in the strait between Ithaca and rugged Samos ,	χρύσεον ὅρμον ἔχων, μετὰ δʼ ἠλέκτροισιν ἔερτο. τὸν μὲν ἄρʼ ἐν μεγάρῳ δμῳαὶ καὶ πότνια μήτηρ χερσίν τʼ ἀμφαφόωντο καὶ ὀφθαλμοῖσιν ὁρῶντο, ὦνον ὑπισχόμεναι· ὁ δὲ τῇ κατένευσε σιωπῇ. ἦ τοι ὁ καννεύσας κοίλην ἐπὶ νῆα βεβήκει,
 eager to slay thee before thou comest to thy native land. But methinks this shall not be; ere that shall the earth cover many a one of the wooers that devour thy substance. But do thou keep thy well-built ship far from the islands, and sail by night as well as by day, and that	ἡ δʼ ἐμὲ χειρὸς ἑλοῦσα δόμων ἐξῆγε θύραζε. εὗρε δʼ ἐνὶ προδόμῳ ἠμὲν δέπα ἠδὲ τραπέζας ἀνδρῶν δαιτυμόνων, οἵ μευ πατέρʼ ἀμφεπένοντο. οἱ μὲν ἄρʼ ἐς θῶκον πρόμολον, δήμοιό τε φῆμιν, ἡ δʼ αἶψα τρίʼ ἄλεισα κατακρύψασʼ ὑπὸ κόλπῳ
one of the immortals, who keeps and guards thee, will send a fair breeze in thy wake. But when thou hast reached the nearest shore of Ithaca , send thy ship and all thy comrades on to the city, but thyself go first of all to the swineherd who keeps thy swine, and withal has a kindly heart toward thee.	ἔκφερεν· αὐτὰρ ἐγὼν ἑπόμην ἀεσιφροσύνῃσι. δύσετό τʼ ἠέλιος, σκιόωντό τε πᾶσαι ἀγυιαί· ἡμεῖς δʼ ἐς λιμένα κλυτὸν ἤλθομεν ὦκα κιόντες, ἔνθʼ ἄρα Φοινίκων ἀνδρῶν ἦν ὠκύαλος νηῦς. οἱ μὲν ἔπειτʼ ἀναβάντες ἐπέπλεον ὑγρὰ κέλευθα,
There do thou spend the night, and bid him to go to the city to bear word to wise Penelope that she has thee safe, and thou art come from Pylos .” So saying, she departed to high Olympus . But Telemachus woke the son of Nestor out of sweet sleep,	νὼ ἀναβησάμενοι· ἐπὶ δὲ Ζεὺς οὖρον ἴαλλεν. ἑξῆμαρ μὲν ὁμῶς πλέομεν νύκτας τε καὶ ἦμαρ· ἀλλʼ ὅτε δὴ ἕβδομον ἦμαρ ἐπὶ Ζεὺς θῆκε Κρονίων, τὴν μὲν ἔπειτα γυναῖκα βάλʼ Ἄρτεμις ἰοχέαιρα, ἄντλῳ δʼ ἐνδούπησε πεσοῦσʼ ὡς εἰναλίη κήξ.
rousing him with a touch of his heel, and spoke to him, saying: “Awake, Peisistratus, son of Nestor; bring up thy fiery-hoofed horses, and yoke them beneath the car, that we may speed on our way.” Then Peisistratus, son of Nestor, answered, and said: “Telemachus, in no wise may we	καὶ τὴν μὲν φώκῃσι καὶ ἰχθύσι κύρμα γενέσθαι ἔκβαλον· αὐτὰρ ἐγὼ λιπόμην ἀκαχήμενος ἦτορ· τοὺς δʼ Ἰθάκῃ ἐπέλασσε φέρων ἄνεμός τε καὶ ὕδωρ, ἔνθα με Λαέρτης πρίατο κτεάτεσσιν ἑοῖσιν. οὕτω τήνδε τε γαῖαν ἐγὼν ἴδον ὀφθαλμοῖσι.
 drive through the dark night, how eager soever for our journey; and soon it will be dawn. Wait then, until the warrior son of Atreus, Menelaus, famed for his spear, shall bring gifts and set them on the car, and shall send us on our way with kindly words of farewell. For a guest remembers all his days	τὸν δʼ αὖ διογενὴς Ὀδυσεὺς ἠμείβετο μύθῳ· Εὔμαιʼ, ἦ μάλα δή μοι ἐνὶ φρεσὶ θυμὸν ὄρινας ταῦτα ἕκαστα λέγων, ὅσα δὴ πάθες ἄλγεα θυμῷ. ἀλλʼ ἦ τοι σοὶ μὲν παρὰ καὶ κακῷ ἐσθλὸν ἔθηκε Ζεύς, ἐπεὶ ἀνδρὸς δώματʼ ἀφίκεο πολλὰ μογήσας
the host who shews him kindness.” So he spoke, and presently came golden-throned Dawn. Up to them then came Menelaus, good at the war-cry, rising from his couch from beside fair-tressed Helen. And when the prince, the dear son of Odysseus, saw him,	ἠπίου, ὃς δή τοι παρέχει βρῶσίν τε πόσιν τε ἐνδυκέως, ζώεις δʼ ἀγαθὸν βίον· αὐτὰρ ἐγώ γε πολλὰ βροτῶν ἐπὶ ἄστεʼ ἀλώμενος ἐνθάδʼ ἱκάνω. ὣς οἱ μὲν τοιαῦτα πρὸς ἀλλήλους ἀγόρευον, καδδραθέτην δʼ οὐ πολλὸν ἐπὶ χρόνον, ἀλλὰ μίνυνθα·
he made haste to put about him his bright tunic, and to fling over his mighty shoulders a great cloak, and went forth. Then Telemachus, the dear son of divine Odysseus, came up to Menelaus, and addressed him, saying: “Menelaus, son of Atreus, fostered of Zeus, leader of hosts,	αἶψα γὰρ Ἠὼς ἦλθεν ἐΰθρονος. οἱ δʼ ἐπὶ χέρσου Τηλεμάχου ἕταροι λύον ἱστία, κὰδ δʼ ἕλον ἱστὸν καρπαλίμως, τὴν δʼ εἰς ὅρμον προέρυσσαν ἐρετμοῖς· ἐκ δʼ εὐνὰς ἔβαλον, κατὰ δὲ πρυμνήσιʼ ἔδησαν· ἐκ δὲ καὶ αὐτοὶ βαῖνον ἐπὶ ῥηγμῖνι θαλάσσης,
send me back now at length to my dear native land, for now my heart is eager to return home.” Then Menelaus, good at the war-cry, answered him: “Telemachus, I verily shall not hold thee here a long time, when thou art eager to return. Nay, I should blame another,	δεῖπνόν τʼ ἐντύνοντο κερῶντό τε αἴθοπα οἶνον. αὐτὰρ ἐπεὶ πόσιος καὶ ἐδητύος ἐξ ἔρον ἕντο, τοῖσι δὲ Τηλέμαχος πεπνυμένος ἤρχετο μύθων· ὑμεῖς μὲν νῦν ἄστυδʼ ἐλαύνετε νῆα μέλαιναν, αὐτὰρ ἐγὼν ἀγροὺς ἐπιείσομαι ἠδὲ βοτῆρας·
who, as host, loves overmuch or hates overmuch; better is due measure in all things. 'Tis equal wrong if a man speed on a guest who is loath to go, and if he keep back one that is eager to be gone. One should make welcome the present guest, and send forth him that would go.	ἑσπέριος δʼ εἰς ἄστυ ἰδὼν ἐμὰ ἔργα κάτειμι. ἠῶθεν δέ κεν ὔμμιν ὁδοιπόριον παραθείμην, δαῖτʼ ἀγαθὴν κρειῶν τε καὶ οἴνου ἡδυπότοιο. τὸν δʼ αὖτε προσέειπε Θεοκλύμενος θεοειδής· πῆ γὰρ ἐγώ, φίλε τέκνον, ἴω; τεῦ δώμαθʼ ἵκωμαι
 But stay, till I bring fair gifts and put them on thy car, and thine own eyes behold them, and till I bid the women make ready a meal in the halls of the abundant store that is within. It is a double boon—honor and glory it brings, and profit withal—that the traveller should dine before he goes forth over the wide and boundless earth.	ἀνδρῶν οἳ κραναὴν Ἰθάκην κάτα κοιρανέουσιν; ἦ ἰθὺς σῆς μητρὸς ἴω καὶ σοῖο δόμοιο; τὸν δʼ αὖ Τηλέμαχος πεπνυμένος ἀντίον ηὔδα· ἄλλως μέν σʼ ἂν ἐγώ γε καὶ ἡμέτερόνδε κελοίμην ἔρχεσθʼ· οὐ γάρ τι ξενίων ποθή· ἀλλὰ σοὶ αὐτῷ
And if thou art fain to journey through Hellas and mid- Argos , be it so, to the end that I may myself go with thee, and I will yoke for thee horses, and lead thee to the cities of men. Nor will any one send us away empty-handed, but will give us some one thing at least to bear with us, a fair brazen tripod or cauldron,	χεῖρον, ἐπεί τοι ἐγὼ μὲν ἀπέσσομαι, οὐδέ σε μήτηρ ὄψεται· οὐ μὲν γάρ τι θαμὰ μνηστῆρσʼ ἐνὶ οἴκῳ φαίνεται, ἀλλʼ ἀπὸ τῶν ὑπερωΐῳ ἱστὸν ὑφαίνει. ἀλλά τοι ἄλλον φῶτα πιφαύσκομαι ὅν κεν ἵκοιο, Εὐρύμαχον, Πολύβοιο δαΐφρονος ἀγλαὸν υἱόν,
or a pair of mules, or a golden cup.” Then wise Telemachus answered him: “Menelaus, son of Atreus, fostered of Zeus, leader of hosts, rather would I go at once to my home, for when I departed I left behind me no one to watch over my possessions.	τὸν νῦν ἶσα θεῷ Ἰθακήσιοι εἰσορόωσι· καὶ γὰρ πολλὸν ἄριστος ἀνὴρ μέμονέν τε μάλιστα μητέρʼ ἐμὴν γαμέειν καὶ Ὀδυσσῆος γέρας ἕξειν. ἀλλὰ τά γε Ζεὺς οἶδεν Ὀλύμπιος, αἰθέρι ναίων, εἴ κέ σφι πρὸ γάμοιο τελευτήσει κακὸν ἦμαρ.
Up to him then came Eteoneus, son of Boethous, just risen from his bed, for he dwelt not far from him. Him Menelaus, good at the war-cry, bade kindle a fire and roast of the flesh; and he heard, and obeyed. And Menelaus himself went down to his vaulted treasure-chamber,	ὣς ἄρα οἱ εἰπόντι ἐπέπτατο δεξιὸς ὄρνις, κίρκος, Ἀπόλλωνος ταχὺς ἄγγελος· ἐν δὲ πόδεσσι τίλλε πέλειαν ἔχων, κατὰ δὲ πτερὰ χεῦεν ἔραζε μεσσηγὺς νηός τε καὶ αὐτοῦ Τηλεμάχοιο. τὸν δὲ Θεοκλύμενος ἑτάρων ἀπονόσφι καλέσσας
 not alone, for with him went Helen and Megapenthes. But when they came to the place where his treasures were stored, the son of Atreus took a two-handled cup, and bade his son Megapenthes bear a mixing bowl of silver. And Helen came up to the chests	ἔν τʼ ἄρα οἱ φῦ χειρὶ ἔπος τʼ ἔφατʼ ἔκ τʼ ὀνόμαζε· Τηλέμαχʼ, οὔ τοι ἄνευ θεοῦ ἔπτατο δεξιὸς ὄρνις ἔγνων γάρ μιν ἐσάντα ἰδὼν οἰωνὸν ἐόντα. ὑμετέρου δʼ οὐκ ἔστι γένος βασιλεύτερον ἄλλο ἐν δήμῳ Ἰθάκης, ἀλλʼ ὑμεῖς καρτεροὶ αἰεί.
 in which were her richly-broidered robes, that she herself had wrought. One of these Helen, the beautiful lady, lifted out and bore away, the one that was fairest in its broideries, and the amplest. It shone like a star, and lay beneath all the rest. Then they went forth through the house until they came to	τὸν δʼ αὖ Τηλέμαχος πεπνυμένος ἀντίον ηὔδα· αἲ γὰρ τοῦτο, ξεῖνε, ἔπος τετελεσμένον εἴη· τῷ κε τάχα γνοίης φιλότητά τε πολλά τε δῶρα ἐξ ἐμεῦ, ὡς ἄν τίς σε συναντόμενος μακαρίζοι. ἦ καὶ Πείραιον προσεφώνεε, πιστὸν ἑταῖρον·
Telemachus; and fair-haired Menelaus spoke to him, and said: “Telemachus, may Zeus, the loud-thundering lord of Here, verily bring to pass for thee thy return, even as thy heart desires. And of all the gifts that lie stored as treasures in my house, I will give thee that one which is fairest and costliest.	Πείραιε Κλυτίδη, σὺ δέ μοι τά περ ἄλλα μάλιστα πείθῃ ἐμῶν ἑτάρων, οἵ μοι Πύλον εἰς ἅμʼ ἕποντο· καὶ νῦν μοι τὸν ξεῖνον ἄγων ἐν δώμασι σοῖσιν ἐνδυκέως φιλέειν καὶ τιέμεν, εἰς ὅ κεν ἔλθω. τὸν δʼ αὖ Πείραιος δουρικλυτὸς ἀντίον ηὔδα·
I will give thee a well-wrought mixing-bowl. It is all of silver, and with gold are the rims thereof gilded, the work of Hephaestus; and the warrior Phaedimus, king of the Sidonians, gave it me, when his house sheltered me as I came thither; and now I am minded to give it to thee.”	Τηλέμαχʼ, εἰ γάρ κεν σὺ πολὺν χρόνον ἐνθάδε μίμνοι, τόνδε τʼ ἐγὼ κομιῶ, ξενίων δέ οἱ οὐ ποθὴ ἔσται. ὣς εἰπὼν ἐπὶ νηὸς ἔβη, ἐκέλευσε δʼ ἑταίρους αὐτούς τʼ ἀμβαίνειν ἀνά τε πρυμνήσια λῦσαι. οἱ δʼ αἶψʼ εἴσβαινον καὶ ἐπὶ κληῗσι καθῖζον.
So saying, the warrior, son of Atreus, placed the two-handled cup in his hands. And the strong Megapenthes brought the bright mixing-bowl of silver and set it before him, and fair-cheeked Helen came up with the robe in her hands, and spoke, and addressed him:	Τηλέμαχος δʼ ὑπὸ ποσσὶν ἐδήσατο καλὰ πέδιλα, εἵλετο δʼ ἄλκιμον ἔγχος, ἀκαχμένον ὀξέϊ χαλκῷ, νηὸς ἀπʼ ἰκριόφιν· τοὶ δὲ πρυμνήσιʼ ἔλυσαν. οἱ μὲν ἀνώσαντες πλέον ἐς πόλιν, ὡς ἐκέλευσε Τηλέμαχος, φίλος υἱὸς Ὀδυσσῆος θείοιο·
“Lo, I too give thee this gift, dear child, a remembrance of the hands of Helen, against the day of thy longed-for marriage, for thy bride to wear it. But until then let it lie in thy halls in the keeping of thy dear mother. And for thyself I wish that with joy thou mayest reach thy well-built house and thy native land.”	τὸν δʼ ὦκα προβιβάντα πόδες φέρον, ὄφρʼ ἵκετʼ αὐλήν, ἔνθα οἱ ἦσαν ὕες μάλα μυρίαι, ᾗσι συβώτης ἐσθλὸς ἐὼν ἐνίαυεν, ἀνάκτεσιν ἤπια εἰδώς,
 So saying, she placed it in his hands, and he took it gladly. And the prince Peisistratus took the gifts, and laid them in the box of the chariot, and gazed at them all wondering in his heart. Then fair-haired Menelaus led them to the house, and the two sat down on chairs and high seats.	τὼ δʼ αὖτʼ ἐν κλισίῃ Ὀδυσεὺς καὶ δῖος ὑφορβὸς ἐντύνοντο ἄριστον ἅμʼ ἠοῖ, κηαμένω πῦρ, ἔκπεμψάν τε νομῆας ἅμʼ ἀγρομένοισι σύεσσι· Τηλέμαχον δὲ περίσσαινον κύνες ὑλακόμωροι, οὐδʼ ὕλαον προσιόντα. νόησε δὲ δῖος Ὀδυσσεὺς σαίνοντάς τε κύνας, περί τε κτύπος ἦλθε ποδοῖϊν. αἶψα δʼ ἄρʼ Εὔμαιον ἔπεα πτερόεντα προσηύδα· Εὔμαιʼ, ἦ μάλα τίς τοι ἐλεύσεται ἐνθάδʼ ἑταῖρος ἢ καὶ γνώριμος ἄλλος, ἐπεὶ κύνες οὐχ ὑλάουσιν, ἀλλὰ περισσαίνουσι· ποδῶν δʼ ὑπὸ δοῦπον ἀκούω. οὔ πω πᾶν εἴρητο ἔπος, ὅτε οἱ φίλος υἱὸς ἔστη ἐνὶ προθύροισι. ταφὼν δʼ ἀνόρουσε συβώτης, ἐκ δʼ ἄρα οἱ χειρῶν πέσον ἄγγεα, τοῖς ἐπονεῖτο, κιρνὰς αἴθοπα οἶνον. ὁ δʼ ἀντίος ἦλθεν ἄνακτος, κύσσε δέ μιν κεφαλήν τε καὶ ἄμφω φάεα καλὰ χεῖράς τʼ ἀμφοτέρας· θαλερὸν δέ οἱ ἔκπεσε δάκρυ. ὡς δὲ πατὴρ ὃν παῖδα φίλα φρονέων ἀγαπάζῃ ἐλθόντʼ ἐξ ἀπίης γαίης δεκάτῳ ἐνιαυτῷ, μοῦνον τηλύγετον, τῷ ἔπʼ ἄλγεα πολλὰ μογήσῃ, ὣς τότε Τηλέμαχον θεοειδέα δῖος ὑφορβὸς πάντα κύσεν περιφύς, ὡς ἐκ θανάτοιο φυγόντα· καί ῥʼ ὀλοφυρόμενος ἔπεα πτερόεντα προσηύδα· ἦλθες, Τηλέμαχε, γλυκερὸν φάος. οὔ σʼ ἔτʼ ἐγώ γε ὄψεσθαι ἐφάμην, ἐπεὶ ᾤχεο νηῒ Πύλονδε. ἀλλʼ ἄγε νῦν εἴσελθε, φίλον τέκος, ὄφρα σε θυμῷ τέρψομαι εἰσορόων νέον ἄλλοθεν ἔνδον ἐόντα. οὐ μὲν γάρ τι θάμʼ ἀγρὸν ἐπέρχεαι οὐδὲ νομῆας, ἀλλʼ ἐπιδημεύεις· ὣς γάρ νύ τοι εὔαδε θυμῷ, ἀνδρῶν μνηστήρων ἐσορᾶν ἀΐδηλον ὅμιλον. τὸν δʼ αὖ Τηλέμαχος πεπνυμένος ἀντίον ηὔδα· ἔσσεται οὕτως, ἄττα· σέθεν δʼ ἕνεκʼ ἐνθάδʼ ἱκάνω, ὄφρα σέ τʼ ὀφθαλμοῖσιν ἴδω καὶ μῦθον ἀκούσω, ἤ μοι ἔτʼ ἐν μεγάροις μήτηρ μένει, ἦέ τις ἤδη ἀνδρῶν ἄλλος ἔγημεν, Ὀδυσσῆος δέ που εὐνὴ χήτει ἐνευναίων κάκʼ ἀράχνια κεῖται ἔχουσα. τὸν δʼ αὖτε προσέειπε συβώτης, ὄρχαμος ἀνδρῶν· καὶ λίην κείνη γε μένει τετληότι θυμῷ σοῖσιν ἐνὶ μεγάροισιν· ὀϊζυραὶ δέ οἱ αἰεὶ φθίνουσιν νύκτες τε καὶ ἤματα δάκρυ χεούσῃ. ὣς ἄρα φωνήσας οἱ ἐδέξατο χάλκεον ἔγχος· αὐτὰρ ὅ γʼ εἴσω ἴεν καὶ ὑπέρβη λάϊνον οὐδόν. τῷ δʼ ἕδρης ἐπιόντι πατὴρ ὑπόειξεν Ὀδυσσεύς· Τηλέμαχος δʼ ἑτέρωθεν ἐρήτυε φώνησέν τε· ἧσʼ, ὦ ξεῖνʼ· ἡμεῖς δὲ καὶ ἄλλοθι δήομεν ἕδρην σταθμῷ ἐν ἡμετέρῳ· πάρα δʼ ἀνὴρ ὃς καταθήσει. ὣς φάθʼ, ὁ δʼ αὖτις ἰὼν κατʼ ἄρʼ ἕζετο· τῷ δὲ συβώτης. χεῦεν ὕπο χλωρὰς ῥῶπας καὶ κῶας ὕπερθεν· ἔνθα καθέζετʼ ἔπειτα Ὀδυσσῆος φίλος υἱός. τοῖσιν δʼ αὖ κρειῶν πίνακας παρέθηκε συβώτης ὀπταλέων, ἅ ῥα τῇ προτέρῃ ὑπέλειπον ἔδοντες, σῖτον δʼ ἐσσυμένως παρενήνεεν ἐν κανέοισιν, ἐν δʼ ἄρα κισσυβίῳ κίρνη μελιηδέα οἶνον· αὐτὸς δʼ ἀντίον ἷζεν Ὀδυσσῆος θείοιο. οἱ δʼ ἐπʼ ὀνείαθʼ ἑτοῖμα προκείμενα χεῖρας ἴαλλον. αὐτὰρ ἐπεὶ πόσιος καὶ ἐδητύος ἐξ ἔρον ἕντο, δὴ τότε Τηλέμαχος προσεφώνεε δῖον ὑφορβόν· ἄττα, πόθεν τοι ξεῖνος ὅδʼ ἵκετο; πῶς δέ ἑ ναῦται ἤγαγον εἰς Ἰθάκην; τίνες ἔμμεναι εὐχετόωντο; οὐ μὲν γάρ τί ἑ πεζὸν ὀΐομαι ἐνθάδʼ ἱκέσθαι. τὸν δʼ ἀπαμειβόμενος προσέφης, Εὔμαιε συβῶτα· τοιγὰρ ἐγώ τοι, τέκνον, ἀληθέα πάντʼ ἀγορεύσω. ἐκ μὲν Κρητάων γένος εὔχεται εὐρειάων, φησὶ δὲ πολλὰ βροτῶν ἐπὶ ἄστεα δινηθῆναι πλαζόμενος· ὣς γάρ οἱ ἐπέκλωσεν τά γε δαίμων. νῦν αὖ Θεσπρωτῶν ἀνδρῶν ἐκ νηὸς ἀποδρὰς ἤλυθʼ ἐμὸν πρὸς σταθμόν, ἐγὼ δέ τοι ἐγγυαλίξω· ἔρξον ὅπως ἐθέλεις· ἱκέτης δέ τοι εὔχεται εἶναι. τὸν δʼ αὖ Τηλέμαχος πεπνυμένος ἀντίον ηὔδα· Εὔμαιʼ, ἦ μάλα τοῦτο ἔπος θυμαλγὲς ἔειπες· πῶς γὰρ δὴ τὸν ξεῖνον ἐγὼν ὑποδέξομαι οἴκῳ; αὐτὸς μὲν νέος εἰμὶ καὶ οὔ πω χερσὶ πέποιθα ἄνδρʼ ἀπαμύνασθαι, ὅτε τις πρότερος χαλεπήνῃ· μητρὶ δʼ ἐμῇ δίχα θυμὸς ἐνὶ φρεσὶ μερμηρίζει, ἢ αὐτοῦ παρʼ ἐμοί τε μένῃ καὶ δῶμα κομίζῃ, εὐνήν τʼ αἰδομένη πόσιος δήμοιό τε φῆμιν, ἦ ἤδη ἅμʼ ἕπηται Ἀχαιῶν ὅς τις ἄριστος μνᾶται ἐνὶ μεγάροισιν ἀνὴρ καὶ πλεῖστα πόρῃσιν. ἀλλʼ ἦ τοὶ τὸν ξεῖνον, ἐπεὶ τεὸν ἵκετο δῶμα, ἕσσω μιν χλαῖνάν τε χιτῶνά τε, εἵματα καλά, δώσω δὲ ξίφος ἄμφηκες καὶ ποσσὶ πέδιλα, πέμψω δʼ ὅππη μιν κραδίη θυμός τε κελεύει. εἰ δʼ ἐθέλεις, σὺ κόμισσον ἐνὶ σταθμοῖσιν ἐρύξας· εἵματα δʼ ἐνθάδʼ ἐγὼ πέμψω καὶ σῖτον ἅπαντα ἔδμεναι, ὡς ἂν μή σε κατατρύχῃ καὶ ἑταίρους. κεῖσε δʼ ἂν οὔ μιν ἐγώ γε μετὰ μνηστῆρας ἐῷμι ἔρχεσθαι· λίην γὰρ ἀτάσθαλον ὕβριν ἔχουσι· μή μιν κερτομέωσιν, ἐμοὶ δʼ ἄχος ἔσσεται αἰνόν. πρῆξαι δʼ ἀργαλέον τι μετὰ πλεόνεσσιν ἐόντα ἄνδρα καὶ ἴφθιμον, ἐπεὶ ἦ πολὺ φέρτεροί εἰσι.
 And a handmaid brought water for the hands in a fair pitcher of gold, and poured it over a silver basin for them to wash, and beside them drew up a polished table.

And among them Peisistratus, son of Nestor, was first to speak: “Consider, Menelaus, fostered of Zeus, leader of hosts, whether it was for us two that the god showed this sign, or for thyself.” so he spoke, and Menelaus, dear to Ares, pondered	ἡ μὲν ἄρʼ ὣς ἀγόρευε μετὰ δμῳῇσι γυναιξίν, ἡμένη ἐν θαλάμῳ· ὁ δʼ ἐδείπνεε δῖος Ὀδυσσεύς· ἡ δʼ ἐπὶ οἷ καλέσασα προσηύδα δῖον ὑφορβόν· ἔρχεο, δῖʼ Εὔμαιε, κιὼν τὸν ξεῖνον ἄνωχθι ἐλθέμεν, ὄφρα τί μιν προσπτύξομαι ἠδʼ ἐρέωμαι εἴ που Ὀδυσσῆος ταλασίφρονος ἠὲ πέπυσται ἢ ἴδεν ὀφθαλμοῖσι· πολυπλάγκτῳ γὰρ ἔοικε. τὴν δʼ ἀπαμειβόμενος προσέφης, Εὔμαιε συβῶτα εἰ γάρ τοι, βασίλεια, σιωπήσειαν Ἀχαιοί· οἷʼ ὅ γε μυθεῖται, θέλγοιτό κέ τοι φίλον ἦτορ. τρεῖς γὰρ δή μιν νύκτας ἔχον, τρία δʼ ἤματʼ ἔρυξα ἐν κλισίῃ· πρῶτον γὰρ ἔμʼ ἵκετο νηὸς ἀποδράς· ἀλλʼ οὔ πω κακότητα διήνυσεν ἣν ἀγορεύων. ὡς δʼ ὅτʼ ἀοιδὸν ἀνὴρ ποτιδέρκεται, ὅς τε θεῶν ἒξ ἀείδει δεδαὼς ἔπεʼ ἱμερόεντα βροτοῖσι, τοῦ δʼ ἄμοτον μεμάασιν ἀκουέμεν, ὁππότʼ ἀείδῃ· ὣς ἐμὲ κεῖνος ἔθελγε παρήμενος ἐν μεγάροισι. φησὶ δʼ Ὀδυσσῆος ξεῖνος πατρώϊος εἶναι, Κρήτῃ ναιετάων, ὅθι Μίνωος γένος ἐστίν. ἔνθεν δὴ νῦν δεῦρο τόδʼ ἵκετο πήματα πάσχων, προπροκυλινδόμενος· στεῦται δʼ Ὀδυσῆος ἀκοῦσαι, ἀγχοῦ, Θεσπρωτῶν ἀνδρῶν ἐν πίονι δήμῳ, ζωοῦ· πολλὰ δʼ ἄγει κειμήλια ὅνδε δόμονδε. τὸν δʼ αὖτε προσέειπε περίφρων Πηνελόπεια· ἔρχεο, δεῦρο κάλεσσον, ἵνʼ ἀντίον αὐτὸς ἐνίσπῃ. οὗτοι δʼ ἠὲ θύρῃσι καθήμενοι ἑψιαάσθων. ἢ αὐτοῦ κατὰ δώματʼ, ἐπεί σφισι θυμὸς ἐΰφρων. αὐτῶν μὲν γὰρ κτήματʼ ἀκήρατα κεῖτʼ ἐνὶ οἴκῳ, σῖτος καὶ μέθυ ἡδύ· τὰ μὲν οἰκῆες ἔδουσιν, οἱ δʼ εἰς ἡμέτερον πωλεύμενοι ἤματα πάντα, βοῦς ἱερεύοντες καὶ ὄϊς καὶ πίονας αἶγας, εἰλαπινάζουσιν πίνουσί τε αἴθοπα οἶνον, μαψιδίως· τὰ δὲ πολλὰ κατάνεται. οὐ γὰρ ἔπʼ ἀνήρ, οἷος Ὀδυσσεὺς ἔσκεν, ἀρὴν ἀπὸ οἴκου ἀμῦναι. εἰ δʼ Ὀδυσεὺς ἔλθοι καὶ ἵκοιτʼ ἐς πατρίδα γαῖαν, αἶψά κε σὺν ᾧ παιδὶ βίας ἀποτίσεται ἀνδρῶν. ὣς φάτο, Τηλέμαχος δὲ μέγʼ ἔπταρεν, ἀμφὶ δὲ δῶμα σμερδαλέον κονάβησε· γέλασσε δὲ Πηνελόπεια, αἶψα δʼ ἄρʼ Εὔμαιον ἔπεα πτερόεντα προσηύδα· ἔρχεό μοι, τὸν ξεῖνον ἐναντίον ὧδε κάλεσσον. οὐχ ὁράᾳς ὅ μοι υἱὸς ἐπέπταρε πᾶσιν ἔπεσσι; τῷ κε καὶ οὐκ ἀτελὴς θάνατος μνηστῆρσι γένοιτο πᾶσι μάλʼ, οὐδέ κέ τις θάνατον καὶ κῆρας ἀλύξει. ἄλλο δέ τοι ἐρέω, σὺ δʼ ἐνὶ φρεσὶ βάλλεο σῇσιν· αἴ κʼ αὐτὸν γνώω νημερτέα πάντʼ ἐνέποντα, ἕσσω μιν χλαῖνάν τε χιτῶνά τε, εἵματα καλά. ὣς φάτο, βῆ δὲ συφορβός, ἐπεὶ τὸν μῦθον ἄκουσεν· ἀγχοῦ δʼ ἱστάμενος ἔπεα πτερόεντα προσηύδα· ξεῖνε πάτερ, καλέει σε περίφρων Πηνελόπεια, μήτηρ Τηλεμάχοιο· μεταλλῆσαί τί ἑ θυμὸς ἀμφὶ πόσει κέλεται, καὶ κήδεά περ πεπαθυίῃ. εἰ δέ κέ σε γνώῃ νημερτέα πάντʼ ἐνέποντα, ἕσσει σε χλαῖνάν τε χιτῶνά τε, τῶν σὺ μάλιστα χρηΐζεις· σῖτον δὲ καὶ αἰτίζων κατὰ δῆμον γαστέρα βοσκήσεις· δώσει δέ τοι ὅς κʼ ἐθέλῃσι.
from the mountain, where are his kin, and where he was born, and snatched up the goose that was bred in the house, even so shall Odysseus return to his home after many toils and many wanderings, and shall take vengeance; or even now he is at home, and is sowing the seeds of evil for all the wooers.” Then again wise Telemachus answered her:	τὸν δʼ αὖτε προσέειπε πολύτλας δῖος Ὀδυσσεύς· Εὔμαιʼ, αἶψά κʼ ἐγὼ νημερτέα πάντʼ ἐνέποιμι κούρῃ Ἰκαρίοιο, περίφρονι Πηνελοπείῃ· οἶδα γὰρ εὖ περὶ κείνου, ὁμὴν δʼ ἀνεδέγμεθʼ ὀϊζύν. ἀλλὰ μνηστήρων χαλεπῶν ὑποδείδιʼ ὅμιλον,
“So may Zeus grant, the loud-thundering lord of Here; then will I even there ever pray to thee, as to a god.” He spoke, and touched the two horses with the lash, and they sped swiftly toward the plain, coursing eagerly through the city. So all day long they shook the yoke they bore about their necks.	τῶν ὕβρις τε βίη τε σιδήρεον οὐρανὸν ἵκει. καὶ γὰρ νῦν, ὅτε μʼ οὗτος ἀνὴρ κατὰ δῶμα κιόντα οὔ τι κακὸν ῥέξαντα βαλὼν ὀδύνῃσιν ἔδωκεν, οὔτε τι Τηλέμαχος τό γʼ ἐπήρκεσεν οὔτε τις ἄλλος. τῷ νῦν Πηνελόπειαν ἐνὶ μεγάροισιν ἄνωχθι
And the sun set, and all the ways grew dark. And they came to Pherae, to the house of Diocles, son of Ortilochus, whom Alpheus begot. There they spent the night, and before them he set the entertainment due to strangers. As soon as early Dawn appeared, the rosy-fingered,	μεῖναι, ἐπειγομένην περ, ἐς ἠέλιον καταδύντα· καὶ τότε μʼ εἰρέσθω πόσιος πέρι νόστιμον ἦμαρ, ἀσσοτέρω καθίσασα παραὶ πυρί· εἵματα γάρ τοι λύγρʼ ἔχω· οἶσθα καὶ αὐτός, ἐπεί σε πρῶθʼ ἱκέτευσα. ὣς φάτο, βῆ δὲ συφορβός, ἐπεὶ τὸν μῦθον ἄκουσε.
they yoked the horses, and mounted the inlaid car, and drove forth from the gateway and the echoing portico. Then Peisistratus touched the horses with the whip to start them, and nothing loath the pair sped onward, and soon thereafter they reached the steep citadel of Pylos . Then Telemachus spoke to the son of Nestor, saying:	τὸν δʼ ὑπὲρ οὐδοῦ βάντα προσηύδα Πηνελόπεια· οὐ σύ γʼ ἄγεις, Εὔμαιε· τί τοῦτʼ ἐνόησεν ἀλήτης; ἦ τινά που δείσας ἐξαίσιον ἦε καὶ ἄλλως αἰδεῖται κατὰ δῶμα; κακὸς δʼ αἰδοῖος ἀλήτης. τὴν δʼ ἀπαμειβόμενος προσέφης, Εὔμαιε συβῶτα·
 “Son of Nestor, wilt thou now make me a promise, and fulfil it, as I bid? Friends from of old we call ourselves by reason of our fathers' friendship, and we are moreover of the same age, and this journey shall yet more stablish us in oneness of heart. Lead me not past my ship, O thou fostered of Zeus, but leave me there,	μυθεῖται κατὰ μοῖραν, ἅ πέρ κʼ οἴοιτο καὶ ἄλλος, ὕβριν ἀλυσκάζων ἀνδρῶν ὑπερηνορεόντων. ἀλλά σε μεῖναι ἄνωγεν ἐς ἠέλιον καταδύντα. καὶ δὲ σοὶ ὧδʼ αὐτῇ πολὺ κάλλιον, ὦ βασίλεια, οἴην πρὸς ξεῖνον φάσθαι ἔπος ἠδʼ ἐπακοῦσαι.
lest that old man keep me in his house against my will, fain to show me kindness, whereas I must needs hasten home.” So he spoke, and the son of Nestor took counsel with his heart, how he might duly give the promise and fulfil it. And, as he pondered, this seemed to him the better course.	τὸν δʼ αὖτε προσέειπε περίφρων Πηνελόπεια· οὐκ ἄφρων ὁ ξεῖνος· ὀΐεται, ὥς περ ἂν εἴη· οὐ γάρ πού τινες ὧδε καταθνητῶν ἀνθρώπων ἀνέρες ὑβρίζοντες ἀτάσθαλα μηχανόωνται. ἡ μὲν ἄρʼ ὣς ἀγόρευεν, ὁ δʼ ᾤχετο δῖος ὑφορβὸς
He turned his horses to the swift ship and the shore of the sea, and took out, and set in the stern of the ship the beautiful gifts, the raiment and gold, which Menelaus gave him. And he urged on Telemachus, and addressed him with winged words: “Make haste now to go on board, and bid all thy comrades to do likewise,	μνηστήρων ἐς ὅμιλον, ἐπεὶ διεπέφραδε πάντα. αἶψα δὲ Τηλέμαχον ἔπεα πτερόεντα προσηύδα, ἄγχι σχὼν κεφαλήν, ἵνα μὴ πευθοίαθʼ οἱ ἄλλοι· ὦ φίλʼ, ἐγὼ μὲν ἄπειμι, σύας καὶ κεῖνα φυλάξων, σὸν καὶ ἐμὸν βίοτον· σοὶ δʼ ἐνθάδε πάντα μελόντων.
before I reach home and bring the old man word. For well I know this in mind and heart, so masterful is his spirit he will not let thee go, but will himself come hither to bid thee to his house; and, I tell thee, he will not go back without thee; for very wroth will he be, despite of all.”	αὐτὸν μέν σε πρῶτα σάω, καὶ φράζεο θυμῷ μή τι πάθῃς· πολλοὶ δὲ κακὰ φρονέουσιν Ἀχαιῶν, τοὺς Ζεὺς ἐξολέσειε πρὶν ἡμῖν πῆμα γενέσθαι. τὸν δʼ αὖ Τηλέμαχος πεπνυμένος ἀντίον ηὔδα· ἔσσεται οὕτως, ἄττα· σὺ δʼ ἔρχεο δειελιήσας·
So saying, he drove his horses with beautiful mane back to the city of the Pylians, and speedily reached the palace. And Telemachus called to his men, and gave command to them, saying: “Set all the gear in order, men, in the black ship, and let us go on board ourselves, that we may speed on our way.”	ἠῶθεν δʼ ἰέναι καὶ ἄγειν ἱερήϊα καλά· αὐτὰρ ἐμοὶ τάδε πάντα καὶ ἀθανάτοισι μελήσει. ὣς φάθʼ, ὁ δʼ αὖτις ἄρʼ ἕζετʼ ἐϋξέστου ἐπὶ δίφρου, πλησάμενος δʼ ἄρα θυμὸν ἐδητύος ἠδὲ ποτῆτος βῆ ῥʼ ἴμεναι μεθʼ ὕας, λίπε δʼ ἕρκεά τε μέγαρόν τε,
So he spoke, and they readily hearkened and obeyed; and at once they went on board, and sat down upon the benches. He verily was busied thus, and was praying and offering sacrifice to Athena by the stern of the ship, when there drew nigh to him a man from a far land, one that was fleeing out of Argos because he had slain a man;	πλεῖον δαιτυμόνων· οἱ δʼ ὀρχηστυῖ καὶ ἀοιδῇ τέρποντʼ· ἤδη γὰρ καὶ ἐπήλυθε δείελον ἦμαρ.
who for a full year had kept much wealth from him by force. Now Melampus meanwhile lay bound with bitter bonds in the halls of Phylacus, suffering grievous pains because of the daughter of Neleus, and the terrible blindness of heart which the goddess, the Erinys, who brings houses to ruin, had laid upon him.	ἦλθε δʼ ἐπὶ πτωχὸς πανδήμιος, ὃς κατὰ ἄστυ πτωχεύεσκʼ Ἰθάκης, μετὰ δʼ ἔπρεπε γαστέρι μάργῃ ἀζηχὲς φαγέμεν καὶ πιέμεν· οὐδέ οἱ ἦν ἲς οὐδὲ βίη, εἶδος δὲ μάλα μέγας ἦν ὁράασθαι.
Howbeit he escaped his fate, and drove off the deep-lowing kine from Phylace to Pylos , and avenged the cruel deed upon godlike Neleus, and brought the maiden home to be his own brother's wife. For himself, he went to the land of other men, to horse-pasturing Argos , for there it was appointed him	Ἀρναῖος δʼ ὄνομʼ ἔσκε· τὸ γὰρ θέτο πότνια μήτηρ ἐκ γενετῆς· Ἶρον δὲ νέοι κίκλησκον ἅπαντες, οὕνεκʼ ἀπαγγέλλεσκε κιών, ὅτε πού τις ἀνώγοι· ὅς ῥʼ ἐλθὼν Ὀδυσῆα διώκετο οἷο δόμοιο, καί μιν νεικείων ἔπεα πτερόεντα προσηύδα·
 to dwell, bearing sway over many Argives. There he wedded a wife and built him a high-roofed house, and begot Antiphates and Mantius, two stalwart sons. Now Antiphates begot great-hearted Oicles, and Oicles Amphiaraus, the rouser of the host,	εἶκε, γέρον, προθύρου, μὴ δὴ τάχα καὶ ποδὸς ἕλκῃ. οὐκ ἀΐεις ὅτι δή μοι ἐπιλλίζουσιν ἅπαντες, ἑλκέμεναι δὲ κέλονται; ἐγὼ δʼ αἰσχύνομαι ἔμπης. ἀλλʼ ἄνα, μὴ τάχα νῶϊν ἔρις καὶ χερσὶ γένηται. τὸν δʼ ἄρʼ ὑπόδρα ἰδὼν προσέφη πολύμητις Ὀδυσσεύς·
 whom Zeus, who bears the aegis, and Apollo heartily loved with all manner of love. Yet he did not reach the threshold of old age, but died in Thebe, because of a woman's gifts. To him were born sons, Alcmaeon and Amphilochus. And Mantius on his part begot Polypheides and Cleitus.	δαιμόνιʼ, οὔτε τί σε ῥέζω κακὸν οὔτʼ ἀγορεύω, οὔτε τινὰ φθονέω δόμεναι καὶ πόλλʼ ἀνελόντα. οὐδὸς δʼ ἀμφοτέρους ὅδε χείσεται, οὐδέ τί σε χρὴ ἀλλοτρίων φθονέειν· δοκέεις δέ μοι εἶναι ἀλήτης ὥς περ ἐγών, ὄλβον δὲ θεοὶ μέλλουσιν ὀπάζειν.
Now Cleitus golden-throned Dawn snatched away by reason of his beauty, that he might dwell with the immortals; but of Polypheides, high of heart, Apollo made a seer, far the best of mortals, after that Amphiaraus was dead. He removed to Hyperesia , having waxed wroth with his father,	χερσὶ δὲ μή τι λίην προκαλίζεο, μή με χολώσῃς, μή σε γέρων περ ἐὼν στῆθος καὶ χείλεα φύρσω αἵματος· ἡσυχίη δʼ ἂν ἐμοὶ καὶ μᾶλλον ἔτʼ εἴη αὔριον· οὐ μὲν γάρ τί σʼ ὑποστρέψεσθαι ὀΐω δεύτερον ἐς μέγαρον Λαερτιάδεω Ὀδυσῆος.
and there he dwelt and prophesied to all men. His son it was, Theoclymenus by name, who now came and stood by Telemachus; and he found him pouring libations and praying by his swift, black ship, and he spoke, and addressed him with winged words:	τὸν δὲ χολωσάμενος προσεφώνεεν Ἶρος ἀλήτης· ὢ πόποι, ὡς ὁ μολοβρὸς ἐπιτροχάδην ἀγορεύει, γρηῒ καμινοῖ ἶσος· ὃν ἂν κακὰ μητισαίμην κόπτων ἀμφοτέρῃσι, χαμαὶ δέ κε πάντας ὀδόντας γναθμῶν ἐξελάσαιμι συὸς ὣς ληϊβοτείρης.
“Friend, since I find thee making burnt-offering in this place, I beseech thee by thine offerings and by the god, aye, and by thine own life and the lives of thy comrades who follow thee, tell me truly what I ask, and hide it not. Who art thou among men, and from whence? Where is thy city, and where thy parents?”	ζῶσαι νῦν, ἵνα πάντες ἐπιγνώωσι καὶ οἵδε μαρναμένους· πῶς δʼ ἂν σὺ νεωτέρῳ ἀνδρὶ μάχοιο; ὣς οἱ μὲν προπάροιθε θυράων ὑψηλάων οὐδοῦ ἔπι ξεστοῦ πανθυμαδὸν ὀκριόωντο. τοῖϊν δὲ ξυνέηχʼ ἱερὸν μένος Ἀντινόοιο,
And wise Telemachus answered him: “Then verily, stranger, will I frankly tell thee all. Of Ithaca I am by birth, and my father is Odysseus, as sure as ever such a one there was; but now he has perished by a pitiful fate. Therefore have I now taken my comrades and a black ship,	ἡδὺ δʼ ἄρʼ ἐκγελάσας μετεφώνει μνηστήρεσσιν· ὦ φίλοι, οὐ μέν πώ τι πάρος τοιοῦτον ἐτύχθη, οἵην τερπωλὴν θεὸς ἤγαγεν ἐς τόδε δῶμα. ὁ ξεῖνός τε καὶ Ἶρος ἐρίζετον ἀλλήλοιϊν χερσὶ μαχέσσασθαι· ἀλλὰ ξυνελάσσομεν ὦκα.
and am come to seek tidings of my father, that has long been gone.” Then godlike Theoclymenus answered him: “Even so have I, too, fled from my country, for that I slew a man, one of mine own kin. And many brethren and kinsmen of his there are in horse-pasturing Argos , and mightily do they bear sway over the Achaeans.	ὣς ἔφαθʼ, οἱ δʼ ἄρα πάντες ἀνήϊξαν γελόωντες, ἀμφὶ δʼ ἄρα πτωχοὺς κακοείμονας ἠγερέθοντο. τοῖσιν δʼ Ἀντίνοος μετέφη, Εὐπείθεος υἱός· κέκλυτέ μευ, μνηστῆρες ἀγήνορες, ὄφρα τι εἴπω. γαστέρες αἵδʼ αἰγῶν κέατʼ ἐν πυρί, τὰς ἐπὶ δόρπῳ
It is to shun death and black fate at their hands that I flee, for, I ween, it is my lot to be a wanderer among men. But do thou set me on thy ship, since in my flight I have made prayer to thee, lest they utterly slay me; for methinks they are in pursuit.” And wise Telemachus answered him:	κατθέμεθα κνίσης τε καὶ αἵματος ἐμπλήσαντες· ὁππότερος δέ κε νικήσῃ κρείσσων τε γένηται, τάων ἥν κʼ ἐθέλῃσιν ἀναστὰς αὐτὸς ἑλέσθω· αἰεὶ αὖθʼ ἡμῖν μεταδαίσεται, οὐδέ τινʼ ἄλλον πτωχὸν ἔσω μίσγεσθαι ἐάσομεν αἰτήσοντα.
 Then he sat down in the stern and made Theoclymenus sit down beside him; and his men loosed the stern cables. And Telemachus called to his men and bade them lay hold of the tackling, and they quickly obeyed. The mast of fir	ὣς ἔφατʼ Ἀντίνοος, τοῖσιν δʼ ἐπιήνδανε μῦθος. τοῖς δὲ δολοφρονέων μετέφη πολύμητις Ὀδυσσεύς· ὦ φίλοι, οὔ πως ἔστι νεωτέρῳ ἀνδρὶ μάχεσθαι ἄνδρα γέροντα, δύῃ ἀρημένον· ἀλλά με γαστὴρ ὀτρύνει κακοεργός, ἵνα πληγῇσι δαμείω.
 they raised and set in the hollow socket, and made it fast with fore-stays, and hauled up the white sail with twisted thongs of oxhide. And flashing-eyed Athena sent them a favorable wind, blowing strongly through the sky, that, speeding swiftly, the ship might accomplish her way over the salt water of the sea.	ἀλλʼ ἄγε νῦν μοι πάντες ὀμόσσατε καρτερὸν ὅρκον, μή τις ἐπʼ Ἴρῳ ἦρα φέρων ἐμὲ χειρὶ βαρείῃ πλήξῃ ἀτασθάλλων, τούτῳ δέ με ἶφι δαμάσσῃ. ὣς ἔφαθʼ, οἱ δʼ ἄρα πάντες ἀπώμνυον ὡς ἐκέλευεν. αὐτὰρ ἐπεί ῥʼ ὄμοσάν τε τελεύτησάν τε τὸν ὅρκον,
So they fared past Crouni and Chalcis , with its beautiful streams. Now the sun set and all the ways grew dark. And the ship drew near to Pheae, sped by the wind of Zeus, and on past goodly Elis , where the Epeans hold sway. From thence again he steered for the sharp isles	τοῖς δʼ αὖτις μετέειφʼ ἱερὴ ἲς Τηλεμάχοιο· ξεῖνʼ, εἴ σʼ ὀτρύνει κραδίη καὶ θυμὸς ἀγήνωρ τοῦτον ἀλέξασθαι, τῶν δʼ ἄλλων μή τινʼ Ἀχαιῶν δείδιθʼ, ἐπεὶ πλεόνεσσι μαχήσεται ὅς κέ σε θείνῃ· ξεινοδόκος μὲν ἐγών, ἐπὶ δʼ αἰνεῖτον βασιλῆες,
pondering whether he should escape death or be taken. But the two, Odysseus and the goodly swineherd, were supping in the hut, and with them supped the other men. But when they had put from them the desire of food and drink, Odysseus spoke among them, making trial of the swineherd to see	Ἀντίνοός τε καὶ Εὐρύμαχος, πεπνυμένω ἄμφω. ὣς ἔφαθʼ, οἱ δʼ ἄρα πάντες ἐπῄνεον· αὐτὰρ Ὀδυσσεὺς ζώσατο μὲν ῥάκεσιν περὶ μήδεα, φαῖνε δὲ μηροὺς καλούς τε μεγάλους τε, φάνεν δέ οἱ εὐρέες ὦμοι στήθεά τε στιβαροί τε βραχίονες· αὐτὰρ Ἀθήνη
whether he would still entertain him with kindly care and bid him remain there at the farmstead, or send him forth to the city: “Hearken now, Eumaeus, and all ye other men. In the morning I am minded to go forth to the city to beg, that I may not be the ruin of thee and of thy men. Now then, give me good counsel, and send with me a trusty guide to lead me thither;	ἄγχι παρισταμένη μέλεʼ ἤλδανε ποιμένι λαῶν. μνηστῆρες δʼ ἄρα πάντες ὑπερφιάλως ἀγάσαντο· ὧδε δέ τις εἴπεσκεν ἰδὼν ἐς πλησίον ἄλλον· ἦ τάχα Ἶρος Ἄϊρος ἐπίσπαστον κακὸν ἕξει, οἵην ἐκ ῥακέων ὁ γέρων ἐπιγουνίδα φαίνει.
 but through the city will I wander by myself perforce, in the hope that one haply will give me a cup of water and a loaf. Aye, and I would go to the house of godlike Odysseus and bear tidings to the wise Penelope,	ὣς ἄρʼ ἔφαν, Ἴρῳ δὲ κακῶς ὠρίνετο θυμός. ἀλλὰ καὶ ὣς δρηστῆρες ἄγον ζώσαντες ἀνάγκῃ δειδιότα· σάρκες δὲ περιτρομέοντο μέλεσσιν. Ἀντίνοος δʼ ἐνένιπεν ἔπος τʼ ἔφατʼ ἔκ τʼ ὀνόμαζεν· νῦν μὲν μήτʼ εἴης, βουγάϊε, μήτε γένοιο,
 and join the company of the insolent wooers, if perchance they may give me a meal, since they have good cheer in abundance. Straightway might I do good service among them in all that they would. For I will tell thee, and do thou give heed and hearken. By the favour of Hermes, the messenger, who	εἰ δὴ τοῦτόν γε τρομέεις καὶ δείδιας αἰνῶς, ἄνδρα γέροντα, δύῃ ἀρημένον, ἥ μιν ἱκάνει. ἀλλʼ ἔκ τοι ἐρέω, τὸ δὲ καὶ τετελεσμένον ἔσται· αἴ κέν σʼ οὗτος νικήσῃ κρείσσων τε γένηται, πέμψω σʼ ἤπειρόνδε, βαλὼν ἐν νηὶ μελαίνῃ,
lends grace and glory to all men's work, in the business of serving no man beside can vie with me, in piling well a fire, in splitting dry faggots, in carving and roasting meat, and in pouring wine —in all things in which meaner men serve the noble.”	εἰς Ἔχετον βασιλῆα, βροτῶν δηλήμονα πάντων, ὅς κʼ ἀπὸ ῥῖνα τάμῃσι καὶ οὔατα νηλέϊ χαλκῷ, μήδεά τʼ ἐξερύσας δώῃ κυσὶν ὠμὰ δάσασθαι. ὣς φάτο, τῷ δʼ ἔτι μᾶλλον ὑπὸ τρόμος ἔλλαβε γυῖα. ἐς μέσσον δʼ ἄναγον· τὼ δʼ ἄμφω χεῖρας ἀνέσχον.
 Then deeply moved didst thou speak to him, swineherd Eumaeus: “Ah me, stranger, why has such a thought come into thy mind? Verily thou art fain utterly to perish there, if thou wouldest indeed enter the throng of the wooers, whose wantonness and violence reach the iron heaven.	δὴ τότε μερμήριξε πολύτλας δῖος Ὀδυσσεὺς ἢ ἐλάσειʼ ὥς μιν ψυχὴ λίποι αὖθι πεσόντα, ἦέ μιν ἦκʼ ἐλάσειε τανύσσειέν τʼ ἐπὶ γαίῃ. ὧδε δέ οἱ φρονέοντι δοάσσατο κέρδιον εἶναι, ἦκʼ ἐλάσαι, ἵνα μή μιν ἐπιφρασσαίατʼ Ἀχαιοί.
 Not such as thou are their serving men; nay, they that serve them are young men, well clad in cloaks and tunics, and ever are their heads and bright faces sleek; and polished tables are laden with bread, and meat, and wine.	δὴ τότʼ ἀνασχομένω ὁ μὲν ἤλασε δεξιὸν ὦμον Ἶρος, ὁ δʼ αὐχένʼ ἔλασσεν ὑπʼ οὔατος, ὀστέα δʼ εἴσω ἔθλασεν· αὐτίκα δʼ ἦλθε κατὰ στόμα φοίνιον αἷμα, κὰδ δʼ ἔπεσʼ ἐν κονίῃσι μακών, σὺν δʼ ἤλασʼ ὀδόντας λακτίζων ποσὶ γαῖαν· ἀτὰρ μνηστῆρες ἀγαυοὶ
Nay, abide here; there is none that is vexed by thy presence, not I, nor any other of the men that are with me. But when the dear son of Odysseus comes, he will himself clothe thee in a cloak and a tunic as raiment, and will send thee whithersoever thy heart and spirit bid thee go.”	χεῖρας ἀνασχόμενοι γέλῳ ἔκθανον. αὐτὰρ Ὀδυσσεὺς ἕλκε διὲκ προθύροιο λαβὼν ποδός, ὄφρʼ ἵκετʼ αὐλήν, αἰθούσης τε θύρας· καί μιν ποτὶ ἑρκίον αὐλῆς εἷσεν ἀνακλίνας· σκῆπτρον δέ οἱ ἔμβαλε χειρί, καί μιν φωνήσας ἔπεα πτερόεντα προσηύδα·
 Then the much-enduring, goodly Odysseus answered him: “Would, Eumaeus, that thou mightest be as dear to father Zeus as thou art to me, for that thou hast made me cease from wandering and from grievous hardships. Than roaming naught else is more evil for mortals; yet for their cursed belly's sake	ἐνταυθοῖ νῦν ἧσο σύας τε κύνας τʼ ἀπερύκων, μηδὲ σύ γε ξείνων καὶ πτωχῶν κοίρανος εἶναι λυγρὸς ἐών, μή πού τι κακὸν καὶ μεῖζον ἐπαύρῃ. ἦ ῥα καὶ ἀμφʼ ὤμοισιν ἀεικέα βάλλετο πήρην, πυκνὰ ῥωγαλέην· ἐν δὲ στρόφος ἦεν ἀορτήρ.
 men endure evil woes, when wandering and sorrow and pain come upon them. But now, since thou keepest me here and biddest me await thy master, come, tell me of the mother of godlike Odysseus, and of the father, whom, when he went forth, he left behind him on the threshold of old age. Are they haply still living beneath the rays of the sun?	ἂψ δʼ ὅ γʼ ἐπʼ οὐδὸν ἰὼν κατʼ ἄρʼ ἕζετο· τοὶ δʼ ἴσαν εἴσω ἡδὺ γελώοντες καὶ δεικανόωντʼ ἐπέεσσι· Ζεύς τοι δοίη, ξεῖνε, καὶ ἀθάνατοι θεοὶ ἄλλοι, ὅττι μάλιστʼ ἐθέλεις καί τοι φίλον ἔπλετο θυμῷ, ὃς τοῦτον τὸν ἄναλτον ἀλητεύειν ἀπέπαυσας
or are they now dead and in the house of Hades?” Then the swineherd, a leader of men, answered him: “Then verily, stranger, will I frankly tell thee. Laertes still lives, but ever prays to Zeus that his life may waste away from his limbs within his halls.	ἐν δήμῳ· τάχα γάρ μιν ἀνάξομεν ἤπειρόνδε εἰς Ἔχετον βασιλῆα, βροτῶν δηλήμονα πάντων. ὣς ἄρʼ ἔφαν, χαῖρεν δὲ κλεηδόνι δῖος Ὀδυσσεύς. Ἀντίνοος δʼ ἄρα οἱ μεγάλην παρὰ γαστέρα θῆκεν, ἐμπλείην κνίσης τε καὶ αἵματος· Ἀμφίνομος δὲ
 For wondrously does he grieve for his son that is gone, and for the wise lady, his wedded wife, whose death troubled him most of all, and brought him to untimely old age. But she died of grief for her glorious son by a miserable death, as I would that no man may die	ἄρτους ἐκ κανέοιο δύω παρέθηκεν ἀείρας καὶ δέπαϊ χρυσέῳ δειδίσκετο, φώνησέν τε· χαῖρε, πάτερ ὦ ξεῖνε, γένοιτό τοι ἔς περ ὀπίσσω ὄλβος· ἀτὰρ μὲν νῦν γε κακοῖς ἔχεαι πολέεσσι. τὸν δʼ ἀπαμειβόμενος προσέφη πολύμητις Ὀδυσσεύς·
 who dwells here as my friend and does me kindness. So long as she lived, though it was in sorrow, it was ever a pleasure to me to ask and enquire after her, for she herself had brought me up with long-robed Ctimene, her noble daughter, whom she bore as her youngest child.	Ἀμφίνομʼ, ἦ μάλα μοι δοκέεις πεπνυμένος εἶναι· τοίου γὰρ καὶ πατρός, ἐπεὶ κλέος ἐσθλὸν ἄκουον, Νῖσον Δουλιχιῆα ἐΰν τʼ ἔμεν ἀφνειόν τε· τοῦ σʼ ἔκ φασι γενέσθαι, ἐπητῇ δʼ ἀνδρὶ ἔοικας. τοὔνεκά τοι ἐρέω, σὺ δὲ σύνθεο καί μευ ἄκουσον·
 With her was I brought up, and the mother honored me little less than her own children. But when we both reached the longed-for prime of youth they sent her to Same to wed, and got themselves countless bridal gifts, but as for me, my lady clad me in a cloak and tunic, right goodly raiment, and gave me sandals for my feet	οὐδὲν ἀκιδνότερον γαῖα τρέφει ἀνθρώποιο, πάντων ὅσσα τε γαῖαν ἔπι πνείει τε καὶ ἕρπει. οὐ μὲν γάρ ποτέ φησι κακὸν πείσεσθαι ὀπίσσω, ὄφρʼ ἀρετὴν παρέχωσι θεοὶ καὶ γούνατʼ ὀρώρῃ· ἀλλʼ ὅτε δὴ καὶ λυγρὰ θεοὶ μάκαρες τελέσωσι,
 and sent me forth to the field; but in her heart she loved me the more. But now I lack all this, though for my own part the blessed gods make to prosper the work to which I give heed. Therefrom have I eaten and drunk, and given to reverend strangers. But from my mistress I may hear naught pleasant,	καὶ τὰ φέρει ἀεκαζόμενος τετληότι θυμῷ· τοῖος γὰρ νόος ἐστὶν ἐπιχθονίων ἀνθρώπων οἷον ἐπʼ ἦμαρ ἄγησι πατὴρ ἀνδρῶν τε θεῶν τε. καὶ γὰρ ἐγώ ποτʼ ἔμελλον ἐν ἀνδράσιν ὄλβιος εἶναι, πολλὰ δʼ ἀτάσθαλʼ ἔρεξα βίῃ καὶ κάρτεϊ εἴκων,
whether word or deed, for a plague has fallen upon the house, even overweening men. Yet greatly do servants long to speak before their mistress, and learn of all, and to eat and drink, and thereafter to carry off somewhat also to the fields, such things as ever make the heart of a servant to grow warm.”	πατρί τʼ ἐμῷ πίσυνος καὶ ἐμοῖσι κασιγνήτοισι. τῷ μή τίς ποτε πάμπαν ἀνὴρ ἀθεμίστιος εἴη, ἀλλʼ ὅ γε σιγῇ δῶρα θεῶν ἔχοι, ὅττι διδοῖεν. οἷʼ ὁρόω μνηστῆρας ἀτάσθαλα μηχανόωντας, κτήματα κείροντας καὶ ἀτιμάζοντας ἄκοιτιν
 Then Odysseus of many wiles answered him, and said: “Lo now, surely when thou wast but a child, swineherd Eumaeus, thou didst wander far from thy country and thy parents. But come now, tell me this, and declare it truly. Was a broad-wayed city of men sacked,	ἀνδρός, ὃν οὐκέτι φημὶ φίλων καὶ πατρίδος αἴης δηρὸν ἀπέσσεσθαι· μάλα δὲ σχεδόν. ἀλλά σε δαίμων οἴκαδʼ ὑπεξαγάγοι, μηδʼ ἀντιάσειας ἐκείνῳ, ὁππότε νοστήσειε φίλην ἐς πατρίδα γαῖαν· οὐ γὰρ ἀναιμωτί γε διακρινέεσθαι ὀΐω
wherein thy father and honored mother dwelt? Or, when thou wast alone with thy sheep or cattle, did foemen take thee in their ships and bear thee for sale to the house of this thy master, who paid for thee a goodly price?” Then the swineherd, a leader of men, answered him:	μνηστῆρας καὶ κεῖνον, ἐπεί κε μέλαθρον ὑπέλθῃ. ὣς φάτο, καὶ σπείσας ἔπιεν μελιηδέα οἶνον, ἂψ δʼ ἐν χερσὶν ἔθηκε δέπας κοσμήτορι λαῶν. αὐτὰρ ὁ βῆ διὰ δῶμα φίλον τετιημένος ἦτορ, νευστάζων κεφαλῇ· δὴ γὰρ κακὸν ὄσσετο θυμός.
 “Stranger, since thou dost ask and question me of this, hearken now in silence, and take thy joy, and drink thy wine, as thou sittest here. These nights are wondrous long. There is time for sleep, and there is time to take joy in hearing tales; thou needest not lay thee down till it be time; there is weariness even in too much sleep.	ἀλλʼ οὐδʼ ὣς φύγε κῆρα· πέδησε δὲ καὶ τὸν Ἀθήνη Τηλεμάχου ὑπὸ χερσὶ καὶ ἔγχεϊ ἶφι δαμῆναι. ἂψ δʼ αὖτις κατʼ ἄρʼ ἕζετʼ ἐπὶ θρόνου ἔνθεν ἀνέστη. τῇ δʼ ἄρʼ ἐπὶ φρεσὶ θῆκε θεὰ γλαυκῶπις Ἀθήνη, κούρῃ Ἰκαρίοιο, περίφρονι Πηνελοπείῃ,
 As for the rest, if any man's heart and spirit bid him, let him go forth and sleep, and at daybreak let him eat, and follow our master's swine. But we two will drink and feast in the hut, and will take delight each in the other's grievous woes,	μνηστήρεσσι φανῆναι, ὅπως πετάσειε μάλιστα θυμὸν μνηστήρων ἰδὲ τιμήεσσα γένοιτο μᾶλλον πρὸς πόσιός τε καὶ υἱέος ἢ πάρος ἦεν. ἀχρεῖον δʼ ἐγέλασσεν ἔπος τʼ ἔφατʼ ἔκ τʼ ὀνόμαζεν· Εὐρυνόμη, θυμός μοι ἐέλδεται, οὔ τι πάρος γε,
as we recall them to mind. For in after time a man finds joy even in woes, whosoever has suffered much, and wandered much. But this will I tell thee, of which thou dost ask and enquire. “There is an isle called Syria , if haply thou hast heard thereof, above Ortygia, where are the turning-places of the sun.	μνηστήρεσσι φανῆναι, ἀπεχθομένοισί περ ἔμπης· παιδὶ δέ κεν εἴποιμι ἔπος, τό κε κέρδιον εἴη, μὴ πάντα μνηστῆρσιν ὑπερφιάλοισιν ὁμιλεῖν, οἵ τʼ εὖ μὲν βάζουσι, κακῶς δʼ ὄπιθεν φρονέουσι. τὴν δʼ αὖτʼ Εὐρυνόμη ταμίη πρὸς μῦθον ἔειπεν·
 It is not so very thickly settled, but it is a good land, rich in herds, rich in flocks, full of wine, abounding in wheat. Famine never comes into the land, nor does any hateful sickness besides fall on wretched mortals; but when the tribes of men grow old throughout the city,	ναὶ δὴ ταῦτά γε πάντα, τέκος, κατὰ μοῖραν ἔειπες. ἀλλʼ ἴθι καὶ σῷ παιδὶ ἔπος φάο μηδʼ ἐπίκευθε, χρῶτʼ ἀπονιψαμένη καὶ ἐπιχρίσασα παρειάς· μηδʼ οὕτω δακρύοισι πεφυρμένη ἀμφὶ πρόσωπα ἔρχευ, ἐπεὶ κάκιον πενθήμεναι ἄκριτον αἰεί.
Apollo, of the silver bow, comes with Artemis, and assails them with his gentle shafts, and slays them. In that isle are two cities, and all the land is divided between them, and over both ruled as king my father, Ctesius, son of Ormenus, a man like to the immortals.	ἤδη μὲν γάρ τοι παῖς τηλίκος, ὃν σὺ μάλιστα ἠρῶ ἀθανάτοισι γενειήσαντα ἰδέσθαι. τὴν δʼ αὖτε προσέειπε περίφρων Πηνελόπεια· Εὐρυνόμη, μὴ ταῦτα παραύδα, κηδομένη περ, χρῶτʼ ἀπονίπτεσθαι καὶ ἐπιχρίεσθαι ἀλοιφῇ·
 “Thither came Phoenicians, men famed for their ships, greedy knaves, bringing countless trinkets in their black ship. Now there was in my father's house a Phoenician woman, comely and tall, and skilled in glorious handiwork. Her the wily Phoenicians beguiled.	ἀγλαΐην γὰρ ἐμοί γε θεοί, τοὶ Ὄλυμπον ἔχουσιν, ὤλεσαν, ἐξ οὗ κεῖνος ἔβη κοίλῃς ἐνὶ νηυσίν. ἀλλά μοι Αὐτονόην τε καὶ Ἱπποδάμειαν ἄνωχθι ἐλθέμεν, ὄφρα κέ μοι παρστήετον ἐν μεγάροισιν· οἴη δʼ οὐκ εἴσειμι μετʼ ἀνέρας· αἰδέομαι γάρ.
First, as she was washing clothes, one of them lay with her in love by the hollow ship; for this beguiles the minds of women, even though one be upright. Then he asked her who she was, and whence she came, and she straightway shewed him the high-roofed home of my father, and said:	ὣς ἄρʼ ἔφη, γρηῢς δὲ διὲκ μεγάροιο βεβήκει ἀγγελέουσα γυναιξὶ καὶ ὀτρυνέουσα νέεσθαι. ἔνθʼ αὖτʼ ἄλλʼ ἐνόησε θεὰ γλαυκῶπις Ἀθήνη· κούρῃ Ἰκαρίοιο κατὰ γλυκὺν ὕπνον ἔχευεν, εὗδε δʼ ἀνακλινθεῖσα, λύθεν δέ οἱ ἅψεα πάντα
“‘Out of Sidon , rich in bronze, I declare that I come, and I am the daughter of Arybas, to whom wealth flowed in streams. But Taphian pirates seized me, as I was coming from the fields, and brought me hither, and sold me to the house of yonder man, and he paid for me a goodly price.’	αὐτοῦ ἐνὶ κλιντῆρι· τέως δʼ ἄρα δῖα θεάων ἄμβροτα δῶρα δίδου, ἵνα μιν θησαίατʼ Ἀχαιοί. κάλλεϊ μέν οἱ πρῶτα προσώπατα καλὰ κάθηρεν ἀμβροσίῳ, οἵῳ περ ἐϋστέφανος Κυθέρεια χρίεται, εὖτʼ ἂν ἴῃ Χαρίτων χορὸν ἱμερόεντα·
“Then the man who had lain with her in secret answered her: ‘Wouldest thou then return again with us to thy home, that thou mayest see the high-roofed house of thy father and mother, and see them too? For of a truth they yet live, and are accounted rich.’ “Then the woman answered him, and said:	καί μιν μακροτέρην καὶ πάσσονα θῆκεν ἰδέσθαι, λευκοτέρην δʼ ἄρα μιν θῆκε πριστοῦ ἐλέφαντος. ἡ μὲν ἄρʼ ὣς ἔρξασʼ ἀπεβήσετο δῖα θεάων, ἦλθον δʼ ἀμφίπολοι λευκώλενοι ἐκ μεγάροιο φθόγγῳ ἐπερχόμεναι· τὴν δὲ γλυκὺς ὕπνος ἀνῆκε,
‘This may well be, if you sailors will pledge yourselves by an oath, that you will bring me safely home.’ “So she spoke, and they all gave an oath thereto, as she bade them. But when they had sworn and made an end of the oath, the woman again spoke among them, and made answer:	καί ῥʼ ἀπομόρξατο χερσὶ παρειὰς φώνησέν τε· ἦ με μάλʼ αἰνοπαθῆ μαλακὸν περὶ κῶμʼ ἐκάλυψεν. αἴθε μοι ὣς μαλακὸν θάνατον πόροι Ἄρτεμις ἁγνὴ αὐτίκα νῦν, ἵνα μηκέτʼ ὀδυρομένη κατὰ θυμὸν αἰῶνα φθινύθω, πόσιος ποθέουσα φίλοιο
 “‘Be silent now, and let no one of your company speak to me, if he meets me in the street or haply at the well, lest some one go to the palace and tell the old king, and he wax suspicious and bind me with grievous bonds, and devise death for you.	παντοίην ἀρετήν, ἐπεὶ ἔξοχος ἦεν Ἀχαιῶν. ὣς φαμένη κατέβαινʼ ὑπερώϊα σιγαλόεντα, οὐκ οἴη· ἅμα τῇ γε καὶ ἀμφίπολοι δύʼ ἕποντο. ἡ δʼ ὅτε δὴ μνηστῆρας ἀφίκετο δῖα γυναικῶν, στῆ ῥα παρὰ σταθμὸν τέγεος πύκα ποιητοῖο,
 Nay, keep my words in mind, and speed the barter of your wares. But, when your ship is laden with goods, let a message come quickly to me at the palace; for I will also bring whatever gold comes under my hand. Aye, and I would gladly give another thing for my passage.	ἄντα παρειάων σχομένη λιπαρὰ κρήδεμνα· ἀμφίπολος δʼ ἄρα οἱ κεδνὴ ἑκάτερθε παρέστη. τῶν δʼ αὐτοῦ λύτο γούνατʼ, ἔρῳ δʼ ἄρα θυμὸν ἔθελχθεν, πάντες δʼ ἠρήσαντο παραὶ λεχέεσσι κλιθῆναι. ἡ δʼ αὖ Τηλέμαχον προσεφώνεεν, ὃν φίλον υἱόν·
There is a child of my noble master, whose nurse I am in the palace, such a cunning child, who ever runs abroad with me. Him would I bring on board, and he would fetch you a vast price, wherever you might take him for sale among men of strange speech.’ “So saying, she departed to the fair palace.	Τηλέμαχʼ, οὐκέτι τοι φρένες ἔμπεδοι οὐδὲ νόημα· παῖς ἔτʼ ἐὼν καὶ μᾶλλον ἐνὶ φρεσὶ κέρδεʼ ἐνώμας· νῦν δʼ, ὅτε δὴ μέγας ἐσσὶ καὶ ἥβης μέτρον ἱκάνεις, καί κέν τις φαίη γόνον ἔμμεναι ὀλβίου ἀνδρός, ἐς μέγεθος καὶ κάλλος ὁρώμενος, ἀλλότριος φώς,
 And they remained there in our land a full year, and got by trade much substance in their hollow ship. But when their hollow ship was laden for their return, then they sent a messenger to bear tidings to the woman. There came a man, well versed in guile, to my father's house	οὐκέτι τοι φρένες εἰσὶν ἐναίσιμοι οὐδὲ νόημα. οἷον δὴ τόδε ἔργον ἐνὶ μεγάροισιν ἐτύχθη, ὃς τὸν ξεῖνον ἔασας ἀεικισθήμεναι οὕτως. πῶς νῦν, εἴ τι ξεῖνος ἐν ἡμετέροισι δόμοισιν ἥμενος ὧδε πάθοι ῥυστακτύος ἐξ ἀλεγεινῆς;
 with a necklace of gold, and with amber beads was it strung between. This the maidens in the hall and my honored mother were handling, and were gazing on it, and were offering him their price; but he nodded to the woman in silence. Then verily when he had nodded to her, he went his way to the hollow ship,	σοί κʼ αἶσχος λώβη τε μετʼ ἀνθρώποισι πέλοιτο. τὴν δʼ αὖ Τηλέμαχος πεπνυμένος ἀντίον ηὔδα· μῆτερ ἐμή, τὸ μὲν οὔ σε νεμεσσῶμαι κεχολῶσθαι· αὐτὰρ ἐγὼ θυμῷ νοέω καὶ οἶδα ἕκαστα, ἐσθλά τε καὶ τὰ χέρεια· πάρος δʼ ἔτι νήπιος ἦα.
 but she took me by the hand, and led me forth from the house. Now in the fore-hall of the palace she found the cups and tables of the banqueters, who waited upon my father. They had gone forth to the council and the people's place of debate, but she quickly hid three goblets in her bosom,	ἀλλά τοι οὐ δύναμαι πεπνυμένα πάντα νοῆσαι· ἐκ γάρ με πλήσσουσι παρήμενοι ἄλλοθεν ἄλλος οἵδε κακὰ φρονέοντες, ἐμοὶ δʼ οὐκ εἰσὶν ἀρωγοί. οὐ μέν τοι ξείνου γε καὶ Ἴρου μῶλος ἐτύχθη μνηστήρων ἰότητι, βίῃ δʼ ὅ γε φέρτερος ἦεν.
 and bore them away; and I followed in my heedlessness. Then the sun set, and all the ways grew dark. And we made haste and came to the goodly harbor, where was the swift ship of the Phoenicians. Then they embarked,	αἲ γάρ, Ζεῦ τε πάτερ καὶ Ἀθηναίη καὶ Ἄπολλον, οὕτω νῦν μνηστῆρες ἐν ἡμετέροισι δόμοισι νεύοιεν κεφαλὰς δεδμημένοι, οἱ μὲν ἐν αὐλῇ, οἱ δʼ ἔντοσθε δόμοιο, λελῦτο δὲ γυῖα ἑκάστου, ὡς νῦν Ἶρος κεῖνος ἐπʼ αὐλείῃσι θύρῃσιν
 putting both of us on board as well, and sailed over the watery ways, and Zeus sent them a favorable wind. For six days we sailed, night and day alike; but when Zeus, son of Cronos, brought upon us the seventh day, then Artemis, the archer, smote the woman, and she fell with a thud into the hold, as a sea bird plunges.	ἧσται νευστάζων κεφαλῇ, μεθύοντι ἐοικώς, οὐδʼ ὀρθὸς στῆναι δύναται ποσὶν οὐδὲ νέεσθαι οἴκαδʼ, ὅπη οἱ νόστος, ἐπεὶ φίλα γυῖα λέλυνται. ὣς οἱ μὲν τοιαῦτα πρὸς ἀλλήλους ἀγόρευον· Εὐρύμαχος δʼ ἐπέεσσι προσηύδα Πηνελόπειαν·
Her they cast forth to be a prey to seals and fishes, but I was left, my heart sore stricken. Now the wind, as it bore them, and the wave, brought them to Ithaca , where Laertes bought me with his wealth. Thus it was that my eyes beheld this land.”	κούρη Ἰκαρίοιο, περίφρον Πηνελόπεια, εἰ πάντες σε ἴδοιεν ἀνʼ Ἴασον Ἄργος Ἀχαιοί, πλέονές κε μνηστῆρες ἐν ὑμετέροισι δόμοισιν ἠῶθεν δαινύατʼ, ἐπεὶ περίεσσι γυναικῶν εἶδός τε μέγεθός τε ἰδὲ φρένας ἔνδον ἐΐσας.
 To him then Zeus-born Odysseus made answer, and said: “Eumaeus, of a truth thou hast deeply stirred the heart in my breast in telling all this tale of the sorrow thou hast borne at heart. Yet verily in thy case Zeus has given good side by side with the evil, since after all thy toil thou hast come to the house of	τὸν δʼ ἠμείβετʼ ἔπειτα περίφρων Πηνελόπεια· Εὐρύμαχʼ, ἦ τοι ἐμὴν ἀρετὴν εἶδός τε δέμας τε ὤλεσαν ἀθάνατοι, ὅτε Ἴλιον εἰσανέβαινον Ἀργεῖοι, μετὰ τοῖσι δʼ ἐμὸς πόσις ᾖεν Ὀδυσσεύς. εἰ κεῖνός γʼ ἐλθὼν τὸν ἐμὸν βίον ἀμφιπολεύοι,
a kindly man, who gives thee food and drink, and that with kindness, and thou livest well; while as for me, it is while wandering through the many cities of men that I am come hither.” Thus they spoke to one another, and then lay down to sleep, for no long time, but for a little;	μεῖζόν κε κλέος εἴη ἐμὸν καὶ κάλλιον οὕτως. νῦν δʼ ἄχομαι· τόσα γάρ μοι ἐπέσσευεν κακὰ δαίμων. ἦ μὲν δὴ ὅτε τʼ ᾖε λιπὼν κάτα πατρίδα γαῖαν, δεξιτερὴν ἐπὶ καρπῷ ἑλὼν ἐμὲ χεῖρα προσηύδα· ὦ γύναι, οὐ γὰρ ὀΐω ἐϋκνήμιδας Ἀχαιοὺς
 for soon came fair-throned Dawn. But the comrades of Telemachus, drawing near the shore, furled the sail, and took down the mast quickly, and rowed the ship to her anchorage with their oars. Then they cast out the mooring-stones and made fast the stern cables, and themselves went forth upon the shore of the sea,	ἐκ Τροίης εὖ πάντας ἀπήμονας ἀπονέεσθαι· καὶ γὰρ Τρῶάς φασι μαχητὰς ἔμμεναι ἄνδρας, ἠμὲν ἀκοντιστὰς ἠδὲ ῥυτῆρας ὀϊστῶν ἵππων τʼ ὠκυπόδων ἐπιβήτορας, οἵ κε τάχιστα ἔκριναν μέγα νεῖκος ὁμοιΐου πολέμοιο.
and made ready their meal and mixed the flaming wine. But when they had put from them the desire of food and drink, among them wise Telemachus was the first to speak, saying: “Do you now row the black ship to the city, but I will visit the fields and the herdsmen,	τῷ οὐκ οἶδʼ ἤ κέν μʼ ἀνέσει θεός, ἦ κεν ἁλώω αὐτοῦ ἐνὶ Τροίῃ· σοὶ δʼ ἐνθάδε πάντα μελόντων. μεμνῆσθαι πατρὸς καὶ μητέρος ἐν μεγάροισιν ὡς νῦν, ἢ ἔτι μᾶλλον ἐμεῦ ἀπονόσφιν ἐόντος· αὐτὰρ ἐπὴν δὴ παῖδα γενειήσαντα ἴδηαι,
and at evening will come to the city when I have looked over my lands. And in the morning I will set before you, as wages for your journey, a good feast of flesh and sweet wine.” Then godlike Theoclymenus answered him: “Whither shall I go, dear child? To whose house shall I come	γήμασθʼ ᾧ κʼ ἐθέλῃσθα, τεὸν κατὰ δῶμα λιποῦσα. κεῖνος τὼς ἀγόρευε· τὰ δὴ νῦν πάντα τελεῖται. νὺξ δʼ ἔσται ὅτε δὴ στυγερὸς γάμος ἀντιβολήσει οὐλομένης ἐμέθεν, τῆς τε Ζεὺς ὄλβον ἀπηύρα. ἀλλὰ τόδʼ αἰνὸν ἄχος κραδίην καὶ θυμὸν ἱκάνει·
of those who rule in rocky Ithaca ? Or shall I go straight to thy mother's house and thine?” Then wise Telemachus answered him: “Were things otherwise, I should bid thee go even to our house, for there is in no wise lack of entertainment for strangers, but	μνηστήρων οὐχ ἥδε δίκη τὸ πάροιθε τέτυκτο· οἵ τʼ ἀγαθήν τε γυναῖκα καὶ ἀφνειοῖο θύγατρα μνηστεύειν ἐθέλωσι καὶ ἀλλήλοις ἐρίσωσιν, αὐτοὶ τοί γʼ ἀπάγουσι βόας καὶ ἴφια μῆλα, κούρης δαῖτα φίλοισι, καὶ ἀγλαὰ δῶρα διδοῦσιν·
 it would be worse for thyself, since I shall be away, and my mother will not see thee. For she does not often appear before the wooers in the house, but apart from them weaves at her loom in an upper chamber. But I will tell thee of another man to whom thou mayest go, Eurymachus, glorious son of wise Polybus,	ἀλλʼ οὐκ ἀλλότριον βίοτον νήποινον ἔδουσιν. ὣς φάτο, γήθησεν δὲ πολύτλας δῖος Ὀδυσσεύς, οὕνεκα τῶν μὲν δῶρα παρέλκετο, θέλγε δὲ θυμὸν μειλιχίοις ἐπέεσσι, νόος δέ οἱ ἄλλα μενοίνα. τὴν δʼ αὖτʼ Ἀντίνοος προσέφη, Εὐπείθεος υἱός,
whom now the men of Ithaca look upon as on a god. For he is by far the best man, and is most eager to marry my mother and to have the honor of Odysseus. Nevertheless Olympian Zeus, who dwells in the sky, knows this, whether or not before marriage he will fulfil for them the evil day.”	κούρη Ἰκαρίοιο, περίφρον Πηνελόπεια, δῶρα μὲν ὅς κʼ ἐθέλῃσιν Ἀχαιῶν ἐνθάδʼ ἐνεῖκαι, δέξασθʼ. οὐ γὰρ καλὸν ἀνήνασθαι δόσιν ἐστίν· ἡμεῖς δʼ οὔτʼ ἐπὶ ἔργα πάρος γʼ ἴμεν οὔτε πῃ ἄλλῃ, πρίν γέ σε τῷ γήμασθαι Ἀχαιῶν ὅς τις ἄριστος.
 Even as he spoke a bird flew forth upon the right, a hawk, the swift messenger of Apollo. In his talons he held a dove, and was plucking her and shedding the feathers down on the ground midway between the ship and Telemachus himself. Then Theoclymenus called him apart from his companions,	ὣς ἔφατʼ Ἀντίνοος, τοῖσιν δʼ ἐπιήνδανε μῦθος· δῶρα δʼ ἄρʼ οἰσέμεναι πρόεσαν κήρυκα ἕκαστος. Ἀντινόῳ μὲν ἔνεικε μέγαν περικαλλέα πέπλον, ποικίλον· ἐν δʼ ἀρʼ ἔσαν περόναι δυοκαίδεκα πᾶσαι χρύσειαι, κληῗσιν ἐϋγνάμπτοις ἀραρυῖαι.
and clasped his hand, and spoke, and addressed him: “Telemachus, surely not without a god's warrant has this bird flown forth upon our right, for I knew, as I looked upon him, that he was a bird of omen. Than yours is no other house in the land of Ithaca more kingly; nay, ye are ever supreme.”	ὅρμον δʼ Εὐρυμάχῳ πολυδαίδαλον αὐτίκʼ ἔνεικε. χρύσεον, ἠλέκτροισιν ἐερμένον ἠέλιον ὥς. ἕρματα δʼ Εὐρυδάμαντι δύω θεράποντες ἔνεικαν, τρίγληνα μορόεντα· χάρις δʼ ἀπελάμπετο πολλή. ἐκ δʼ ἄρα Πεισάνδροιο Πολυκτορίδαο ἄνακτος
Then wise Telemachus answered him again: “Ah, stranger, I would that this word of thine might be fulfilled. Then shouldest thou straightway know of kindness and many a gift from me, so that one that met thee would call thee blessed.” Therewith he spoke to Peiraeus, his trusty comrade:	ἴσθμιον ἤνεικεν θεράπων, περικαλλὲς ἄγαλμα. ἄλλο δʼ ἄρʼ ἄλλος δῶρον Ἀχαιῶν καλὸν ἔνεικεν. ἡ μὲν ἔπειτʼ ἀνέβαινʼ ὑπερώϊα δῖα γυναικῶν, τῇ δʼ ἄρʼ ἅμʼ ἀμφίπολοι ἔφερον περικαλλέα δῶρα οἱ δʼ εἰς ὀρχηστύν τε καὶ ἱμερόεσσαν ἀοιδὴν
“Peiraeus, son of Clytius, it is thou that in other matters art wont to hearken to me above all my comrades, who went with me to Pylos ; so now do thou, I pray thee, take this stranger and give him kindly welcome in thy house, and show him honor until I come.”	τρεψάμενοι τέρποντο, μένον δʼ ἐπὶ ἕσπερον ἐλθεῖν. τοῖσι δὲ τερπομένοισι μέλας ἐπὶ ἕσπερος ἦλθεν. αὐτίκα λαμπτῆρας τρεῖς ἵστασαν ἐν μεγάροισιν, ὄφρα φαείνοιεν· περὶ δὲ ξύλα κάγκανα θῆκαν, αὖα πάλαι, περίκηλα, νέον κεκεασμένα χαλκῷ,
Then Peiraeus, the famous spearman, answered him: “Telemachus, though thou shouldest stay here long, I will entertain him, and he shall have no lack of what is due to strangers.” So saying, he went on board the ship, and bade his comrades themselves to embark and to loose the stern cables. So they went on board straightway, and sat down upon the benches.	καὶ δαΐδας μετέμισγον· ἀμοιβηδὶς δʼ ἀνέφαινον δμῳαὶ Ὀδυσσῆος ταλασίφρονος. αὐτὰρ ὁ τῇσιν αὐτὸς διογενῆς μετέφη πολύμητις Ὀδυσσεύς· δμῳαὶ Ὀδυσσῆος, δὴν οἰχομένοιο ἄνακτος, ἔρχεσθε πρὸς δώμαθʼ, ἵνʼ αἰδοίη βασίλεια·
 But Telemachus bound beneath his feet his fair sandals, and took his mighty spear, tipped with sharp bronze, from the deck of the ship. Then the men loosed the stern cables, and thrusting off, sailed to the city, as Telemachus bade, the dear son of divine Odysseus.	τῇ δὲ παρʼ ἠλάκατα στροφαλίζετε, τέρπετε δʼ αὐτὴν ἥμεναι ἐν μεγάρῳ, ἢ εἴρια πείκετε χερσίν· αὐτὰρ ἐγὼ τούτοισι φάος πάντεσσι παρέξω. ἤν περ γάρ κʼ ἐθέλωσιν ἐΰθρονον Ἠῶ μίμνειν, οὔ τί με νικήσουσι· πολυτλήμων δὲ μάλʼ εἰμί.
 But his feet bore him swiftly on, as he strode forward, until he reached the farmstead where were his countless swine, among whom slept the worthy swineherd with a heart loyal to his masters.	ὣς ἔφαθʼ, αἱ δʼ ἐγέλασσαν, ἐς ἀλλήλας δὲ ἴδοντο. τὸν δʼ αἰσχρῶς ἐνένιπε Μελανθὼ καλλιπάρῃος, τὴν Δολίος μὲν ἔτικτε, κόμισσε δὲ Πηνελόπεια, παῖδα δὲ ὣς ἀτίταλλε, δίδου δʼ ἄρʼ ἀθύρματα θυμῷ· ἀλλʼ οὐδʼ ὣς ἔχε πένθος ἐνὶ φρεσὶ Πηνελοπείης,
 Meanwhile the two in the hut, Odysseus and the goodly swineherd, had kindled a fire, and were making ready their breakfast at dawn, and had sent forth the herdsmen with the droves of swine; but around Telemachus the baying hounds fawned,	θαρσαλέως πολλοῖσι μετʼ ἀνδράσιν, οὐδέ τι θυμῷ ταρβεῖς· ἦ ῥά σε οἶνος ἔχει φρένας, ἤ νύ τοι αἰεὶ τοιοῦτος νόος ἐστίν· ὃ καὶ μεταμώνια βάζεις. ἦ ἀλύεις, ὅτι Ἶρον ἐνίκησας τὸν ἀλήτην; μή τίς τοι τάχα Ἴρου ἀμείνων ἄλλος ἀναστῇ,
and barked not as he drew near. And goodly Odysseus noted the fawning of the hounds, and the sound of footsteps fell upon his ears; and straightway he spoke to Eumaeus winged words: “Eumaeus, surely some comrade of thine will be coming, or at least some one thou knowest, for the hounds do not bark,	ὅς τίς σʼ ἀμφὶ κάρη κεκοπὼς χερσὶ στιβαρῇσι δώματος ἐκπέμψῃσι, φορύξας αἵματι πολλῷ. τὴν δʼ ἄρʼ ὑπόδρα ἰδὼν προσέφη πολύμητις Ὀδυσσεύς· ἦ τάχα Τηλεμάχῳ ἐρέω, κύον, οἷʼ ἀγορεύεις, κεῖσʼ ἐλθών, ἵνα σʼ αὖθι διὰ μελεϊστὶ τάμῃσιν.
but fawn about him, and I hear the sound of footsteps.” Not yet was the word fully uttered, when his own dear son stood in the doorway. In amazement up sprang the swineherd, and from his hands the vessels fell with which he was busied as he mixed the flaming wine. And he went to meet his lord,	ὣς εἰπὼν ἐπέεσσι διεπτοίησε γυναῖκας. βὰν δʼ ἴμεναι διὰ δῶμα, λύθεν δʼ ὑπὸ γυῖα ἑκάστης ταρβοσύνῃ· φὰν γάρ μιν ἀληθέα μυθήσασθαι. αὐτὰρ ὁ πὰρ λαμπτῆρσι φαείνων αἰθομένοισιν ἑστήκειν ἐς πάντας ὁρώμενος· ἄλλα δέ οἱ κῆρ
 and kissed his head and both his beautiful eyes and his two hands, and a big tear fell from him. And as a loving father greets his own dear son, who comes in the tenth year from a distant land—his only son and well-beloved, for whose sake he has borne much sorrow—	ὥρμαινε φρεσὶν ᾗσιν, ἅ ῥʼ οὐκ ἀτέλεστα γένοντο. μνηστῆρας δʼ οὐ πάμπαν ἀγήνορας εἴα Ἀθήνη λώβης ἴσχεσθαι θυμαλγέος, ὄφρʼ ἔτι μᾶλλον δύη ἄχος κραδίην Λαερτιάδεω Ὀδυσῆος. τοῖσιν δʼ Εὐρύμαχος, Πολύβου πάϊς, ἦρχʼ ἀγορεύειν,
even so did the goodly swineherd then clasp in his arms godlike Telemachus, and kiss him all over as one escaped from death; and with wailing he addressed him with winged words: “Thou art come, Telemachus, sweet light of my eyes. I thought I should never see thee more after thou hadst gone in thy ship to Pylos .	κερτομέων Ὀδυσῆα· γέλω δʼ ἑτάροισιν ἔτευχε. κέκλυτέ μευ, μνηστῆρες ἀγακλειτῆς βασιλείης, ὄφρʼ εἴπω τά με θυμὸς ἐνὶ στήθεσσι κελεύει. οὐκ ἀθεεὶ ὅδʼ ἀνὴρ Ὀδυσήϊον ἐς δόμον ἵκει· ἔμπης μοι δοκέει δαίδων σέλας ἔμμεναι αὐτοῦ
But come, enter in, dear child, that I may delight my heart with looking at thee here in my house, who art newly come from other lands. For thou dost not often visit the farm and the herdsmen, but abidest in the town; so, I ween, has it seemed good to thy heart, to look upon the destructive throng of the wooers.”	κὰκ κεφαλῆς, ἐπεὶ οὔ οἱ ἔνι τρίχες οὐδʼ ἠβαιαί. ἦ ῥʼ, ἅμα τε προσέειπεν Ὀδυσσῆα πτολίπορθον· ξεῖνʼ, ἦ ἄρ κʼ ἐθέλοις θητευέμεν, εἴ σʼ ἀνελοίμην, ἀγροῦ ἐπʼ ἐσχατιῆς—μισθὸς δέ τοι ἄρκιος ἔσται— αἱμασιάς τε λέγων καὶ δένδρεα μακρὰ φυτεύων;
 Then wise Telemachus answered him: “So shall it be, father. It is for thy sake that I am come hither, to see thee with my eyes, and to hear thee tell whether my mother still abides in the halls, or whether by now some other man has wedded her, and the couch of Odysseus	ἔνθα κʼ ἐγὼ σῖτον μὲν ἐπηετανὸν παρέχοιμι, εἵματα δʼ ἀμφιέσαιμι ποσίν θʼ ὑποδήματα δοίην. ἀλλʼ ἐπεὶ οὖν δὴ ἔργα κάκʼ ἔμμαθες, οὐκ ἐθελήσεις ἔργον ἐποίχεσθαι, ἀλλὰ πτώσσειν κατὰ δῆμον βούλεαι, ὄφρʼ ἄν ἔχῃς βόσκειν σὴν γαστέρʼ ἄναλτον.
So saying, he took from him the spear of bronze, and Telemachus went in and passed over the stone threshold. As he drew near, his father, Odysseus, rose from his seat and gave him place, but Telemachus on his part checked him, and said: “Be seated, stranger, and we shall find a seat elsewhere	τὸν δʼ ἀπαμειβόμενος προσέφη πολύμητις Ὀδυσσεύς· Εὐρύμαχʼ, εἰ γὰρ νῶϊν ἔρις ἔργοιο γένοιτο ὥρῃ ἐν εἰαρινῇ, ὅτε τʼ ἤματα μακρὰ πέλονται, ἐν ποίῃ, δρέπανον μὲν ἐγὼν εὐκαμπὲς ἔχοιμι, καὶ δὲ σὺ τοῖον ἔχοις, ἵνα πειρησαίμεθα ἔργου
in our farmstead. There is a man here who will set us one.” So he spoke, and Odysseus went back and sat down again, and for Telemachus the swineherd strewed green brushwood beneath and a fleece above it, and there the dear son of Odysseus sat down. Then the swineherd set before them platters	νήστιες ἄχρι μάλα κνέφαος, ποίη δὲ παρείη. εἰ δʼ αὖ καὶ βόες εἶεν ἐλαυνέμεν, οἵ περ ἄριστοι, αἴθωνες, μεγάλοι, ἄμφω κεκορηότε ποίης, ἥλικες, ἰσοφόροι, τῶν τε σθένος οὐκ ἀλαπαδνόν, τετράγυον δʼ εἴη, εἴκοι δʼ ὑπὸ βῶλος ἀρότρῳ·
 of roast meats, which they had left at their meal the day before, and quickly heaped up bread in baskets, and mixed in a bowl of ivy wood honey-sweet wine, and himself sat down over against divine Odysseus. So they put forth their hands to the good cheer lying ready before them.	τῷ κέ μʼ ἴδοις, εἰ ὦλκα διηνεκέα προταμοίμην. εἰ δʼ αὖ καὶ πόλεμόν ποθεν ὁρμήσειε Κρονίων σήμερον, αὐτὰρ ἐμοὶ σάκος εἴη καὶ δύο δοῦρε καὶ κυνέη πάγχαλκος, ἐπὶ κροτάφοις ἀραρυῖα, τῷ κέ μʼ ἴδοις πρώτοισιν ἐνὶ προμάχοισι μιγέντα,
But when they had put from them the desire of food and drink, Telemachus spoke to the goodly swineherd, and said: “Father, from whence did this stranger come to thee? How did sailors bring him to Ithaca ? Who did they declare themselves to be? For nowise, methinks, did he come hither on foot.”	οὐδʼ ἄν μοι τὴν γαστέρʼ ὀνειδίζων ἀγορεύοις. ἀλλὰ μάλʼ ὑβρίξεις, καί τοι νόος ἐστὶν ἀπηνής· καί πού τις δοκέεις μέγας ἔμμεναι ἠδὲ κραταιός, οὕνεκα πὰρ παύροισι καὶ οὐκ ἀγαθοῖσιν ὁμιλεῖς. εἰ δʼ Ὀδυσεὺς ἔλθοι καὶ ἵκοιτʼ ἐς πατρίδα γαῖαν,
To him then, swineherd Eumaeus, didst thou make answer, and say: “Then verily, my child, I will tell thee all the truth. From broad Crete he declares that he has birth, and he says that he has wandered roaming through many cities of mortals; so has a god spun for him this lot.	αἶψά κέ τοι τὰ θύρετρα, καὶ εὐρέα περ μάλʼ ἐόντα, φεύγοντι στείνοιτο διὲκ προθύροιο θύραζε. ὣς ἔφατʼ, Εὐρύμαχος δʼ ἐχολώσατο κηρόθι μᾶλλον, καί μιν ὑπόδρα ἰδὼν ἔπεα πτερόεντα προσηύδα· ἆ δείλʼ, ἦ τάχα τοι τελέω κακόν, οἷʼ ἀγορεύεις
But now he has run away from a ship of the Thesprotians and come to my farmstead, and I shall put him in thy hands. Do what thou wilt. He declares himself thy suppliant.” Then again wise Telemachus answered him: “Eumaeus, verily this word which thou hast uttered stings me to the heart.	θαρσαλέως πολλοῖσι μετʼ ἀνδράσιν, οὐδέ τι θυμῷ ταρβεῖς· ἦ ῥά σε οἶνος ἔχει φρένας, ἤ νύ τοι αἰεὶ τοιοῦτος νόος ἐστίν· ὃ καὶ μεταμώνια βάζεις. ἦ ἀλύεις, ὅτι Ἶρον ἐνίκησας τὸν ἀλήτην; ὣς ἄρα φωνήσας σφέλας ἔλλαβεν· αὐτὰρ Ὀδυσσεὺς
 For how am I to welcome this stranger in my house? I am myself but young, nor have I yet trust in my might to defend me against a man, when one waxes wroth without a cause. And as for my mother, the heart in her breast wavers this way and that, whether to abide here with me and keep the house,	Ἀμφινόμου πρὸς γοῦνα καθέζετο Δουλιχιῆος, Εὐρύμαχον δείσας· ὁ δʼ ἄρʼ οἰνοχόον βάλε χεῖρα δεξιτερήν· πρόχοος δὲ χαμαὶ βόμβησε πεσοῦσα, αὐτὰρ ὅ γʼ οἰμώξας πέσεν ὕπτιος ἐν κονίῃσι. μνηστῆρες δʼ ὁμάδησαν ἀνὰ μέγαρα σκιόεντα,
 respecting the bed of her husband and the voice of the people, or to go now with him whosoever is best of the Achaeans that woo her in the halls, and offers the most gifts of wooing. But verily, as regards this stranger, now that he has come to thy house, I will clothe him in a cloak and tunic, fair raiment,	ὧδε δέ τις εἴπεσκεν ἰδὼν ἐς πλησίον ἄλλον· αἴθʼ ὤφελλʼ ὁ ξεῖνος ἀλώμενος ἄλλοθʼ ὀλέσθαι πρὶν ἐλθεῖν· τῷ οὔ τι τόσον κέλαδον μετέθηκε. νῦν δὲ περὶ πτωχῶν ἐριδαίνομεν, οὐδέ τι δαιτὸς ἐσθλῆς ἔσσεται ἦδος, ἐπεὶ τὰ χερείονα νικᾷ.
 and will give him a two-edged sword, and sandals for his feet, and send him whithersoever his heart and spirit bid him go. Or, if thou wilt, do thou keep him here at the farmstead, and care for him, and raiment will I send hither and all his food to eat, that he be not the ruin of thee and of thy men.	τοῖσι δὲ καὶ μετέειφʼ ἱερὴ ἲς Τηλεμάχοιο δαιμόνιοι, μαίνεσθε καὶ οὐκέτι κεύθετε θυμῷ βρωτὺν οὐδὲ ποτῆτα· θεῶν νύ τις ὔμμʼ ὀροθύνει. ἀλλʼ εὖ δαισάμενοι κατακείετε οἴκαδʼ ἰόντες, ὁππότε θυμὸς ἄνωγε· διώκω δʼ οὔ τινʼ ἐγώ γε.
But thither will I not suffer him to go, to join the company of the wooers, for they are over-full of wanton insolence, lest they mock him, and dread grief come upon me. And to achieve aught is hard for one man among many, how mighty soever he be, for verily they are far stronger.”	ὣς ἔφαθʼ, οἱ δʼ ἄρα πάντες ὀδὰξ ἐν χείλεσι φύντες Τηλέμαχον θαύμαζον, ὃ θαρσαλέως ἀγόρευε. τοῖσιν δʼ Ἀμφίνομος ἀγορήσατο καὶ μετέειπε Νίσου φαίδιμος υἱός, Ἀρητιάδαο ἄνακτος· ὦ φίλοι, οὐκ ἂν δή τις ἐπὶ ῥηθέντι δικαίῳ
 Then the much-enduring, goodly Odysseus answered him: “Friend, since surely it is right for me to make answer—verily ye rend my heart, as I hear your words, such wantonness you say the wooers devise in the halls in despite of thee, so goodly a man.	ἀντιβίοις ἐπέεσσι καθαπτόμενος χαλεπαίνοι· μήτε τι τὸν ξεῖνον στυφελίζετε μήτε τινʼ ἄλλον δμώων, οἳ κατὰ δώματʼ Ὀδυσσῆος θείοιο. ἀλλʼ ἄγετʼ, οἰνοχόος μὲν ἐπαρξάσθω δεπάεσσιν, ὄφρα σπείσαντες κατακείομεν οἴκαδʼ ἰόντες·
 Tell me, art thou willingly thus oppressed? Or do the people throughout the land hate thee, following the voice of a god? Or hast thou cause to blame thy brothers, in whose fighting a man trusts even if a great strife arise. Would that with my present temper I were as young as thou,	τὸν ξεῖνον δὲ ἐῶμεν ἐνὶ μεγάροις Ὀδυσῆος Τηλεμάχῳ μελέμεν· τοῦ γὰρ φίλον ἵκετο δῶμα. ὣς φάτο, τοῖσι δὲ πᾶσιν ἑαδότα μῦθον ἔειπε. τοῖσιν δὲ κρητῆρα κεράσσατο Μούλιος ἥρως, κῆρυξ Δουλιχιεύς· θεράπων δʼ ἦν Ἀμφινόμοιο·
either the son of blameless Odysseus, or Odysseus himself, straightway then might some stranger cut my head from off my neck, if I did not prove myself the bane of them all when I had come to the halls of Odysseus, son of Laertes.	νώμησεν δʼ ἄρα πᾶσιν ἐπισταδόν· οἱ δὲ θεοῖσι σπείσαντες μακάρεσσι πίον μελιηδέα οἶνον. αὐτὰρ ἐπεὶ σπεῖσάν τʼ ἔπιόν θʼ ὅσον ἤθελε θυμός, βάν ῥʼ ἴμεναι κείοντες ἑὰ πρὸς δώμαθʼ ἕκαστος.
and wine drawn to waste, and men devouring my bread all heedlessly, without limit, with no end to the business.” And wise Telemachus answered him: “Then verily, stranger, I will frankly tell thee all. Neither do the people at large bear me any grudge or hatred,	αὐτὰρ ὁ ἐν μεγάρῳ ὑπελείπετο δῖος Ὀδυσσεύς, μνηστήρεσσι φόνον σὺν Ἀθήνῃ μερμηρίζων· αἶψα δὲ Τηλέμαχον ἔπεα πτερόεντα προσηύδα· Τηλέμαχε, χρὴ τεύχεʼ ἀρήϊα κατθέμεν εἴσω
 nor have I cause to blame brothers, in whose fighting a man trusts, even if a great strife arise. For in this wise has the son of Cronos made our house to run in but a single line. As his only son did Arceisius beget Laertes, as his only son again did his father beget Odysseus, and Odysseus	πάντα μάλʼ· αὐτὰρ μνηστῆρας μαλακοῖς ἐπέεσσι παρφάσθαι, ὅτε κέν σε μεταλλῶσιν ποθέοντες· ἐκ καπνοῦ κατέθηκʼ, ἐπεὶ οὐκέτι τοῖσιν ἐῴκει οἷά ποτε Τροίηνδε κιὼν κατέλειπεν Ὀδυσσεύς, ἀλλὰ κατῄκισται, ὅσσον πυρὸς ἵκετʼ ἀϋτμή.
begot me as his only son, and left me in his halls, and had no joy of me. Therefore it is that foes past counting are now in the house; for all the princes who hold sway over the islands—Dulichium, and Same, and wooded Zacynthus—and those who lord it over rocky Ithaca ,	πρὸς δʼ ἔτι καὶ τόδε μεῖζον ἐνὶ φρεσὶν ἔβαλε δαίμων μή πως οἰνωθέντες, ἔριν στήσαντες ἐν ὑμῖν, ἀλλήλους τρώσητε καταισχύνητέ τε δαῖτα καὶ μνηστύν· αὐτὸς γὰρ ἐφέλκεται ἄνδρα σίδηρος. ὣς φάτο, Τηλέμαχος δὲ φίλῳ ἐπεπείθετο πατρί,
 all these woo my mother and lay waste my house. And she neither refuses the hateful marriage, nor is she able to make an end; but they with feasting consume my substance, and will ere long bring me, too, to ruin. Yet these things verily lie on the knees of the gods.	ἐκ δὲ καλεσσάμενος προσέφη τροφὸν Εὐρύκλειαν· μαῖʼ, ἄγε δή μοι ἔρυξον ἐνὶ μεγάροισι γυναῖκας, ὄφρα κεν ἐς θάλαμον καταθείομαι ἔντεα πατρὸς καλά, τά μοι κατὰ οἶκον ἀκηδέα καπνὸς ἀμέρδει πατρὸς ἀποιχομένοιο· ἐγὼ δʼ ἔτι νήπιος ἦα.
But, father, do thou go with speed, and tell constant Penelope that she has me safe, and I am come from Pylos . But I will abide here, and do thou come back hither, when thou hast told thy tale to her alone; but of the rest of the Achaeans let no one learn it, for many there are who contrive evil against me.”	νῦν δʼ ἐθέλω καταθέσθαι, ἵνʼ οὐ πυρὸς ἵξετʼ ἀϋτμή. τὸν δʼ αὖτε προσέειπε φίλη τροφὸς Εὐρύκλεια· αἲ γὰρ δή ποτε, τέκνον, ἐπιφροσύνας ἀνέλοιο οἴκου κήδεσθαι καὶ κτήματα πάντα φυλάσσειν. ἀλλʼ ἄγε, τίς τοι ἔπειτα μετοιχομένη φάος οἴσει;
 To him then, swineherd Eumaeus, didst thou make answer, and say: “I see, I give heed; this thou biddest one with understanding. But come now, tell me this, and declare it truly; whether I shall go on the self-same way with tidings to Laertes also, wretched man, who for a time, though grieving sorely for Odysseus,	δμῳὰς δʼ οὐκ εἴας προβλωσκέμεν, αἵ κεν ἔφαινον. τὴν δʼ αὖ Τηλέμαχος πεπνυμένος ἀντίον ηὔδα· ξεῖνος ὅδʼ· οὐ γὰρ ἀεργὸν ἀνέξομαι ὅς κεν ἐμῆς γε χοίνικος ἅπτηται, καὶ τηλόθεν εἰληλουθώς. ὣς ἄρʼ ἐφώνησεν, τῇ δʼ ἄπτερος ἔπλετο μῦθος.
was still wont to oversee the fields, and would eat and drink with the slaves in the house, as the heart in his breast bade him. But now, from the day when thou wentest in thy ship to Pylos , they say he has no more eaten and drunk as before, nor overseen the fields, but with groaning and wailing	κλήϊσεν δὲ θύρας μεγάρων εὖ ναιεταόντων. τὼ δʼ ἄρʼ ἀναΐξαντʼ Ὀδυσεὺς καὶ φαίδιμος υἱὸς ἐσφόρεον κόρυθάς τε καὶ ἀσπίδας ὀμφαλοέσσας ἔγχεά τʼ ὀξυόεντα· πάροιθε δὲ Παλλὰς Ἀθήνη, χρύσεον λύχνον ἔχουσα, φάος περικαλλὲς ἐποίει.
he sits and weeps, and the flesh wastes from off his bones.” Then wise Telemachus answered him: “'Tis the sadder; but none the less we will let him be, despite our sorrow; for if in any wise all things might be had by mortals for the wishing, we should choose first of all the day of my father's return.	δὴ τότε Τηλέμαχος προσεφώνεεν ὃν πατέρʼ αἶψα· ὦ πάτερ, ἦ μέγα θαῦμα τόδʼ ὀφθαλμοῖσιν ὁρῶμαι. ἔμπης μοι τοῖχοι μεγάρων καλαί τε μεσόδμαι, εἰλάτιναί τε δοκοί, καὶ κίονες ὑψόσʼ ἔχοντες φαίνοντʼ ὀφθαλμοῖς ὡς εἰ πυρὸς αἰθομένοιο.
No, do thou come back, when thou hast given thy message, and wander not over the fields in search of Laertes; but did my mother with all speed send forth her handmaid, the housewife, secretly, for she might bear word to the old man.” With this he roused the swineherd, and he took his sandals in his hands	ἦ μάλα τις θεὸς ἔνδον, οἳ οὐρανὸν εὐρὺν ἔχουσι. τὸν δʼ ἀπαμειβόμενος προσέφη πολύμητις Ὀδυσσεύς· σίγα καὶ κατὰ σὸν νόον ἴσχανε μηδʼ ἐρέεινε· αὕτη τοι δίκη ἐστὶ θεῶν, οἳ Ὄλυμπον ἔχουσιν. ἀλλὰ σὺ μὲν κατάλεξαι, ἐγὼ δʼ ὑπολείψομαι αὐτοῦ,
 and bound them beneath his feet and went forth to the city. Nor was Athena unaware that the swineherd Eumaeus was gone from the farmstead, but she drew near in the likeness of a woman, comely and tall, and skilled in glorious handiwork. And she stood over against the door of the hut, shewing herself to Odysseus,	ὄφρα κʼ ἔτι δμῳὰς καὶ μητέρα σὴν ἐρεθίζω· ἡ δέ μʼ ὀδυρομένη εἰρήσεται ἀμφὶς ἕκαστα. ὣς φάτο, Τηλέμαχος δὲ διὲκ μεγάροιο βεβήκει κείων ἐς θάλαμον, δαΐδων ὕπο λαμπομενάων, ἔνθα πάρος κοιμᾶθʼ, ὅτε μιν γλυκὺς ὕπνος ἱκάνοι·
 but Telemachus did not see her before him, or notice her; for in no wise do the gods appear in manifest presence to all. But Odysseus saw her, and the hounds, and they barked not, but with whining slunk in fear to the further side of the farmstead. The she made a sign with her brows, and goodly Odysseus perceived it,	ἔνθʼ ἄρα καὶ τότʼ ἔλεκτο καὶ Ἠῶ δῖαν ἔμιμνεν. αὐτὰρ ὁ ἐν μεγάρῳ ὑπελείπετο δῖος Ὀδυσσεύς, μνηστήρεσσι φόνον σὺν Ἀθήνῃ μερμηρίζων. ἡ δʼ ἴεν ἐκ θαλάμοιο περίφρων Πηνελόπεια, Ἀρτέμιδι ἰκέλη ἠὲ χρυσέῃ Ἀφροδίτῃ.
and went forth from the hall, past the great wall of the court, and stood before her, and Athena spoke to him, saying: “Son of Laertes, sprung from Zeus, Odysseus of many devices, even now do thou reveal thy word to thy son, and hide it not, that when you two have planned death and fate for the wooers,	τῇ παρὰ μὲν κλισίην πυρὶ κάτθεσαν, ἔνθʼ ἄρʼ ἐφῖζε, δινωτὴν ἐλέφαντι καὶ ἀργύρῳ· ἥν ποτε τέκτων ποίησʼ Ἰκμάλιος, καὶ ὑπὸ θρῆνυν ποσὶν ἧκε προσφυέʼ ἐξ αὐτῆς, ὅθʼ ἐπὶ μέγα βάλλετο κῶας. ἔνθα καθέζετʼ ἔπειτα περίφρων Πηνελόπεια.
you may go to the famous city. Nor will I myself be long away from you, for I am eager for the battle.” With this, Athena touched him with her golden wand. A well-washed cloak and a tunic she first of all cast about his breast, and she increased his stature and his youthful bloom.	ἦλθον δὲ δμῳαὶ λευκώλενοι ἐκ μεγάροιο. αἱ δʼ ἀπὸ μὲν σῖτον πολὺν ᾕρεον ἠδὲ τραπέζας καὶ δέπα, ἔνθεν ἄρʼ ἄνδρες ὑπερμενέοντες ἔπινον· πῦρ δʼ ἀπὸ λαμπτήρων χαμάδις βάλον, ἄλλα δʼ ἐπʼ αὐτῶν νήησαν ξύλα πολλά, φόως ἔμεν ἠδὲ θέρεσθαι.
 Once more he grew dark of color, and his cheeks filled out, and dark grew the beard about his chin. Then, when she had wrought thus, she departed, but Odysseus went into the hut. And his dear son marvelled, and, seized with fear, turned his eyes aside, lest it should be a god.	ἡ δʼ Ὀδυσῆʼ ἐνένιπε Μελανθὼ δεύτερον αὖτις· ξεῖνʼ, ἔτι καὶ νῦν ἐνθάδʼ ἀνιήσεις διὰ νύκτα δινεύων κατὰ οἶκον, ὀπιπεύσεις δὲ γυναῖκας; ἀλλʼ ἔξελθε θύραζε, τάλαν, καὶ δαιτὸς ὄνησο· ἢ τάχα καὶ δαλῷ βεβλημένος εἶσθα θύραζε.
And he spoke, and addressed him with winged words: “Of other sort thou seemest to me now, stranger, than awhile ago, and other are the garments thou hast on, and thy color is no more the same. Verily thou art a god, one of those who hold broad heaven. Nay then, be gracious, that we may offer to thee acceptable sacrifices	τὴν δʼ ἄρʼ ὑπόδρα ἰδὼν προσέφη πολύμητις Ὀδυσσεύς· δαιμονίη, τί μοι ὧδʼ ἐπέχεις κεκοτηότι θυμῷ; ἦ ὅτι δὴ ῥυπόω, κακὰ δὲ χροῒ εἵματα εἷμαι, πτωχεύω δʼ ἀνὰ δῆμον; ἀναγκαίη γὰρ ἐπείγει. τοιοῦτοι πτωχοὶ καὶ ἀλήμονες ἄνδρες ἔασι
and golden gifts, finely wrought; but do thou spare us.” Then the much-enduring, goodly Odysseus answered him: “Be sure I am no god; why dost thou liken me to the immortals? Nay, I am thy father, for whose sake thou dost with groaning endure many griefs, and submittest to the violence of men.”	καὶ γὰρ ἐγώ ποτε οἶκον ἐν ἀνθρώποισιν ἔναιον ὄλβιος ἀφνειὸν καὶ πολλάκι δόσκον ἀλήτῃ, τοίῳ ὁποῖος ἔοι καὶ ὅτευ κεχρημένος ἔλθοι· ἦσαν δὲ δμῶες μάλα μυρίοι, ἄλλα τε πολλὰ οἷσίν τʼ εὖ ζώουσι καὶ ἀφνειοὶ καλέονται.
So saying, he kissed his son, and from his cheeks let fall a tear to earth, but before he ever steadfastly held them back. Howbeit Telemachus—for he did not yet believe that it was his father—again answered, and spoke to him, saying: “Thou verily art not my father Odysseus, but some god	ἀλλὰ Ζεὺς ἀλάπαξε Κρονίων· ἤθελε γάρ που· τῷ νῦν μήποτε καὶ σύ, γύναι, ἀπὸ πᾶσαν ὀλέσσῃς ἀγλαΐην, τῇ νῦν γε μετὰ δμῳῇσι κέκασσαι· μή πώς τοι δέσποινα κοτεσσαμένη χαλεπήνῃ, ἢ Ὀδυσεὺς ἔλθῃ· ἔτι γὰρ καὶ ἐλπίδος αἶσα.
 beguiles me, that I may weep and groan yet more. For nowise could a mortal man contrive this by his own wit, unless a god were himself to come to him, and easily by his will make him young or old. For verily but now thou wast an old man and meanly clad,	εἰ δʼ ὁ μὲν ὣς ἀπόλωλε καὶ οὐκέτι νόστιμός ἐστιν, ἀλλʼ ἤδη παῖς τοῖος Ἀπόλλωνός γε ἕκητι, Τηλέμαχος· τὸν δʼ οὔ τις ἐνὶ μεγάροισι γυναικῶν λήθει ἀτασθάλλουσʼ, ἐπεὶ οὐκέτι τηλίκος ἐστίν. ὣς φάτο, τοῦ δʼ ἤκουσε περίφρων Πηνελόπεια,
whereas now thou art like the gods, who hold broad heaven.” Then Odysseus of many wiles answered him, and said: “Telemachus, it beseems thee not to wonder overmuch that thy father is in the house, or to be amazed. For thou mayest be sure no other Odysseus will ever come hither;	ἀμφίπολον δʼ ἐνένιπεν ἔπος τʼ ἔφατʼ ἔκ τʼ ὀνόμαζε· πάντως, θαρσαλέη, κύον ἀδεές, οὔ τί με λήθεις ἔρδουσα μέγα ἔργον, ὃ σῇ κεφαλῇ ἀναμάξεις· πάντα γὰρ εὖ ᾔδησθʼ, ἐπεὶ ἐξ ἐμεῦ ἔκλυες αὐτῆς ὡς τὸν ξεῖνον ἔμελλον ἐνὶ μεγάροισιν ἐμοῖσιν
 but I here, I, even such as thou seest me, after sufferings and many wanderings, am come in the twentieth year to my native land. But this, thou must know, is the work of Athena, driver of the spoil, who makes me such as she will—for she has the power—now like a beggar, and now again	ἀμφὶ πόσει εἴρεσθαι, ἐπεὶ πυκινῶς ἀκάχημαι. ἦ ῥα καὶ Εὐρυνόμην ταμίην πρὸς μῦθον ἔειπεν· Εὐρυνόμη, φέρε δὴ δίφρον καὶ κῶας ἐπʼ αὐτοῦ, ὄφρα καθεζόμενος εἴπῃ ἔπος ἠδʼ ἐπακούσῃ ὁ ξεῖνος ἐμέθεν· ἐθέλω δέ μιν ἐξερέεσθαι.
like a young man, and one wearing fair raiment about his body. Easy it is for the gods, who hold broad heaven, both to glorify a mortal man and to abase him.” So saying, he sat down, and Telemachus, flinging his arms about his noble father, wept and shed tears,	ὣς ἔφαθʼ, ἡ δὲ μάλʼ ὀτραλέως κατέθηκε φέρουσα δίφρον ἐΰξεστον καὶ ἐπʼ αὐτῷ κῶας ἔβαλλεν· ἔνθα καθέζετʼ ἔπειτα πολύτλας δῖος Ὀδυσσεύς. τοῖσι δὲ μύθων ἦρχε περίφρων Πηνελόπεια· ξεῖνε, τὸ μέν σε πρῶτον ἐγὼν εἰρήσομαι αὐτή·
 and in the hearts of both arose a longing for lamentation. And they wailed aloud more vehemently than birds, sea-eagles, or vultures with crooked talons, whose young the country-folk have taken from their nest before they were fledged; even so piteously did they let tears fall from beneath their brows.	τίς πόθεν εἶς ἀνδρῶν; πόθι τοι πόλις ἠδὲ τοκῆες; τὴν δʼ ἀπαμειβόμενος προσέφη πολύμητις Ὀδυσσεύς· ὦ γύναι, οὐκ ἄν τίς σε βροτῶν ἐπʼ ἀπείρονα γαῖαν νεικέοι· ἦ γάρ σευ κλέος οὐρανὸν εὐρὺν ἱκάνει, ὥς τέ τευ ἢ βασιλῆος ἀμύμονος, ὅς τε θεουδὴς
And now would the light of the sun have gone down upon their weeping, had not Telemachus spoken to his father suddenly: “In what manner of ship, dear father, have sailors now brought thee hither to Ithaca ? Who did they declare themselves to be? For nowise, methinks, didst thou come hither on foot.”	ἀνδράσιν ἐν πολλοῖσι καὶ ἰφθίμοισιν ἀνάσσων εὐδικίας ἀνέχῃσι, φέρῃσι δὲ γαῖα μέλαινα πυροὺς καὶ κριθάς, βρίθῃσι δὲ δένδρεα καρπῷ, τίκτῃ δʼ ἔμπεδα μῆλα, θάλασσα δὲ παρέχῃ ἰχθῦς ἐξ εὐηγεσίης, ἀρετῶσι δὲ λαοὶ ὑπʼ αὐτοῦ.
 And the much-enduring, goodly Odysseus answered him: “Then verily, my child, I will tell thee all the truth. The Phaeacians brought me, men famed for their ships, who send other men too on their way, whosoever comes to them. And they brought me as I slept in a swift ship over the sea,	τῷ ἐμὲ νῦν τὰ μὲν ἄλλα μετάλλα σῷ ἐνὶ οἴκῳ, μηδʼ ἐμὸν ἐξερέεινε γένος καὶ πατρίδα γαῖαν, μή μοι μᾶλλον θυμὸν ἐνιπλήσῃς ὀδυνάων μνησαμένῳ μάλα δʼ εἰμὶ πολύστονος· οὐδέ τί με χρὴ οἴκῳ ἐν ἀλλοτρίῳ γοόωντά τε μυρόμενόν τε
and set me down in Ithaca , and gave me glorious gifts, stores of bronze and gold and woven raiment. These treasures, by the favour of the gods, are lying in caves. And now I am come hither at the bidding of Athena, that we may take counsel about the slaying of our foes.	ἧσθαι, ἐπεὶ κάκιον πενθήμεναι ἄκριτον αἰεί· μή τίς μοι δμῳῶν νεμεσήσεται, ἠὲ σύ γʼ αὐτή, φῇ δὲ δακρυπλώειν βεβαρηότα με φρένας οἴνῳ. τὸν δʼ ἠμείβετʼ ἔπειτα περίφρων Πηνελόπεια· ξεῖνʼ, ἦ τοι μὲν ἐμὴν ἀρετὴν εἶδός τε δέμας τε
Come now, count me the wooers, and tell their tale, that I may know how many they are and what manner of men, and that I may ponder in my noble heart and decide whether we two shall be able to maintain our cause against them alone without others, or whether we shall also seek out others.”	ὤλεσαν ἀθάνατοι, ὅτε Ἴλιον εἰσανέβαινον Ἀργεῖοι, μετὰ τοῖσι δʼ ἐμὸς πόσις ᾖεν Ὀδυσσεύς εἰ κεῖνός γʼ ἐλθὼν τὸν ἐμὸν βίον ἀμφιπολεύοι, μεῖζον κε κλέος εἴη ἐμὸν καὶ κάλλιον οὕτως. νῦν δʼ ἄχομαι· τόσα γάρ μοι ἐπέσσευεν κακὰ δαίμων.
 Then wise Telemachus answered him: “Father, of a truth I have ever heard of thy great fame, that thou wast a warrior in strength of hand and in wise counsel, but this thou sayest is too great; amazement holds me. It could not be that two men should fight against many men and mighty.	ὅσσοι γὰρ νήσοισιν ἐπικρατέουσιν ἄριστοι, Δουλιχίῳ τε Σάμῃ τε καὶ ὑλήεντι Ζακύνθῳ, οἵ τʼ αὐτὴν Ἰθάκην εὐδείελον ἀμφινέμονται, οἵ μʼ ἀεκαζομένην μνῶνται, τρύχουσι δὲ οἶκον. τῷ οὔτε ξείνων ἐμπάξομαι οὔθʼ ἱκετάων
 For of the wooers there are not ten alone, or twice ten, but full many more. Here as we are shalt thou straightway learn their number. From Dulichium there are two and fifty chosen youths, and six serving men attend them; from Same came four and twenty men;	οὔτε τι κηρύκων, οἳ δημιοεργοὶ ἔασιν· ἀλλʼ Ὀδυσῆ ποθέουσα φίλον κατατήκομαι ἦτορ. οἱ δὲ γάμον σπεύδουσιν· ἐγὼ δὲ δόλους τολυπεύω. φᾶρος μέν μοι πρῶτον ἐνέπνευσε φρεσὶ δαίμων, στησαμένῃ μέγαν ἱστόν, ἐνὶ μεγάροισιν ὑφαίνειν,
from Zacynthus there are twenty youths of the Achaeans; and from Ithaca itself twelve men, all of them the noblest, and with them is Medon, the herald, and the divine minstrel, and two squires skilled in carving meats. If we shall meet all these within the halls,	λεπτὸν καὶ περίμετρον· ἄφαρ δʼ αὐτοῖς μετέειπον· κοῦροι, ἐμοὶ μνηστῆρες, ἐπεὶ θάνε δῖος Ὀδυσσεύς, μίμνετʼ ἐπειγόμενοι τὸν ἐμὸν γάμον, εἰς ὅ κε φᾶρος ἐκτελέσω—μή μοι μεταμώνια νήματʼ ὄληται— Λαέρτῃ ἥρωϊ ταφήϊον, εἰς ὅτε κέν μιν
bitter, I fear, and with bane will be thy coming to avenge violence. Nay, do thou consider, if thou canst bethink thee of any helper—one that would aid us two with a ready heart.” Then the much-enduring, goodly Odysseus answered him:“Well, then, I will tell thee, and do thou give heed and hearken to my words,	μοῖρʼ ὀλοὴ καθέλῃσι τανηλεγέος θανάτοιο· μή τίς μοι κατὰ δῆμον Ἀχαιϊάδων νεμεσήσῃ, αἴ κεν ἄτερ σπείρου κεῖται πολλὰ κτεατίσσας. ὣς ἐφάμην, τοῖσιν δʼ ἐπεπείθετο θυμὸς ἀγήνωρ. ἔνθα καὶ ἠματίη μὲν ὑφαίνεσκον μέγαν ἱστόν,
and consider whether for us two Athena, with father Zeus, will be enough, or whether I shall bethink me of some other helper.” Then wise Telemachus answered him: “Good, thou mayest be sure, are these two helpers whom thou dost mention, though high in the clouds do they abide, and they	νύκτας δʼ ἀλλύεσκον, ἐπεὶ δαΐδας παραθείμην. ὣς τρίετες μὲν ἔληθον ἐγὼ καὶ ἔπειθον Ἀχαιούς· ἀλλʼ ὅτε τέτρατον ἦλθεν ἔτος καὶ ἐπήλυθον ὧραι, μηνῶν φθινόντων, περὶ δʼ ἤματα πόλλʼ ἐτελέσθη, καὶ τότε δή με διὰ δμῳάς, κύνας οὐκ ἀλεγούσας,
rule over all men alike and the immortal gods.” Then the much-enduring, goodly Odysseus answered: “Not long of a surety will those two hold aloof from the mighty fray, when between the wooers and us in my halls the might of Ares is put to the test.	εἷλον ἐπελθόντες καὶ ὁμόκλησαν ἐπέεσσιν. ὣς τὸ μὲν ἐξετέλεσσα, καὶ οὐκ ἐθέλουσʼ, ὑπʼ ἀνάγκης· νῦν δʼ οὔτʼ ἐκφυγέειν δύναμαι γάμον οὔτε τινʼ ἄλλην μῆτιν ἔθʼ εὑρίσκω· μάλα δʼ ὀτρύνουσι τοκῆες γήμασθʼ, ἀσχαλάᾳ δὲ πάϊς βίοτον κατεδόντων,
 But for the present, do thou go at daybreak to thy house and join the company of the haughty wooers. As for me, the swineherd will lead me later on to the city in the likeness of a woeful and aged beggar. And if they shall put despite on me in the house,	γιγνώσκων· ἤδη γὰρ ἀνὴρ οἶός τε μάλιστα οἴκου κήδεσθαι, τῷ τε Ζεὺς κῦδος ὀπάζει. ἀλλὰ καὶ ὥς μοι εἰπὲ τεὸν γένος, ὁππόθεν ἐσσί. οὐ γὰρ ἀπὸ δρυός ἐσσι παλαιφάτου οὐδʼ ἀπὸ πέτρης. τὴν δʼ ἀπαμειβόμενος προσέφη πολύμητις Ὀδυσσεύς·
let the heart in thy breast endure while I am evil entreated, even if they drag me by the feet through the house to the door, or hurl at me and smite me; still do thou endure to behold it. Thou shalt indeed bid them cease their folly, seeking to dissuade them with gentle words; yet in no wise will they hearken to thee, for verily their day of doom is at hand. And another thing will I tell thee, and do thou lay it to heart. When Athena, rich in counsel, shall put it in my mind, I will nod to thee with my head; and do thou thereupon, when thou notest it, take all the weapons of war that lie in thy halls, and lay them away one and all in the secret place of the lofty store-room. And as for the wooers, when they miss the arms and question thee, do thou beguile them with gentle words, saying: “‘Out of the smoke have I laid them, since they are no longer like those which of old Odysseus left behind him when he went forth to Troy , but are all befouled so far as the breath of the fire has reached them. And furthermore this greater fear has the son of Cronos put in my heart, lest haply, when heated with wine, you may set a quarrel afoot among you and wound one another, and so bring shame on your feast and on your wooing. For of itself does the iron draw a man to it.’ “But for us two alone do thou leave behind two swords and two spears, and two ox-hide shields for us to grasp, that we may rush upon them and seize them; while as for the wooers, Pallas Athena and Zeus, the counsellor, will beguile them. And another thing will I tell thee, and do thou lay it to heart. If in truth thou art my son and of our blood, then let no one hear that Odysseus is at home; neither let Laertes know it, nor the swineherd, nor any of the household, nor Penelope herself; but by ourselves thou and I will learn the temper of the women. Aye, and we will likewise make trial of many a one of the serving men, and see where any of them honours us two and fears us at heart, and who recks not of us and scorns thee, a man so goodly.” Then his glorious son answered him, and said: “Father, my spirit, methinks, thou shalt verily come to know hereafter, for no slackness of will possesses me. But I think not that this plan will be a gain to us both, and so I bid thee take thought. Long time shalt thou vainly go about, making trial of each man as thou visitest the farms, while in thy halls those others at their ease are wasting thy substance in insolent wise, and there is no sparing. Yet verily, as for the women, I do bid thee learn who among them dishonor thee, and who are guiltless. But of the men in the farmsteads I would not that we should make trial, but that we should deal therewith hereafter, if in very truth thou knowest some sign from Zeus who bears the aegis.” Thus they spoke to one another, but meanwhile into Ithaca put the well-built ship that brought Telemachus and all his comrades from Pylos ; and they, when they had come into the deep harbor, drew the black ship up on the shore, while proud squires bore forth their armour and straightway carried the beauteous gifts to the house of Clytius. But they sent a herald forth to the house of Odysseus to bear word to wise Penelope that Telemachus was at the farm, and had bidden the ship to sail on to the city, lest the noble queen might grow anxious and let round tears fall. So the two met, the herald and the goodly swineherd, on the self-same errand, to bear tidings to the lady. And when they reached the palace of the godlike king, the herald spoke out in the midst of the handmaids, and said: “Even now, queen, thy son has come back from Pylos .” But the swineherd came close to Penelope and told her all that her dear son had bidden him say. And when he had fully told all that had been commanded him, he went his way to the swine and left the courtyard and the hall. But the wooers were dismayed and downcast in spirit, and forth they went from the hall past the great wall of the court, and there before the gates they sat down. Then among them Eurymachus, son of Polybus, was the first to speak: “My friends, verily a great deed has been insolently brought to pass by Telemachus, even this journey, and we deemed that he would never see it accomplished. But come, let us launch a black ship, the best we have, and let us get together seamen as rowers that they may straightway bear tidings to those others speedily to return home.” Not yet was the word fully uttered when Amphinomus, turning in his place, saw a ship in the deep harbor and men furling the sail, and with oars in their hands. Then, breaking into a merry laugh, he spoke among his comrades: “Let us not be sending a message any more, for here they are at home. Either some god told them of this, or they themselves caught sight of the ship of Telemachus as she sailed by, but could not catch her.” So he spoke, and they rose up and went to the shore of the sea. Swiftly the men drew up the black ship on the shore, and proud squires bore forth their armour. Themselves meanwhile went all together to the place of assembly, and none other would they suffer to sit with them, either of the young men or the old. Then among them spoke Antinous, son of Eupeithes: “Lo, now, see how the gods have delivered this man from destruction. Day by day watchmen sat upon the windy heights, watch ever following watch, and at set of sun we never spent a night upon the shore, but sailing over the deep in our swift ship we waited for the bright Dawn, lying in wait for Telemachus, that we might take him and slay the man himself; howbeit meanwhile some god has brought him home. But, on our part, let us here devise for him a woeful death, even for Telemachus, and let him not escape from out our hands, for I deem that while he lives this work of ours will not prosper. For he is himself shrewd in counsel and in wisdom, and the people nowise show us favour any more. Nay, come, before he gathers the Achaeans to the place of assembly—for methinks he will in no wise be slow to act, but will be full of wrath, and rising up will declare among them all how that we contrived against him utter destruction, but did not catch him; and they will not praise us when they hear of our evil deeds. Beware, then, lest they work us some harm and drive us out from our country, and we come to the land of strangers. Nay, let us act first, and seize him in the field far from the city, or on the road; and his substance let us ourselves keep, and his wealth, dividing them fairly among us; though the house we would give to his mother to possess, and to him who weds her. Howbeit if this plan does not please you, but you choose rather that he should live and keep all the wealth of his fathers, let us not continue to devour his store of pleasant things as we gather together here, but let each man from his own hall woo her with his gifts and seek to win her; and she then would wed him who offers most, and who comes as her fated lord.” So he spoke, and they were all hushed in silence. Then Amphinomus addressed their assembly, and spoke among them. He was the glorious son of the prince Nisus, son of Aretias, and he led the wooers who came from Dulichium, rich in wheat and in grass, and above all the others he pleased Penelope with his words, for he had an understanding heart. He it was who with good intent addressed their assembly, and spoke among them: “Friends, I surely would not choose to kill Telemachus; a dread thing is it to slay one of royal stock. Nay, let us first seek to learn the will of the gods. If the oracles of great Zeus approve, I will myself slay him, and bid all the others do so; but if the gods turn us from the act, I bid you desist.” Thus spoke Amphinomus, and his word was pleasing to them. So they arose straightway and went to the house of Odysseus, and entering in, sat down on the polished seats. Then the wise Penelope took other counsel, to show herself to the wooers, overweening in their insolence. For she had learned of the threatened death of her son in her halls, for the herald Medon told her, who had heard their counsel. So she went her way toward the hall with her handmaids. But when the fair lady reached the wooers, she stood by the doorpost of the well-built hall, holding before her face her shining veil; and she rebuked Antinous, and spoke, and addressed him: “Antinous, full of insolence, deviser of evil! and yet it is thou, men say, that dost excel among all of thy years in the land of Ithaca in counsel and in speech. But thou, it seems, art not such a man. Madman! why dost thou devise death and fate for Telemachus, and carest not for suppliants, for whom Zeus is witness. 'Tis an impious thing to plot evil one against another. Dost thou not know of the time when thy father came to this house a fugitive in terror of the people? For of a truth they were greatly wroth with him because he had joined Taphian pirates and harried the Thesprotians, who were in league with us. Him, then, they were minded to slay, and take from him his life by violence, and utterly to devour his great and pleasant livelihood; but Odysseus held them back, and stayed them despite their eagerness. His house it is that thou consumest now without atonement, and wooest his wife, and seekest to slay his son, and on me thou bringest great distress. Nay, forbear, I charge thee, and bid the rest forbear.” Then Eurymachus, son of Polybus, answered her: “Daughter of Icarius, wise Penelope, be of good cheer, and let not things distress thy heart. That man lives not, nor shall live, nor shall ever be born, who shall lay hands upon thy son Telemachus while I live and behold the light upon the earth. For thus will I speak out to thee, and verily it shall be brought to pass. Quickly shall that man's black blood flow forth about my spear; for of a truth me, too, did Odysseus the sacker of cities often set upon his knees, and put roast meat in my hands, and hold to my lips red wine. Therefore Telemachus is far the dearest of all men to me, and I bid him have no fear of death, at least from the wooers; but from the gods can no man avoid it.” Thus he spoke to cheer her, but against that son he was himself plotting death. So she went up to her bright upper chamber and then bewailed Odysseus, her dear husband, until flashing-eyed Athena cast sweet sleep upon her eyelids. But at evening the goodly swineherd came back to Odysseus and his son, and they were busily making ready their supper, and had slain a boar of a year old. Then Athena came close to Odysseus, son of Laertes, and smote him with her wand, and again made him an old man; and mean raiment she put about his body, lest the swineherd might look upon him and know him, and might go to bear tidings to constant Penelope, and not hold the secret fast in his heart. Now Telemachus spoke first to the swineherd, and said: “Thou hast come, goodly Eumaeus. What news is there in the city? Have the proud wooers by this time come home from their ambush, or are they still watching for me where they were, to take me on my homeward way?” To him, then, swineherd Eumaeus, didst thou make answer and say: “I was not minded to go about the city, asking and enquiring of this; my heart bade me with all speed to come back hither when I had given my message. But there joined me a swift messenger from thy companions, a herald, who was the first to tell the news to thy mother. And this further thing I know, for I saw it with my eyes. I was now above the city, as I went on my way, where the hill of Hermes is, when I saw a swift ship putting into our harbor, and there were many men in her, and she was laden with shields and double-pointed spears. And I thought it was they, but I have no knowledge.” So he spoke, and the strong and mighty Telemachus smiled and with his eyes he glanced at his father, but shunned the swineherd's eye. And when they had ceased from their labour and had made ready the meal, they fell to feasting, nor did their hearts lack aught of the equal feast. But when they had put from them the desire of food and drink, they bethought them of rest, and took the gift of sleep.	ὦ γύναι αἰδοίη Λαερτιάδεω Ὀδυσῆος, οὐκέτʼ ἀπολλήξεις τὸν ἐμὸν γόνον ἐξερέουσα; ἀλλʼ ἔκ τοι ἐρέω· ἦ μέν μʼ ἀχέεσσί γε δώσεις πλείοσιν ἢ ἔχομαι· ἡ γὰρ δίκη, ὁππότε πάτρης ἧς ἀπέῃσιν ἀνὴρ τόσσον χρόνον ὅσσον ἐγὼ νῦν,
 As soon as early Dawn appeared, the rosy-fingered, Telemachus, the dear son of divine Odysseus, bound beneath his feet his fair sandals and took his mighty spear, that fitted his grasp,	ἄλλη δʼ ἄλλων γλῶσσα μεμιγμένη· ἐν μὲν Ἀχαιοί, ἐν δʼ Ἐτεόκρητες μεγαλήτορες, ἐν δὲ Κύδωνες, Δωριέες τε τριχάϊκες δῖοί τε Πελασγοί. τῇσι δʼ ἐνὶ Κνωσός, μεγάλη πόλις, ἔνθα τε Μίνως ἐννέωρος βασίλευε Διὸς μεγάλου ὀαριστής,
hasting to the city; and he spoke to his swineherd, saying: “Father, I verily am going to the city, that my mother may see me, for, methinks, she will not cease from woeful wailing and tearful lamentation until she sees my very self. But to thee I give this charge.	πατρὸς ἐμοῖο πατήρ, μεγαθύμου Δευκαλίωνος Δευκαλίων δʼ ἐμὲ τίκτε καὶ Ἰδομενῆα ἄνακτα· ἀλλʼ ὁ μὲν ἐν νήεσσι κορωνίσιν Ἴλιον ἴσω ᾤχεθʼ ἅμʼ Ἀτρείδῃσιν, ἐμοὶ δʼ ὄνομα κλυτὸν Αἴθων, ὁπλότερος γενεῇ· ὁ δʼ ἄρα πρότερος καὶ ἀρείων.
 Lead this wretched stranger to the city, that there he may beg his food, and whoso will shall give him a loaf and a cup of water. For my part, I can in no wise burden myself with all men, seeing that I have grief at heart. But if the stranger is sore angered at this,	ἔνθʼ Ὀδυσῆα ἐγὼν ἰδόμην καὶ ξείνια δῶκα. καὶ γὰρ τὸν Κρήτηνδε κατήγαγεν ἲς ἀνέμοιο, ἱέμενον Τροίηνδε παραπλάγξασα Μαλειῶν· στῆσε δʼ ἐν Ἀμνισῷ, ὅθι τε σπέος Εἰλειθυίης, ἐν λιμέσιν χαλεποῖσι, μόγις δʼ ὑπάλυξεν ἀέλλας.
 For I am no more of an age to remain at the farmstead, so as to obey in all things the command of an overseer. Nay, go thy way; this man that thou biddest will lead me as soon as I have warmed myself at the fire, and the sun has grown hot. For miserably poor are these garments which I wear, and I fear lest	αὐτίκα δʼ Ἰδομενῆα μετάλλα ἄστυδʼ ἀνελθών· ξεῖνον γάρ οἱ ἔφασκε φίλον τʼ ἔμεν αἰδοῖόν τε. τῷ δʼ ἤδη δεκάτη ἢ ἑνδεκάτη πέλεν ἠὼς οἰχομένῳ σὺν νηυσὶ κορωνίσιν Ἴλιον εἴσω. τὸν μὲν ἐγὼ πρὸς δώματʼ ἄγων ἐῢ ἐξείνισσα,
the morning frost may overcome me; and ye say it is far to the city.” So he spoke, and Telemachus passed out through the farmstead with rapid strides, and was sowing the seeds of evil for the wooers. But when he came to the stately house he set his spear in place, leaning it against a tall pillar,	ἐνδυκέως φιλέων, πολλῶν κατὰ οἶκον ἐόντων· καί οἱ τοῖς ἄλλοις ἑτάροις, οἳ ἅμʼ αὐτῷ ἕποντο, δημόθεν ἄλφιτα δῶκα καὶ αἴθοπα οἶνον ἀγείρας καὶ βοῦς ἱρεύσασθαι, ἵνα πλησαίατο θυμόν. ἔνθα δυώδεκα μὲν μένον ἤματα δῖοι Ἀχαιοί·
and himself went in and crossed the threshold of stone. Him the nurse Eurycleia was far the first to see, as she was spreading fleeces on the richly-wrought chairs. With a burst of tears she came straight toward him, and round about them gathered the other maids of Odysseus of the steadfast heart,	εἴλει γὰρ Βορέης ἄνεμος μέγας οὐδʼ ἐπὶ γαίῃ εἴα ἵστασθαι, χαλεπὸς δέ τις ὤρορε δαίμων. τῇ τρισκαιδεκάτῃ δʼ ἄνεμος πέσε, τοὶ δʼ ἀνάγοντο. ἴσκε ψεύδεα πολλὰ λέγων ἐτύμοισιν ὁμοῖα· τῆς δʼ ἄρʼ ἀκουούσης ῥέε δάκρυα, τήκετο δὲ χρώς·
and they kissed his head and shoulders in loving welcome. Then forth from her chamber came wise Penelope, like unto Artemis or golden Aphrodite, and bursting into tears she flung her arms about her dear son, and kissed his head and both his beautiful eyes;	ὡς δὲ χιὼν κατατήκετʼ ἐν ἀκροπόλοισιν ὄρεσσιν, ἥν τʼ Εὖρος κατέτηξεν, ἐπὴν Ζέφυρος καταχεύῃ· τηκομένης δʼ ἄρα τῆς ποταμοὶ πλήθουσι ῥέοντες· ὣς τῆς τήκετο καλὰ παρήϊα δάκρυ χεούσης, κλαιούσης ἑὸν ἄνδρα παρήμενον. αὐτὰρ Ὀδυσσεὺς
and with wailing she spoke to him winged words: “Thou art come, Telemachus, sweet light of my eyes; I thought I should never see thee more after thou hadst gone in thy ship to Pylos —secretly, and in my despite, to seek tidings of thy dear father. Come, then, tell me what sight thou hadst of him.”	θυμῷ μὲν γοόωσαν ἑὴν ἐλέαιρε γυναῖκα, ὀφθαλμοὶ δʼ ὡς εἰ κέρα ἕστασαν ἠὲ σίδηρος ἀτρέμας ἐν βλεφάροισι· δόλῳ δʼ ὅ γε δάκρυα κεῦθεν. ἡ δʼ ἐπεὶ οὖν τάρφθη πολυδακρύτοιο γόοιο, ἐξαῦτίς μιν ἔπεσσιν ἀμειβομένη προσέειπε·
 Then wise Telemachus answered her:“My mother, stir not lamentation, I pray thee, nor rouse the heart in my breast, seeing that I am escaped from utter destruction. Nay, bathe thyself, and take clean raiment for thy body, and then, going to thy upper chamber with thy handmaids,	νῦν μὲν δή σευ, ξεῖνέ γʼ, ὀΐω πειρήσεσθαι, εἰ ἐτεὸν δὴ κεῖθι σὺν ἀντιθέοις ἑτάροισι ξείνισας ἐν μεγάροισιν ἐμὸν πόσιν, ὡς ἀγορεύεις. εἰπέ μοι ὁπποῖʼ ἄσσα περὶ χροῒ εἵματα ἕστο, αὐτός θʼ οἷος ἔην, καὶ ἑταίρους, οἵ οἱ ἕποντο.
 vow to all the gods that thou wilt offer hecatombs that bring fulfillment, in the hope that Zeus may some day bring deeds of requital to pass. But I will go to the place of assembly that I may bid to our house a stranger who followed me from Pylos on my way hither. Him I sent forward with my godlike comrades,	τὴν δʼ ἀπαμειβόμενος προσέφη πολύμητις Ὀδυσσεύς· ὦ γύναι, ἀργαλέον τόσσον χρόνον ἀμφὶς ἐόντα εἰπέμεν· ἤδη γάρ οἱ ἐεικοστὸν ἔτος ἐστὶν ἐξ οὗ κεῖθεν ἔβη καὶ ἐμῆς ἀπελήλυθε πάτρης· αὐτάρ τοι ἐρέω ὥς μοι ἰνδάλλεται ἦτορ.
and I bade Peiraeus take him home and give him kindly welcome, and show him honor until I should come.” So he spoke, but her word remained unwinged. Then she bathed and took clean raiment for her body, and vowed to all the gods that she would offer hecatombs	χλαῖναν πορφυρέην οὔλην ἔχε δῖος Ὀδυσσεύς, διπλῆν· αὐτάρ οἱ περόνη χρυσοῖο τέτυκτο αὐλοῖσιν διδύμοισι· πάροιθε δὲ δαίδαλον ἦεν· ἐν προτέροισι πόδεσσι κύων ἔχε ποικίλον ἐλλόν, ἀσπαίροντα λάων· τὸ δὲ θαυμάζεσκον ἅπαντες,
that bring fulfillment, in the hope that Zeus would some day bring deeds of requital to pass. But Telemachus thereafter went forth through the hall with his spear in his hand, and with him went two swift hounds. And wondrous was the grace that Athena shed upon him, and all the people marvelled at him as he came.	ὡς οἱ χρύσεοι ἐόντες ὁ μὲν λάε νεβρὸν ἀπάγχων, αὐτὰρ ὁ ἐκφυγέειν μεμαὼς ἤσπαιρε πόδεσσι. τὸν δὲ χιτῶνʼ ἐνόησα περὶ χροῒ σιγαλόεντα, οἷόν τε κρομύοιο λοπὸν κάτα ἰσχαλέοιο· τὼς μὲν ἔην μαλακός, λαμπρὸς δʼ ἦν ἠέλιος ὥς·
 Round about him the proud wooers thronged, speaking him fair, but pondering evil in the deep of their hearts. Howbeit he avoided the great throng of these men, but where Mentor sat, and Antiphus, and Halitherses, who were friends of his father's house of old,	ἦ μὲν πολλαί γʼ αὐτὸν ἐθηήσαντο γυναῖκες. ἄλλο δέ τοι ἐρέω, σὺ δʼ ἐνὶ φρεσὶ βάλλεο σῇσιν· οὐκ οἶδʼ ἢ τάδε ἕστο περὶ χροῒ οἴκοθʼ Ὀδυσσεύς, ἦ τις ἑταίρων δῶκε θοῆς ἐπὶ νηὸς ἰόντι, ἤ τίς που καὶ ξεῖνος, ἐπεὶ πολλοῖσιν Ὀδυσσεὺς
there he went and sat down, and they questioned him of each thing. Then Peiraeus, the famous spearman, drew near, leading the stranger through the city to the place of assembly; and Telemachus did not long turn away from his guest, but went up to him. Then Peiraeus was the first to speak, saying:	ἔσκε φίλος· παῦροι γὰρ Ἀχαιῶν ἦσαν ὁμοῖοι. καί οἱ ἐγὼ χάλκειον ἄορ καὶ δίπλακα δῶκα καλὴν πορφυρέην καὶ τερμιόεντα χιτῶνα, αἰδοίως δʼ ἀπέπεμπον ἐϋσσέλμου ἐπὶ νηός. καὶ μέν οἱ κῆρυξ ὀλίγον προγενέστερος αὐτοῦ
“Telemachus, quickly send women to my house, that I may send to thee the gifts which Menelaus gave thee.” Then wise Telemachus answered him: “Peiraeus, we know not how these things will be. If the proud wooers	εἵπετο· καὶ τόν τοι μυθήσομαι, οἷος ἔην περ. γυρὸς ἐν ὤμοισιν, μελανόχροος, οὐλοκάρηνος, Εὐρυβάτης δʼ ὄνομʼ ἔσκε· τίεν δέ μιν ἔξοχον ἄλλων ὧν ἑτάρων Ὀδυσεύς, ὅτι οἱ φρεσὶν ἄρτια ᾔδη. ὣς φάτο, τῇ δʼ ἔτι μᾶλλον ὑφʼ ἵμερον ὦρσε γόοιο,
shall secretly slay me in my hall, and divide among them all the goods of my fathers, I would that thou shouldest keep and enjoy these things thyself rather than one of these. But if I shall sow for them the seeds of death and fate, then do thou bring all to my house gladly, as I shall be glad.” So saying, he led the sore-tired stranger to the house.	σήματʼ ἀναγνούσῃ τά οἱ ἔμπεδα πέφραδʼ Ὀδυσσεύς. ἡ δʼ ἐπεὶ οὖν τάρφθη πολυδακρύτοιο γόοιο. καὶ τότε μιν μύθοισιν ἀμειβομένη προσέειπε· νῦν μὲν δή μοι, ξεῖνε, πάρος περ ἐὼν ἐλεεινός, ἐν μεγάροισιν ἐμοῖσι φίλος τʼ ἔσῃ αἰδοῖός τε·
 Now when they had come to the stately house they laid their cloaks on the chairs and high seats, and went into the polished baths and bathed. And when the maids had bathed them and anointed them with oil, and had cast about them fleecy cloaks and tunics,	αὐτὴ γὰρ τάδε εἵματʼ ἐγὼ πόρον, οἷʼ ἀγορεύεις, πτύξασʼ ἐκ θαλάμου, περόνην τʼ ἐπέθηκα φαεινὴν κείνῳ ἄγαλμʼ ἔμεναι· τὸν δʼ οὐχ ὑποδέξομαι αὖτις οἴκαδε νοστήσαντα φίλην ἐς πατρίδα γαῖαν. τῷ ῥα κακῇ αἴσῃ κοίλης ἐπὶ νηὸς Ὀδυσσεὺς
 they came forth from the baths and sat down upon the chairs. Then a handmaid brought water for the hands in a fair pitcher of gold, and poured it over a silver basin for them to wash, and beside them drew up a polished table. And the grave housewife brought and set before them bread,	ᾤχετʼ ἐποψόμενος Κακοΐλιον οὐκ ὀνομαστήν. τὴν δʼ ἀπαμειβόμενος προσέφη πολύμητις Ὀδυσσεύς· ὦ γύναι αἰδοίη Λαερτιάδεω Ὀδυσῆος, μηκέτι νῦν χρόα καλὸν ἐναίρεο, μηδέ τι θυμὸν τῆκε, πόσιν γοόωσα. νεμεσσῶμαί γε μὲν οὐδέν·
 and therewith meats in abundance, granting freely of her store. And his mother sat over against Telemachus by the door-post of the hall, leaning against a chair and spinning fine threads of yarn. So they put forth their hands to the good cheer lying ready before them. But when they had put from them the desire of food and drink,	καὶ γάρ τίς τʼ ἀλλοῖον ὀδύρεται ἄνδρʼ ὀλέσασα κουρίδιον, τῷ τέκνα τέκῃ φιλότητι μιγεῖσα, ἢ Ὀδυσῆʼ, ὅν φασι θεοῖς ἐναλίγκιον εἶναι. ἀλλὰ γόου μὲν παῦσαι, ἐμεῖο δὲ σύνθεο μῦθον· νημερτέως γάρ τοι μυθήσομαι οὐδʼ ἐπικεύσω
the wise Penelope spoke first among them: “Telemachus, I truly will go to my upper chamber and lay me on my bed, which has become for me a bed of wailing, ever wet with my tears, since the day when Odysseus set forth with the sons of Atreus for Ilios . But thou tookest no care,	ὡς ἤδη Ὀδυσῆος ἐγὼ περὶ νόστου ἄκουσα ἀγχοῦ, Θεσπρωτῶν ἀνδρῶν ἐν πίονι δήμῳ, ζωοῦ· αὐτὰρ ἄγει κειμήλια πολλὰ καὶ ἐσθλὰ αἰτίζων ἀνὰ δῆμον. ἀτὰρ ἐρίηρας ἑταίρους ὤλεσε καὶ νῆα γλαφυρὴν ἐνὶ οἴνοπι πόντῳ,
before the proud wooers come into this house, to tell me plainly of the return of thy father, if haply thou heardest aught.” And wise Telemachus answered her: “Then verily, mother, I will tell thee all the truth. We went to Pylos and to Nestor, the shepherd of the people,	Θρινακίης ἄπο νήσου ἰών· ὀδύσαντο γὰρ αὐτῷ Ζεύς τε καὶ Ἠέλιος· τοῦ γὰρ βόας ἔκταν ἑταῖροι. οἱ μὲν πάντες ὄλοντο πολυκλύστῳ ἐνὶ πόντῳ· τὸν δʼ ἄρʼ ἐπὶ τρόπιος νεὸς ἔκβαλε κῦμʼ ἐπὶ χέρσου, Φαιήκων ἐς γαῖαν, οἳ ἀγχίθεοι γεγάασιν,
 and he received me in his lofty house and gave me kindly welcome, as a father might his own son who after a long time had newly come from a far: even so kindly he tended me with his glorious sons. Yet of Odysseus of the steadfast heart,	οἳ δή μιν περὶ κῆρι θεὸν ὣς τιμήσαντο καί οἱ πολλὰ δόσαν πέμπειν τέ μιν ἤθελον αὐτοὶ οἴκαδʼ ἀπήμαντον. καί κεν πάλαι ἐνθάδʼ Ὀδυσσεὺς ἤην· ἀλλʼ ἄρα οἱ τό γε κέρδιον εἴσατο θυμῷ, χρήματʼ ἀγυρτάζειν πολλὴν ἐπὶ γαῖαν ἰόντι·
whether living or dead, he said he had heard naught from any man on earth. But he sent me on my way with horses and jointed car to Menelaus, son of Atreus, the famous spearman. There I saw Argive Helen, for whose sake Argives and Trojans toiled much by the will of the gods.	ὣς περὶ κέρδεα πολλὰ καταθνητῶν ἀνθρώπων οἶδʼ Ὀδυσεύς, οὐδʼ ἄν τις ἐρίσσειε βροτὸς ἄλλος. ὥς μοι Θεσπρωτῶν βασιλεὺς μυθήσατο Φείδων· ὤμνυε δὲ πρὸς ἔμʼ αὐτόν, ἀποσπένδων ἐνὶ οἴκῳ, νῆα κατειρύσθαι καὶ ἐπαρτέας ἔμμεν ἑταίρους,
And straightway Menelaus, good at the war-cry, asked me in quest of what I had come to goodly Lacedaemon ; and I told him all the truth. Then he made answer to me, and said: “‘Out upon them! for verily in the bed of a man of valiant heart	οἳ δή μιν πέμψουσι φίλην ἐς πατρίδα γαῖαν. ἀλλʼ ἐμὲ πρὶν ἀπέπεμψε· τύχησε γὰρ ἐρχομένη νηῦς ἀνδρῶν Θεσπρωτῶν ἐς Δουλίχιον πολύπυρον. καί μοι κτήματʼ ἔδειξεν, ὅσα ξυναγείρατʼ Ὀδυσσεύς· καί νύ κεν ἐς δεκάτην γενεὴν ἕτερόν γʼ ἔτι βόσκοι,
 were they fain to lie, who are themselves cravens. Even as when in the thicket-lair of a mighty lion a hind has laid to sleep her new-born suckling fawns, and roams over the mountain slopes and grassy vales seeking pasture, and then the lion comes to his lair	ὅσσα οἱ ἐν μεγάροις κειμήλια κεῖτο ἄνακτος. τὸν δʼ ἐς Δωδώνην φάτο βήμεναι, ὄφρα θεοῖο ἐκ δρυὸς ὑψικόμοιο Διὸς βουλὴν ἐπακούσαι, ὅππως νοστήσειε φίλην ἐς πατρίδα γαῖαν ἤδη δὴν ἀπεών, ἤ ἀμφαδὸν ἦε κρυφηδόν.
and upon the two lets loose a cruel doom, so will Odysseus let loose a cruel doom upon these men. I would, O father Zeus, and Athena, and Apollo, that in such strength, as when once in fair-stablished Lesbos he rose up and wrestled a match with Philomeleides	ὣς ὁ μὲν οὕτως ἐστὶ σόος καὶ ἐλεύσεται ἤδη ἄγχι μάλʼ, οὐδʼ ἔτι τῆλε φίλων καὶ πατρίδος αἴης δηρὸν ἀπεσσεῖται· ἔμπης δέ τοι ὅρκια δώσω. ἴστω νῦν Ζεὺς πρῶτα, θεῶν ὕπατος καὶ ἄριστος, ἱστίη τʼ Ὀδυσῆος ἀμύμονος, ἣν ἀφικάνω·
 and threw him mightily, and all the Achaeans rejoiced, even in such strength Odysseus might come among the wooers; then should they all find swift destruction and bitterness in their wooing. But in this matter of which thou dost ask and entreat me, verily I will not swerve aside to speak of other things, nor will I deceive thee;	ἦ μέν τοι τάδε πάντα τελείεται ὡς ἀγορεύω. τοῦδʼ αὐτοῦ λυκάβαντος ἐλεύσεται ἐνθάδʼ Ὀδυσσεύς, τοῦ μὲν φθίνοντος μηνός, τοῦ δʼ ἱσταμένοιο. τὸν δʼ αὖτε προσέειπε περίφρων Πηνελόπεια· αἲ γὰρ τοῦτο, ξεῖνε, ἔπος τετελεσμένον εἴη·
 but of all that the unerring old man of the sea told me, not one thing will I hide from thee or conceal. He said that he had seen Odysseus in an island in grievous distress, in the halls of the nymph Calypso, who keeps him there perforce. And he cannot come to his own native land, for he has at hand no ships with oars, and no comrades,	τῷ κε τάχα γνοίης φιλότητά τε πολλά τε δῶρα ἐξ ἐμεῦ, ὡς ἄν τίς σε συναντόμενος μακαρίζοι. ἀλλά μοι ὧδʼ ἀνὰ θυμὸν ὀΐεται, ὡς ἔσεταί περ· οὔτʼ Ὀδυσεὺς ἔτι οἶκον ἐλεύσεται, οὔτε σὺ πομπῆς τεύξῃ, ἐπεὶ οὐ τοῖοι σημάντορές εἰσʼ ἐνὶ οἴκῳ
to send him on his way over the broad back of the sea.’ “So spoke Menelaus, son of Atreus, the famous spearman. Now when I had made an end of all this I set out for home, and the immortals gave me a fair wind and brought me quickly to my dear native land.”	οἷος Ὀδυσσεὺς ἔσκε μετʼ ἀνδράσιν, εἴ ποτʼ ἔην γε, ξείνους αἰδοίους ἀποπεμπέμεν ἠδὲ δέχεσθαι. ἀλλά μιν, ἀμφίπολοι, ἀπονίψατε, κάτθετε δʼ εὐνήν, δέμνια καὶ χλαίνας καὶ ῥήγεα σιγαλόεντα, ὥς κʼ εὖ θαλπιόων χρυσόθρονον Ἠῶ ἵκηται.
So he spoke, and stirred the heart in her breast. Then among them spoke also the godlike Theoclymenus, saying: “Honored wife of Odysseus, son of Laertes, he truly has no clear understanding; but do thou hearken to my words, for with certain knowledge will I prophesy to thee, and will hide naught.	ἠῶθεν δὲ μάλʼ ἦρι λοέσσαι τε χρῖσαί τε, ὥς κʼ ἔνδον παρὰ Τηλεμάχῳ δείπνοιο μέδηται ἥμενος ἐν μεγάρῳ· τῷ δʼ ἄλγιον ὅς κεν ἐκείνων τοῦτον ἀνιάζῃ θυμοφθόρος· οὐδέ τι ἔργον ἐνθάδʼ ἔτι πρήξει, μάλα περ κεχολωμένος αἰνῶς.
 Be my witness Zeus above all gods, and this hospitable board and the hearth of noble Odysseus to which I am come, that verily Odysseus is even now in his native land, resting or moving, learning of these evil deeds, and he is sowing the seeds of evil for all the wooers.	πῶς γὰρ ἐμεῦ σύ, ξεῖνε, δαήσεαι εἴ τι γυναικῶν ἀλλάων περίειμι νόον καὶ ἐπίφρονα μῆτιν, εἴ κεν ἀϋσταλέος, κακὰ εἱμένος ἐν μεγάροισιν δαινύῃ; ἄνθρωποι δὲ μινυνθάδιοι τελέθουσιν. ὃς μὲν ἀπηνὴς αὐτὸς ἔῃ καὶ ἀπηνέα εἰδῇ,
So plain a bird of omen did I mark as I sat on the benched ship, and I declared it to Telemachus.” Then wise Penelope answered him: “Ah, stranger, I would that this word of thine might be fulfilled. Then shouldest thou straightway know of kindness and many a gift	τῷ δὲ καταρῶνται πάντες βροτοὶ ἄλγεʼ ὀπίσσω ζωῷ, ἀτὰρ τεθνεῶτί γʼ ἐφεψιόωνται ἅπαντες· ὃς δʼ ἂν ἀμύμων αὐτὸς ἔῃ καὶ ἀμύμονα εἰδῇ, τοῦ μέν τε κλέος εὐρὺ δὶα ξεῖνοι φορέουσι πάντας ἐπʼ ἀνθρώπους, πολλοί τέ μιν ἐσθλὸν ἔειπον.
from me, so that one who met thee would call the blessed.” Thus they spoke to one another. And the wooers meanwhile in front of the palace of Odysseus were making merry, throwing the discus and the javelin in a levelled place, as their wont was, in insolence of heart.	τὴν δʼ ἀπαμειβόμενος προσέφη πολύμητις Ὀδυσσεύς· ὦ γύναι αἰδοίη Λαερτιάδεω Ὀδυσῆος, ἦ τοι ἐμοὶ χλαῖναι καὶ ῥήγεα σιγαλόεντα ἤχθεθʼ, ὅτε πρῶτον Κρήτης ὄρεα νιφόεντα νοσφισάμην ἐπὶ νηὸς ἰὼν δολιχηρέτμοιο,
But when it was the hour for dinner, and the flocks came in from all sides from the fields, and the men led them who were wont to lead, then Medon, who of all the heralds was most to their liking and was ever present at their feasts, spoke to them, saying: “Youths, now that you have all made glad your hearts with sport,	κείω δʼ ὡς τὸ πάρος περ ἀΰπνους νύκτας ἴαυον· πολλὰς γὰρ δὴ νύκτας ἀεικελίῳ ἐνὶ κοίτῃ ἄεσα καί τʼ ἀνέμεινα ἐΰθρονον Ἠῶ δῖαν. οὐδέ τί μοι ποδάνιπτρα ποδῶν ἐπιήρανα θυμῷ γίγνεται· οὐδὲ γυνὴ ποδὸς ἅψεται ἡμετέροιο
come to the house that we may make ready a feast; for it is no bad thing to take one's dinner in season.” So he spoke, and they rose up and went, and hearkened to his word. And when they had come to the stately house they laid their cloaks on the chairs and high seats,	τάων αἵ τοι δῶμα κάτα δρήστειραι ἔασιν, εἰ μή τις γρηῦς ἔστι παλαιή, κεδνὰ ἰδυῖα, ἥ τις δὴ τέτληκε τόσα φρεσὶν ὅσσα τʼ ἐγώ περ· τῇ δʼ οὐκ ἂν φθονέοιμι ποδῶν ἅψασθαι ἐμεῖο. τὸν δʼ αὖτε προσέειπε περίφρων Πηνελόπεια·
and men fell to slaying great sheep and fat goats, aye, and fatted and swine, and a heifer of the herd, and so made ready the meal. But Odysseus and the goodly swineherd were making haste to go from the field to the city; and the swineherd, a leader of men, spoke first, and said:	ξεῖνε φίλʼ· οὐ γάρ πώ τις ἀνὴρ πεπνυμένος ὧδε ξείνων τηλεδαπῶν φιλίων ἐμὸν ἵκετο δῶμα, ὡς σὺ μάλʼ εὐφραδέως πεπνυμένα πάντʼ ἀγορεύεις· ἔστι δέ μοι γρηῢς πυκινὰ φρεσὶ μήδεʼ ἔχουσα ἣ κεῖνον δύστηνον ἐῢ τρέφεν ἠδʼ ἀτίταλλε,
 “Stranger, since thou art eager to go the city today, as my master bade—though for myself I would rather have thee left here to keep the farmstead; but I reverence and fear him, lest hereafter he chide me, and hard are the rebukes of masters—	δεξαμένη χείρεσσʼ, ὅτε μιν πρῶτον τέκε μήτηρ, ἥ σε πόδας νίψει, ὀλιγηπελέουσά περ ἔμπης. ἀλλʼ ἄγε νῦν ἀνστᾶσα, περίφρων Εὐρύκλεια, νίψον σοῖο ἄνακτος ὁμήλικα· καί που Ὀδυσσεὺς ἤδη τοιόσδʼ ἐστὶ πόδας τοιόσδε τε χεῖρας·
come now, let us go. The day is far spent, and soon thou wilt find it colder toward evening.” Then Odysseus of many wiles answered him, and said: “I see, I give heed; this thou biddest one with understanding. Come, let us go, and be thou my guide all the way.	αἶψα γὰρ ἐν κακότητι βροτοὶ καταγηράσκουσιν. ὣς ἄρʼ ἔφη, γρηῢς δὲ κατέσχετο χερσὶ πρόσωπα, δάκρυα δʼ ἔκβαλε θερμά, ἔπος δʼ ὀλοφυδνὸν ἔειπεν· ὤ μοι ἐγὼ σέο, τέκνον, ἀμήχανος· ἦ σε περὶ Ζεὺς ἀνθρώπων ἤχθηρε θεουδέα θυμὸν ἔχοντα.
But give me a staff to lean upon, if thou hast one cut anywhere, for verily ye said that the way was treacherous.” He spoke, and flung about his shoulders his miserable wallet, full of holes, slung by a twisted cord, and Eumaeus gave him a staff to his liking.	οὐ γάρ πώ τις τόσσα βροτῶν Διὶ τερπικεραύνῳ πίονα μηρίʼ ἔκηʼ οὐδʼ ἐξαίτους ἑκατόμβας, ὅσσα σὺ τῷ ἐδίδους, ἀρώμενος ἧος ἵκοιο γῆράς τε λιπαρὸν θρέψαιό τε φαίδιμον υἱόν· νῦν δέ τοι οἴῳ πάμπαν ἀφείλετο νόστιμον ἦμαρ.
So they two set forth, and the dogs and the herdsmen stayed behind to guard the farmstead; but the swineherd led his master to the city in the likeness of a woeful and aged beggar, leaning on a staff; and miserable was the raiment that he wore about his body. But when, as they went along the rugged path,	οὕτω που καὶ κείνῳ ἐφεψιόωντο γυναῖκες ξείνων τηλεδαπῶν, ὅτε τευ κλυτὰ δώμαθʼ ἵκοιτο, ὡς σέθεν αἱ κύνες αἵδε καθεψιόωνται ἅπασαι, τάων νῦν λώβην τε καὶ αἴσχεα πόλλʼ ἀλεείνων οὐκ ἐάας νίζειν· ἐμὲ δʼ οὐκ ἀέκουσαν ἄνωγε
 they were near the city, and had come to a well-wrought, fair-flowing fountain, wherefrom the townsfolk drew water—this Ithacus had made, and Neritus, and Polyctor, and around was a grove of poplars, that grow by the waters, circling it on all sides, and down the cold water flowed	κούρη Ἰκαρίοιο, περίφρων Πηνελόπεια. τῷ σε πόδας νίψω ἅμα τʼ αὐτῆς Πηνελοπείης καὶ σέθεν εἵνεκʼ, ἐπεί μοι ὀρώρεται ἔνδοθι θυμὸς κήδεσιν. ἀλλʼ ἄγε νῦν ξυνίει ἔπος, ὅττι κεν εἴπω· πολλοὶ δὴ ξεῖνοι ταλαπείριοι ἐνθάδʼ ἵκοντο,
 from the rock above, and on the top was built an altar to the nymphs where all passers-by made offerings—there Melantheus, son of Dolius, met them as he was driving his she-goats, the best that were in all the herds, to make a feast for the wooers; and two herdsmen followed with him.	ἀλλʼ οὔ πώ τινά φημι ἐοικότα ὧδε ἰδέσθαι ὡς σὺ δέμας φωνήν τε πόδας τʼ Ὀδυσῆϊ ἔοικας. τὴν δʼ ἀπαμειβόμενος προσέφη πολύμητις Ὀδυσσεύς· ὦ γρηῦ, οὕτω φασὶν ὅσοι ἴδον ὀφθαλμοῖσιν ἡμέας ἀμφοτέρους, μάλα εἰκέλω ἀλλήλοιϊν
As he saw them, he spoke and addressed them, and reviled them in terrible and unseemly words, and stirred the heart of Odysseus: “Lo, now, in very truth the vile leads the vile. As ever, the god is bringing like and like together. Whither, pray, art thou leading this filthy wretch, thou miserable swineherd,	ἔμμεναι, ὡς σύ περ αὐτὴ ἐπιφρονέουσʼ ἀγορεύεις. ὣς ἄρʼ ἔφη, γρηῢς δὲ λέβηθʼ ἕλε παμφανόωντα τοῦ πόδας ἐξαπένιζεν, ὕδωρ δʼ ἐνεχεύατο πουλὺ ψυχρόν, ἔπειτα δὲ θερμὸν ἐπήφυσεν. αὐτὰρ Ὀδυσσεὺς ἷζεν ἐπʼ ἐσχαρόφιν, ποτὶ δὲ σκότον ἐτράπετʼ αἶψα·
this nuisance of a beggar to mar our feasts? He is a man to stand and rub his shoulders on many doorposts, begging for scraps, not for swords or cauldrons. If thou wouldest give me this fellow to keep my farmstead, to sweep out the pens and to carry young shoots to the kids,	αὐτίκα γὰρ κατὰ θυμὸν ὀΐσατο, μή ἑ λαβοῦσα οὐλὴν ἀμφράσσαιτο καὶ ἀμφαδὰ ἔργα γένοιτο. νίζε δʼ ἄρʼ ἆσσον ἰοῦσα ἄναχθʼ ἑόν· αὐτίκα δʼ ἔγνω οὐλήν, τήν ποτέ μιν σῦς ἤλασε λευκῷ ὀδόντι Παρνησόνδʼ ἐλθόντα μετʼ Αὐτόλυκόν τε καὶ υἷας,
 then by drinking whey he might get himself a sturdy thigh. But since he has learned only deeds of evil, he will not care to busy himself with work, but is minded rather to go skulking through the land, that by begging he may feed his insatiate belly. But I will speak out to thee, and this word shall verily be brought to pass.	μητρὸς ἑῆς πάτερʼ ἐσθλόν, ὃς ἀνθρώπους ἐκέκαστο κλεπτοσύνῃ θʼ ὅρκῳ τε· θεὸς δέ οἱ αὐτὸς ἔδωκεν Ἑρμείας· τῷ γὰρ κεχαρισμένα μηρία καῖεν ἀρνῶν ἠδʼ ἐρίφων· ὁ δέ οἱ πρόφρων ἅμʼ ὀπήδει. Αὐτόλυκος δʼ ἐλθὼν Ἰθάκης ἐς πίονα δῆμον
If he comes to the palace of divine Odysseus, many a footstool, hurled about his head by the hands of those that are men, shall be broken on his ribs as he is pelted through the house.” So he spoke, and as he passed he kicked Odysseus on the hip in his folly, yet he did not drive him from the path,	παῖδα νέον γεγαῶτα κιχήσατο θυγατέρος ἧς· τόν ῥά οἱ Εὐρύκλεια φίλοις ἐπὶ γούνασι θῆκε παυομένῳ δόρποιο, ἔπος τʼ ἔφατʼ ἔκ τʼ ὀνόμαζεν· Αὐτόλυκʼ, αὐτὸς νῦν ὄνομʼ εὕρεο ὅττι κε θῆαι παιδὸς παιδὶ φίλῳ· πολυάρητος δέ τοί ἐστιν.
 “Nymphs of the fountain, daughters of Zeus, if ever Odysseus burned upon your altars pieces of the thighs of lambs or kids, wrapped in rich fat, fulfil for me this prayer; grant that he, my master, may come back, and that some god may guide him. Then would he scatter all the proud airs	τὴν δʼ αὖτʼ Αὐτόλυκος ἀπαμείβετο φώνησέν τε· γαμβρὸς ἐμὸς θυγάτηρ τε, τίθεσθʼ ὄνομʼ ὅττι κεν εἴπω· πολλοῖσιν γὰρ ἐγώ γε ὀδυσσάμενος τόδʼ ἱκάνω, ἀνδράσιν ἠδὲ γυναιξὶν ἀνὰ χθόνα πουλυβότειραν· τῷ δʼ Ὀδυσεὺς ὄνομʼ ἔστω ἐπώνυμον· αὐτὰρ ἐγώ γε,
which now thou puttest on in thy insolence,ever roaming about the city, while evil herdsmen destroy the flock.” Then Melanthius, the goatherd, answered him: “Lo now, how the cur talks, his mind full of mischief. Him will I some day	ὁππότʼ ἂν ἡβήσας μητρώϊον ἐς μέγα δῶμα ἔλθῃ Παρνησόνδʼ, ὅθι πού μοι κτήματʼ ἔασι, τῶν οἱ ἐγὼ δώσω καί μιν χαίροντʼ ἀποπέμψω. τῶν ἕνεκʼ ἦλθʼ Ὀδυσεύς, ἵνα οἱ πόροι ἀγλαὰ δῶρα. τὸν μὲν ἄρʼ Αὐτόλυκός τε καὶ υἱέες Αὐτολύκοιο
take on a black, benched ship far from Ithaca , that he may bring me in much wealth. Would that Apollo, of the silver bow, might smite Telemachus to-day in the halls, or that he might be slain by the wooers, as surely as for Odysseus in a far land the day of return has been lost.” So saying, he left them there, as they walked slowly on,	χερσίν τʼ ἠσπάζοντο ἔπεσσί τε μειλιχίοισι· μήτηρ δʼ Ἀμφιθέη μητρὸς περιφῦσʼ Ὀδυσῆϊ κύσσʼ ἄρα μιν κεφαλήν τε καὶ ἄμφω φάεα καλά. Αὐτόλυκος δʼ υἱοῖσιν ἐκέκλετο κυδαλίμοισι δεῖπνον ἐφοπλίσσαι· τοὶ δʼ ὀτρύνοντος ἄκουσαν,
 but himself strode forward and right swiftly came to the palace of the king. Straightway he entered in and sat down among the wooers over against Eurymachus, for he loved him best of all. Then by him those that served set a portion of meat, and the grave housewife brought and set before him bread,	αὐτίκα δʼ εἰσάγαγον βοῦν ἄρσενα πενταέτηρον· τὸν δέρον ἀμφί θʼ ἕπον, καί μιν διέχευαν ἅπαντα, μίστυλλόν τʼ ἄρʼ ἐπισταμένως πεῖράν τʼ ὀβελοῖσιν, ὤπτησάν τε περιφραδέως, δάσσαντό τε μοίρας. ὣς τότε μὲν πρόπαν ἦμαρ ἐς ἠέλιον καταδύντα
for him to eat. And Odysseus and the goodly swineherd halted as they drew nigh, and about them rang the sound of the hollow lyre, for Phemius was striking the chords to sing before the wooers. Then Odysseus clasped the swineherd by the hand, and said: “Eumaeus, surely this is the beautiful house of Odysseus.	δαίνυντʼ, οὐδέ τι θυμὸς ἐδεύετο δαιτὸς ἐΐσης· ἦμος δʼ ἠέλιος κατέδυ καὶ ἐπὶ κνέφας ἦλθεν, δὴ τότε κοιμήσαντο καὶ ὕπνου δῶρον ἕλοντο. ἦμος δʼ ἠριγένεια φάνη ῥοδοδάκτυλος Ἠώς, βάν ῥʼ ἴμεν ἐς θήρην, ἠμὲν κύνες ἠδὲ καὶ αὐτοὶ
 Easily might it be known, though seen among many. There is building upon building, and the court is built with wall and coping, and the double gates are well-fenced; no man may scorn it. And I mark that in the house itself many	υἱέες Αὐτολύκου· μετὰ τοῖσι δὲ δῖος Ὀδυσσεὺς ἤϊεν· αἰπὺ δʼ ὄρος προσέβαν καταειμένον ὕλῃ Παρνησοῦ, τάχα δʼ ἵκανον πτύχας ἠνεμοέσσας. Ἠέλιος μὲν ἔπειτα νέον προσέβαλλεν ἀρούρας ἐξ ἀκαλαρρείταο βαθυρρόου Ὠκεανοῖο,
men are feasting: for the savour of meat arises from it, and therewith resounds the voice of the lyre, which the gods have made the companion of the feast.” To him then, swineherd Eumaeus, didst thou make answer, and say: “Easily hast thou marked it, for in all things thou art ready of wit. But come, let us take thought how these things shall be.	οἱ δʼ ἐς βῆσσαν ἵκανον ἐπακτῆρες· πρὸ δʼ ἄρʼ αὐτῶν ἴχνιʼ ἐρευνῶντες κύνες ἤϊσαν, αὐτὰρ ὄπισθεν υἱέες Αὐτολύκου· μετὰ τοῖσι δὲ δῖος Ὀδυσσεὺς ἤϊεν ἄγχι κυνῶν, κραδάων δολιχόσκιον ἔγχος. ἔνθα δʼ ἄρʼ ἐν λόχμῃ πυκινῇ κατέκειτο μέγας σῦς·
Either do thou go first into the stately palace, and enter the company of the wooers, and I will remain behind here, or, if thou wilt, remain thou here and I will go before thee. But do not thou linger long, lest some man see thee without and pelt thee or smite thee. Of this I bid thee take thought.”	τὴν μὲν ἄρʼ οὔτʼ ἀνέμων διάει μένος ὑγρὸν ἀέντων, οὔτε μιν Ἠέλιος φαέθων ἀκτῖσιν ἔβαλλεν, οὔτʼ ὄμβρος περάασκε διαμπερές· ὣς ἄρα πυκνὴ ἦεν, ἀτὰρ φύλλων ἐνέην χύσις ἤλιθα πολλή. τὸν δʼ ἀνδρῶν τε κυνῶν τε περὶ κτύπος ἦλθε ποδοῖϊν,
 Then the much-enduring, goodly Odysseus answered him: “I see, I give heed: this thou biddest one with understanding. But go thou before, and I will remain behind here; for no whit unused am I to blows and peltings. Staunch is my heart, for much evil have I suffered	ὡς ἐπάγοντες ἐπῇσαν· ὁ δʼ ἀντίος ἐκ ξυλόχοιο φρίξας εὖ λοφιήν, πῦρ δʼ ὀφθαλμοῖσι δεδορκώς, στῆ ῥʼ αὐτῶν σχεδόθεν· ὁ δʼ ἄρα πρώτιστος Ὀδυσσεὺς ἔσσυτʼ ἀνασχόμενος δολιχὸν δόρυ χειρὶ παχείῃ, οὐτάμεναι μεμαώς· ὁ δέ μιν φθάμενος ἔλασεν σῦς
amid the waves and in war; let this too be added to what has gone before. But a ravening belly may no man hide, an accursed plague that brings many evils upon men. Because of it are the benched ships also made ready, that bear evil to foemen over the unresting sea.”	γουνὸς ὕπερ, πολλὸν δὲ διήφυσε σαρκὸς ὀδόντι λικριφὶς ἀΐξας, οὐδʼ ὀστέον ἵκετο φωτός. τὸν δʼ Ὀδυσεὺς οὔτησε τυχὼν κατὰ δεξιὸν ὦμον, ἀντικρὺ δὲ διῆλθε φαεινοῦ δουρὸς ἀκωκή· κὰδ δʼ ἔπεσʼ ἐν κονίῃσι μακών, ἀπὸ δʼ ἔπτατο θυμός.
Thus they spoke to one another. And a hound that lay there raised his head and pricked up his ears, Argos , the hound of Odysseus, of the steadfast heart, whom of old he had himself bred, but had no joy of him, for ere that he went to sacred Ilios . In days past the young men were wont to take the hound to hunt	τὸν μὲν ἄρʼ Αὐτολύκου παῖδες φίλοι ἀμφεπένοντο, ὠτειλὴν δʼ Ὀδυσῆος ἀμύμονος ἀντιθέοιο δῆσαν ἐπισταμένως, ἐπαοιδῇ δʼ αἷμα κελαινὸν ἔσχεθον, αἶψα δʼ ἵκοντο φίλου πρὸς δώματα πατρός. τὸν μὲν ἄρʼ Αὐτόλυκός τε καὶ υἱέες Αὐτολύκοιο
 the wild goats, and deer, and hares; but now he lay neglected, his master gone, in the deep dung of mules and cattle, which lay in heaps before the doors, till the slaves of Odysseus should take it away to dung his wide lands.	εὖ ἰησάμενοι ἠδʼ ἀγλαὰ δῶρα πορόντες καρπαλίμως χαίροντα φίλην ἐς πατρίδʼ ἔπεμπον εἰς Ἰθάκην. τῷ μέν ῥα πατὴρ καὶ πότνια μήτηρ χαῖρον νοστήσαντι καὶ ἐξερέεινον ἕκαστα, οὐλὴν ὅττι πάθοι· ὁ δʼ ἄρα σφίσιν εὖ κατέλεξεν
There lay the hound Argos , full of vermin; yet even now, when he marked Odysseus standing near, he wagged his tail and dropped both his ears, but nearer to his master he had no longer strength to move. Then Odysseus looked aside and wiped away a tear,	ὥς μιν θηρεύοντʼ ἔλασεν σῦς λευκῷ ὀδόντι, Παρνησόνδʼ ἐλθόντα σὺν υἱάσιν Αὐτολύκοιο. τὴν γρηῢς χείρεσσι καταπρηνέσσι λαβοῦσα γνῶ ῥʼ ἐπιμασσαμένη, πόδα δὲ προέηκε φέρεσθαι· ἐν δὲ λέβητι πέσε κνήμη, κανάχησε δὲ χαλκός,
easily hiding from Eumaeus what he did; and straightway he questioned him, and said: “Eumaeus, verily it is strange that this hound lies here in the dung. He is fine of form, but I do not clearly know whether he has speed of foot to match this beauty or whether he is merely as table-dogs	ἂψ δʼ ἑτέρωσʼ ἐκλίθη· τὸ δʼ ἐπὶ χθονὸς ἐξέχυθʼ ὕδωρ. τὴν δʼ ἅμα χάρμα καὶ ἄλγος ἕλε φρένα, τὼ δέ οἱ ὄσσε δακρυόφι πλῆσθεν, θαλερὴ δέ οἱ ἔσχετο φωνή. ἁψαμένη δὲ γενείου Ὀδυσσῆα προσέειπεν· ἦ μάλʼ Ὀδυσσεύς ἐσσι, φίλον τέκος· οὐδέ σʼ ἐγώ γε
are, which their masters keep for show.” To him then, swineherd Eumaeus, didst thou make answer and say: “Aye, verily this is the hound of a man that has died in a far land. If he were but in form and in action such as he was when Odysseus left him and went to Troy ,	πρὶν ἔγνων, πρὶν πάντα ἄνακτʼ ἐμὸν ἀμφαφάασθαι. ἦ καὶ Πηνελόπειαν ἐσέδρακεν ὀφθαλμοῖσι, πεφραδέειν ἐθέλουσα φίλον πόσιν ἔνδον ἐόντα. ἡ δʼ οὔτʼ ἀθρῆσαι δύνατʼ ἀντίη οὔτε νοῆσαι· τῇ γὰρ Ἀθηναίη νόον ἔτραπεν· αὐτὰρ Ὀδυσσεὺς
 thou wouldest soon be amazed at seeing his speed and his strength. No creature that he started in the depths of the thick wood could escape him, and in tracking too he was keen of scent. But now he is in evil plight, and his master has perished far from his native land, and the heedless women give him no care.	χεῖρʼ ἐπιμασσάμενος φάρυγος λάβε δεξιτερῆφι, τῇ δʼ ἑτέρῃ ἕθεν ἆσσον ἐρύσσατο φώνησέν τε. μαῖα, τίη μʼ ἐθέλεις ὀλέσαι; σὺ δέ μʼ ἔτρεφες αὐτὴ τῷ σῷ ἐπὶ μαζῷ· νῦν δʼ ἄλγεα πολλὰ μογήσας ἤλυθον εἰκοστῷ ἔτεϊ ἐς πατρίδα γαῖαν.
Slaves, when their masters lose their power, are no longer minded thereafter to do honest service: for Zeus, whose voice is borne afar, takes away half his worth from a man, when the day of slavery comes upon him.” So saying, he entered the stately house	ἀλλʼ ἐπεὶ ἐφράσθης καί τοι θεὸς ἔμβαλε θυμῷ, σίγα, μή τίς τʼ ἄλλος ἐνὶ μεγάροισι πύθηται. ὧδε γὰρ ἐξερέω, καὶ μὴν τετελεσμένον ἔσται· εἴ χʼ ὑπʼ ἐμοί γε θεὸς δαμάσῃ μνηστῆρας ἀγαυούς, οὐδὲ τροφοῦ οὔσης σεῦ ἀφέξομαι, ὁππότʼ ἂν ἄλλας
and went straight to the hall to join the company of the lordly wooers. But as for Argos , the fate of black death seized him straightway when he had seen Odysseus in the twentieth year. Now as the swineherd came through the hall godlike Telemachus was far the first to see him, and quickly	δμῳὰς ἐν μεγάροισιν ἐμοῖς κτείνωμι γυναῖκας. τὸν δʼ αὖτε προσέειπε περίφρων Εὐρύκλεια· τέκνον ἐμόν, ποῖόν σε ἔπος φύγεν ἕρκος ὀδόντων. οἶσθα μὲν οἷον ἐμὸν μένος ἔμπεδον οὐδʼ ἐπιεικτόν, ἕξω δʼ ὡς ὅτε τις στερεὴ λίθος ἠὲ σίδηρος.
 with a nod he called him and to his side. And Eumaeus looked about him and took a stool that lay near, on which the carver was wont to sit when carving for the wooers the many joints of meat, as they feasted in the hall. This he took and placed at the table of Telemachus, over against him, and there sat down himself. And a herald	ἄλλο δέ τοι ἐρέω, σὺ δʼ ἐνὶ φρεσὶ βάλλεο σῇσιν· εἴ χʼ ὑπό σοι γε θεὸς δαμάσῃ μνηστῆρας ἀγαυούς, δὴ τότε τοι καταλέξω ἐνὶ μεγάροισι γυναῖκας, αἵ τέ σʼ ἀτιμάζουσι καὶ αἳ νηλείτιδές εἰσι. τὴν δʼ ἀπαμειβόμενος προσέφη πολύμητις Ὀδυσσεύς
took a portion of meat and set it before him, and bread from out the basket. Night after him Odysseus entered the palace in the likeness of a woeful and aged beggar, leaning on a staff, and miserable was the raiment that he wore about his body. He sat down upon the ashen threshold within the doorway,	μαῖα, τίη δὲ σὺ τὰς μυθήσεαι; οὐδέ τί σε χρή. εὖ νυ καὶ αὐτὸς ἐγὼ φράσομαι καὶ εἴσομʼ ἑκάστην· ἀλλʼ ἔχε σιγῇ μῦθον, ἐπίτρεψον δὲ θεοῖσιν. ὣς ἄρʼ ἔφη, γρηῢς δὲ διὲκ μεγάροιο βεβήκει οἰσομένη ποδάνιπτρα· τὰ γὰρ πρότερʼ ἔκχυτο πάντα.
leaning against a post of cypress wood, which of old a carpenter had skilfully planed, and made straight to the line. Then Telemachus called the swineherd to him, and, taking a whole loaf from out the beautiful basket, and all the meat his hands could hold in their grasp, spoke to him saying:	αὐτὰρ ἐπεὶ νίψεν τε καὶ ἤλειψεν λίπʼ ἐλαίῳ, αὖτις ἄρʼ ἀσσοτέρω πυρὸς ἕλκετο δίφρον Ὀδυσσεὺς θερσόμενος, οὐλὴν δὲ κατὰ ῥακέεσσι κάλυψε. τοῖσι δὲ μύθων ἦρχε περίφρων Πηνελόπεια· ξεῖνε, τὸ μέν σʼ ἔτι τυτθὸν ἐγὼν εἰρήσομαι αὐτή·
“Take, and give this mess to yon stranger, and bid him go about himself and beg of the wooers one and all. Shame is no good comrade for a man that is in need.” So he spoke, and the swineherd went, when he had heard this saying, and coming up to Odysseus spoke to him winged words:	καὶ γὰρ δὴ κοίτοιο τάχʼ ἔσσεται ἡδέος ὥρη, ὅν τινά γʼ ὕπνος ἕλοι γλυκερός, καὶ κηδόμενόν περ. αὐτὰρ ἐμοὶ καὶ πένθος ἀμέτρητον πόρε δαίμων· ἤματα μὲν γὰρ τέρπομʼ ὀδυρομένη, γοόωσα, ἔς τʼ ἐμὰ ἔργʼ ὁρόωσα καὶ ἀμφιπόλων ἐνὶ οἴκῳ·
“Stranger, Telemachus gives thee these, and bids thee go about and beg of the wooers one and all. Shame, he says, is no good thing in a beggar man.” Then Odysseus of many wiles answered him, and said, “King Zeus, grant, I pray thee, that Telemachus may be blest among men,	αὐτὰρ ἐπὴν νὺξ ἔλθῃ, ἕλῃσί τε κοῖτος ἅπαντας, κεῖμαι ἐνὶ λέκτρῳ, πυκιναὶ δέ μοι ἀμφʼ ἀδινὸν κῆρ ὀξεῖαι μελεδῶνες ὀδυρομένην ἐρέθουσιν. ὡς δʼ ὅτε Πανδαρέου κούρη, χλωρηῒς ἀηδών, καλὸν ἀείδῃσιν ἔαρος νέον ἱσταμένοιο,
and may have all that his heart desires.” He spoke, and took the mess in both his hands and set it down there before his feet on his miserable wallet. Then he ate so long as the minstrel sang in the halls. But when he had dined and the divine minstrel was ceasing to sing,	δενδρέων ἐν πετάλοισι καθεζομένη πυκινοῖσιν, ἥ τε θαμὰ τρωπῶσα χέει πολυηχέα φωνήν, παῖδʼ ὀλοφυρομένη Ἴτυλον φίλον, ὅν ποτε χαλκῷ κτεῖνε διʼ ἀφραδίας, κοῦρον Ζήθοιο ἄνακτος, ὣς καὶ ἐμοὶ δίχα θυμὸς ὀρώρεται ἔνθα καὶ ἔνθα,
 the wooers broke into uproar throughout the halls; but Athena drew close to the side of Odysseus, son of Laertes, and roused him to go among the wooers and gather bits of bread, and learn which of them were righteous and which lawless. Yet even so she was not minded to save one of them from ruin.	ἠὲ μένω παρὰ παιδὶ καὶ ἔμπεδα πάντα φυλάσσω, κτῆσιν ἐμήν, δμῶάς τε καὶ ὑψερεφὲς μέγα δῶμα, εὐνήν τʼ αἰδομένη πόσιος δήμοιό τε φῆμιν, ἦ ἤδη ἅμʼ ἕπωμαι Ἀχαιῶν ὅς τις ἄριστος μνᾶται ἐνὶ μεγάροισι, πορὼν ἀπερείσια ἕδνα.
So he set out to beg of every man, beginning on the right, stretching out his hand on every side, as though he had been long a beggar. And they pitied him and gave, and marvelled at him, asking one another who he was and whence he came. Then among them spoke Melanthius, the goatherd:	παῖς δʼ ἐμὸς ἧος ἔην ἔτι νήπιος ἠδὲ χαλίφρων, γήμασθʼ οὔ μʼ εἴα πόσιος κατὰ δῶμα λιποῦσαν· νῦν δʼ ὅτε δὴ μέγας ἐστὶ καὶ ἥβης μέτρον ἱκάνει, καὶ δή μʼ ἀρᾶται πάλιν ἐλθέμεν ἐκ μεγάροιο, κτήσιος ἀσχαλόων, τήν οἱ κατέδουσιν Ἀχαιοί.
“Hear me, wooers of the glorious queen, regarding this stranger, for verily I have seen him before. Truly it was the swineherd that led him hither, but of the man himself I know not surely from whence he declares his birth to be.” So he spoke, and Antinous rebuked the swineherd, saying:	ἀλλʼ ἄγε μοι τὸν ὄνειρον ὑπόκριναι καὶ ἄκουσον. χῆνές μοι κατὰ οἶκον ἐείκοσι πυρὸν ἔδουσιν ἐξ ὕδατος, καί τέ σφιν ἰαίνομαι εἰσορόωσα· ἐλθὼν δʼ ἐξ ὄρεος μέγας αἰετὸς ἀγκυλοχείλης πᾶσι κατʼ αὐχένας ἦξε καὶ ἔκτανεν· οἱ δʼ ἐκέχυντο
“Notorious swineherd, why, pray, didst thou bring this man to the city? Have we not vagabonds enough without him, nuisances of beggars to mar our feast? Dost thou not think it enough that they gather here and devour the substance of thy master, that thou dost bid this fellow too?”	ἀθρόοι ἐν μεγάροις, ὁ δʼ ἐς αἰθέρα δῖαν ἀέρθη. αὐτὰρ ἐγὼ κλαῖον καὶ ἐκώκυον ἔν περ ὀνείρῳ, ἀμφὶ δʼ ἔμʼ ἠγερέθοντο ἐϋπλοκαμῖδες Ἀχαιαί, οἴκτρʼ ὀλοφυρομένην ὅ μοι αἰετὸς ἔκτανε χῆνας. ἂψ δʼ ἐλθὼν κατʼ ἄρʼ ἕζετʼ ἐπὶ προὔχοντι μελάθρῳ,
 To him then, swineherd Eumaeus, didst thou make answer, and say: “Antinous, no fair words are these thou speakest, noble though thou art. Who pray, of himself ever seeks out and bids a stranger from abroad, unless it be one of those that are masters of some public craft, a prophet, or a healer of ills, or a builder,	φωνῇ δὲ βροτέῃ κατερήτυε φώνησέν τε· θάρσει, Ἰκαρίου κούρη τηλεκλειτοῖο· οὐκ ὄναρ, ἀλλʼ ὕπαρ ἐσθλόν, ὅ τοι τετελεσμένον ἔσται. χῆνες μὲν μνηστῆρες, ἐγὼ δέ τοι αἰετὸς ὄρνις ἦα πάρος, νῦν αὖτε τεὸς πόσις εἰλήλουθα,
 aye, or a divine minstrel, who gives delight with his song? For these men are bidden all over the boundless earth. Yet a beggar would no man bid to be burden to himself. But thou art ever harsh above all the wooers to the slaves of Odysseus, and most of all to me; yet I	ὃς πᾶσι μνηστῆρσιν ἀεικέα πότμον ἐφήσω. ὣς ἔφατʼ, αὐτὰρ ἐμὲ μελιηδὴς ὕπνος ἀνῆκε· παπτήνασα δὲ χῆνας ἐνὶ μεγάροισι νόησα πυρὸν ἐρεπτομένους παρὰ πύελον, ἧχι πάρος περ. τὴν δʼ ἀπαμειβόμενος προσέφη πολύμητις Ὀδυσσεύς·
care not, so long as my lady, the constant Penelope, lives in the hall, and godlike Telemachus.” Then wise Telemachus answered him: “Be silent: do not, I bid thee, answer yonder man with many words, for Antinous is wont ever in evil wise to provoke to anger	ὦ γύναι, οὔ πως ἔστιν ὑποκρίνασθαι ὄνειρον ἄλλῃ ἀποκλίναντʼ, ἐπεὶ ἦ ῥά τοι αὐτὸς Ὀδυσσεὺς πέφραδʼ ὅπως τελέει· μνηστῆρσι δὲ φαίνετʼ ὄλεθρος πᾶσι μάλʼ, οὐδέ κέ τις θάνατον καὶ κῆρας ἀλύξει. τὸν δʼ αὖτε προσέειπε περίφρων Πηνελόπεια·
with harsh words, aye, and urges on the others too.” With this he spoke winged words to Antinous: “Antinous, truly thou carest well for me, as a father for his son, seeing that thou biddest me drive yonder stranger from the hall with a word of compulsion. May the god never bring such a thing to pass.	ξεῖνʼ, ἦ τοι μὲν ὄνειροι ἀμήχανοι ἀκριτόμυθοι γίγνοντʼ, οὐδέ τι πάντα τελείεται ἀνθρώποισι. δοιαὶ γάρ τε πύλαι ἀμενηνῶν εἰσὶν ὀνείρων· αἱ μὲν γὰρ κεράεσσι τετεύχαται, αἱ δʼ ἐλέφαντι· τῶν οἳ μέν κʼ ἔλθωσι διὰ πριστοῦ ἐλέφαντος,
Nay, take and give him somewhat: I begrudge it not, but rather myself bid thee give. In this matter regard not my mother, no, nor any of the slaves that are in the house of divine Odysseus. But verily far other is the thought in thy breast; for thou art far more fain thyself to eat than to give to another.”	οἵ ῥʼ ἐλεφαίρονται, ἔπεʼ ἀκράαντα φέροντες· οἱ δὲ διὰ ξεστῶν κεράων ἔλθωσι θύραζε, οἵ ῥʼ ἔτυμα κραίνουσι, βροτῶν ὅτε κέν τις ἴδηται. ἀλλʼ ἐμοὶ οὐκ ἐντεῦθεν ὀΐομαι αἰνὸν ὄνειρον ἐλθέμεν· ἦ κʼ ἀσπαστὸν ἐμοὶ καὶ παιδὶ γένοιτο.
Then Antinous answered him, and said: “Telemachus, thou braggart, unrestrained in daring, what a thing hast thou said! If all the wooers would but hand him as much as I, for full three months' space this house would keep him at a distance.” So he spoke, and seized the footstool	ἄλλο δέ τοι ἐρέω, σὺ δʼ ἐνὶ φρεσὶ βάλλεο σῇσιν· ἥδε δὴ ἠὼς εἶσι δυσώνυμος, ἥ μʼ Ὀδυσῆος οἴκου ἀποσχήσει· νῦν γὰρ καταθήσω ἄεθλον, τοὺς πελέκεας, τοὺς κεῖνος ἐνὶ μεγάροισιν ἑοῖσιν ἵστασχʼ ἑξείης, δρυόχους ὥς, δώδεκα πάντας·
on which he was wont to rest his shining feet as he feasted, and shewed it from beneath the table, where it lay. But all the rest gave gifts, and filled the wallet with bread and bits of meat. And now Odysseus was like to have gone back again to the threshold, and to have made trial of the Achaeans without cost, but he paused by Antinous, and spoke to him, saying:	στὰς δʼ ὅ γε πολλὸν ἄνευθε διαρρίπτασκεν ὀϊστόν. νῦν δὲ μνηστήρεσσιν ἄεθλον τοῦτον ἐφήσω· ὃς δέ κε ῥηΐτατʼ ἐντανύσῃ βιὸν ἐν παλάμῃσι καὶ διοϊστεύσῃ πελέκεων δυοκαίδεκα πάντων, τῷ κεν ἅμʼ ἑσποίμην, νοσφισσαμένη τόδε δῶμα
 “Friend, give me some gift; thou seemest not in my eyes to be the basest of the Achaeans, but rather the noblest, for thou art like a king. Therefore it is meet that thou shouldest give even a better portion of bread than the rest; so would I make thy fame known all over the boundless earth. For I too once dwelt in a house of my own among men,	κουρίδιον, μάλα καλόν, ἐνίπλειον βιότοιο· τοῦ ποτὲ μεμνήσεσθαι ὀΐομαι ἔν περ ὀνείρῳ. τὴν δʼ ἀπαμειβόμενος προσέφη πολύμητις Ὀδυσσεύς ὦ γύναι αἰδοίη Λαερτιάδεω Ὀδυσῆος, μηκέτι νῦν ἀνάβαλλε δόμοις ἔνι τοῦτον ἄεθλον·
a rich man in a wealthy house, and full often I gave gifts to a wanderer, whosoever he was and with whatsoever need he came. Slaves too I had past counting, and all other things in abundance whereby men live well and are reputed wealthy. But Zeus, son of Cronos, brought all to naught—so, I ween, was his good pleasure—	πρὶν γάρ τοι πολύμητις ἐλεύσεται ἐνθάδʼ Ὀδυσσεύς, πρὶν τούτους τόδε τόξον ἐΰξοον ἀμφαφόωντας νευρήν τʼ ἐντανύσαι διοϊστεῦσαί τε σιδήρου. τὸν δʼ αὖτε προσέειπε περίφρων Πηνελόπεια· εἴ κʼ ἐθέλοις μοι, ξεῖνε, παρήμενος ἐν μεγάροισι
who sent me forth with roaming pirates to go to Egypt , a far voyage, that I might meet my ruin; and in the river Aegyptus I moored my curved ships. Then verily I bade my trusty comrades to remain there by the ships and to guard the ships,	τέρπειν, οὔ κέ μοι ὕπνος ἐπὶ βλεφάροισι χυθείη. ἀλλʼ οὐ γάρ πως ἔστιν ἀΰπνους ἔμμεναι αἰεὶ ἀνθρώπους· ἐπὶ γάρ τοι ἑκάστῳ μοῖραν ἔθηκαν ἀθάνατοι θνητοῖσιν ἐπὶ ζείδωρον ἄρουραν. ἀλλʼ ἦ τοι μὲν ἐγὼν ὑπερώϊον εἰσαναβᾶσα
and I sent out scouts to go to places of outlook. But my comrades, yielding to wantonness and led on by their own might, straightway set about wasting the fair fields of the men of Egypt ; and they carried off the women and little children, and slew the men; and the cry came quickly to the city.	λέξομαι εἰς εὐνήν, ἥ μοι στονόεσσα τέτυκται, αἰεὶ δάκρυσʼ ἐμοῖσι πεφυρμένη, ἐξ οὗ Ὀδυσσεὺς ᾤχετʼ ἐποψόμενος Κακοΐλιον οὐκ ὀνομαστήν. ἔνθα κε λεξαίμην· σὺ δὲ λέξεο τῷδʼ ἐνὶ οἴκῳ, ἢ χαμάδις στορέσας ἤ τοι κατὰ δέμνια θέντων.
 Then, hearing the shouting, the people came forth at break of day, and the whole plain was filled with footmen and chariots and the flashing of bronze. And Zeus, who hurls the thunderbolt, cast an evil panic upon my comrades, and none had courage to take his stand and face the foe; for evil surrounded us on every side.	ὣς εἰποῦσʼ ἀνέβαινʼ ὑπερώϊα σιγαλόεντα, οὐκ οἴη, ἅμα τῇ γε καὶ ἀμφίπολοι κίον ἄλλαι. ἐς δʼ ὑπερῷʼ ἀναβᾶσα σὺν ἀμφιπόλοισι γυναιξὶ κλαῖεν ἔπειτʼ Ὀδυσῆα, φίλον πόσιν, ὄφρα οἱ ὕπνον ἡδὺν ἐπὶ βλεφάροισι βάλε γλαυκῶπις Ἀθήνη.
Then Antinous answered him, and said: “What god has brought this bane hither to trouble our feast? Stand off yonder in the midst, away from my table, lest thou come presently to a bitter Egypt and a bitter Cyprus , seeing that thou art a bold and shameless beggar.	αὐτὰρ ὁ ἐν προδόμῳ εὐνάζετο δῖος Ὀδυσσεύς· κὰμ μὲν ἀδέψητον βοέην στόρεσʼ, αὐτὰρ ὕπερθε κώεα πόλλʼ ὀΐων, τοὺς ἱρεύεσκον Ἀχαιοί· Εὐρυνόμη δʼ ἄρʼ ἐπὶ χλαῖναν βάλε κοιμηθέντι.
Thou comest up to every man in turn, and they give recklessly; for there is no restraint or scruple in giving freely of another's goods, since each man has plenty beside him.” Then Odysseus of many wiles drew back, and said to him: “Lo, now, it seems that thou at least hast not wits to match thy beauty.	ἔνθʼ Ὀδυσεὺς μνηστῆρσι κακὰ φρονέων ἐνὶ θυμῷ κεῖτʼ ἐγρηγορόων· ταὶ δʼ ἐκ μεγάροιο γυναῖκες ἤϊσαν, αἳ μνηστῆρσιν ἐμισγέσκοντο πάρος περ, ἀλλήλῃσι γέλω τε καὶ εὐφροσύνην παρέχουσαι. τοῦ δʼ ὠρίνετο θυμὸς ἐνὶ στήθεσσι φίλοισι·
Thou wouldest not out of thine own substance give even a grain of salt to thy suppliant, thou who now, when sitting at another's table, hadst not the heart to take of the bread and give me aught. Yet here lies plenty at thy hand.” So he spoke, and Antinous waxed the more wroth at heart, and with an angry glance from beneath his brows spoke to him winged words:	πολλὰ δὲ μερμήριζε κατὰ φρένα καὶ κατὰ θυμόν, ἠὲ μεταΐξας θάνατον τεύξειεν ἑκάστῃ, ἦ ἔτʼ ἐῷ μνηστῆρσιν ὑπερφιάλοισι μιγῆναι ὕστατα καὶ πύματα, κραδίη δέ οἱ ἔνδον ὑλάκτει. ὡς δὲ κύων ἀμαλῇσι περὶ σκυλάκεσσι βεβῶσα
“Now verily, methinks, thou shalt no more go forth from the hall in seemly fashion, since thou dost even utter words of reviling.” So saying, he seized the footstool and flung it, and struck Odysseus on the base of the right shoulder, where it joins the back. But he stood firm as a rock, nor did the missile of Antinous make him reel;	ἄνδρʼ ἀγνοιήσασʼ ὑλάει μέμονέν τε μάχεσθαι, ὥς ῥα τοῦ ἔνδον ὑλάκτει ἀγαιομένου κακὰ ἔργα· στῆθος δὲ πλήξας κραδίην ἠνίπαπε μύθῳ· τέτλαθι δή, κραδίη· καὶ κύντερον ἄλλο ποτʼ ἔτλης. ἤματι τῷ ὅτε μοι μένος ἄσχετος ἤσθιε Κύκλωψ
but he shook his head in silence, pondering evil in the deep of his heart. Then back to the threshold he went and sat down, and down he laid his well-filled wallet; and he spoke among the wooers: “Hear me, wooers of the glorious queen, that I may say what the heart in my breast bids me.	ἰφθίμους ἑτάρους· σὺ δʼ ἐτόλμας, ὄφρα σε μῆτις ἐξάγαγʼ ἐξ ἄντροιο ὀϊόμενον θανέεσθαι. ὣς ἔφατʼ, ἐν στήθεσσι καθαπτόμενος φίλον ἦτορ· τῷ δὲ μάλʼ ἐν πείσῃ κραδίη μένε τετληυῖα νωλεμέως· ἀτὰρ αὐτὸς ἑλίσσετο ἔνθα καὶ ἔνθα.
 Verily there is no pain of heart nor any grief when a man is smitten while fighting for his own possessions, whether for his cattle or for his white sheep; but Antinous has smitten me for my wretched belly's sake, an accursed plague that brings many evils upon men.	ὡς δʼ ὅτε γαστέρʼ ἀνὴρ πολέος πυρὸς αἰθομένοιο, ἐμπλείην κνίσης τε καὶ αἵματος, ἔνθα καὶ ἔνθα αἰόλλῃ, μάλα δʼ ὦκα λιλαίεται ὀπτηθῆναι, ὣς ἄρʼ ὅ γʼ ἔνθα καὶ ἔνθα ἑλίσσετο, μερμηρίζων ὅππως δὴ μνηστῆρσιν ἀναιδέσι χεῖρας ἐφήσει
Ah, if for beggars there are gods and avengers, may the doom of death come upon Antinous before his marriage.” Then Antinous, son of Eupeithes, answered him: “Sit still, and eat, stranger, or go elsewhere; lest the young men drag thee	μοῦνος ἐὼν πολέσι. σχεδόθεν δέ οἱ ἦλθεν Ἀθήνη οὐρανόθεν καταβᾶσα· δέμας δʼ ἤϊκτο γυναικί· στῆ δʼ ἄρʼ ὑπὲρ κεφαλῆς καί μιν πρὸς μῦθον ἔειπε· τίπτʼ αὖτʼ ἐγρήσσεις, πάντων περὶ κάμμορε φωτῶν; οἶκος μέν τοι ὅδʼ ἐστί, γυνὴ δέ τοι ἥδʼ ἐνὶ οἴκῳ
by hand or foot through the house for words like these, and strip off all thy skin.” So he spoke, but they all were filled with exceeding indignation, and thus would one of the proud youths speak: “Antinous, thou didst not well to strike the wretched wanderer. Doomed man that thou art, what if haply he be some god come down from heaven!	καὶ, πάϊς, οἷόν πού τις ἐέλδεται ἔμμεναι υἷα. τὴν δʼ ἀπαμειβόμενος προσέφη πολύμητις Ὀδυσσεύς· ναὶ δὴ ταῦτά γε πάντα, θεά, κατὰ μοῖραν ἔειπες· ἀλλά τί μοι τόδε θυμὸς ἐνὶ φρεσὶ μερμηρίζει, ὅππως δὴ μνηστῆρσιν ἀναιδέσι χεῖρας ἐφήσω,
Aye, and the gods in the guise of strangers from afar put on all manner of shapes, and visit the cities, beholding the violence and the righteousness of men.” So spoke the wooers, but Antinous paid no heed to their words. And Telemachus nursed in his heart great grief	μοῦνος ἐών· οἱ δʼ αἰὲν ἀολλέες ἔνδον ἔασι. πρὸς δʼ ἔτι καὶ τόδε μεῖζον ἐνὶ φρεσὶ μερμηρίζω· εἴ περ γὰρ κτείναιμι Διός τε σέθεν τε ἕκητι, πῆ κεν ὑπεκπροφύγοιμι; τά σε φράζεσθαι ἄνωγα. τὸν δʼ αὖτε προσέειπε θεὰ γλαυκῶπις Ἀθήνη·
for the smiting, though he let no tear fall from his eyelids to the ground; but he shook his head in silence, pondering evil in the deep of his heart. Howbeit when wise Penelope heard of the man's being smitten in the hall, she spoke among her handmaids, and said: “Even so may thine own self be smitten by the famed archer Apollo.”	σχέτλιε, καὶ μέν τίς τε χερείονι πείθεθʼ ἑταίρῳ, ὅς περ θνητός τʼ ἐστὶ καὶ οὐ τόσα μήδεα οἶδεν· αὐτὰρ ἐγὼ θεός εἰμι, διαμπερὲς ἥ σε φυλάσσω ἐν πάντεσσι πόνοις. ἐρέω δέ τοι ἐξαναφανδόν· εἴ περ πεντήκοντα λόχοι μερόπων ἀνθρώπων
And again the housewife Eurynome said to her: “Would that fulfillment might be granted to our prayers. So should not one of these men come to the fair-throned Dawn.” And wise Penelope answered her: “Nurse, enemies are they all, for they devise evil.	νῶϊ περισταῖεν, κτεῖναι μεμαῶτες Ἄρηϊ, καί κεν τῶν ἐλάσαιο βόας καὶ ἴφια μῆλα. ἀλλʼ ἑλέτω σε καὶ ὕπνος· ἀνίη καὶ τὸ φυλάσσειν πάννυχον ἐγρήσσοντα, κακῶν δʼ ὑποδύσεαι ἤδη. ὣς φάτο, καί ῥά οἱ ὕπνον ἐπὶ βλεφάροισιν ἔχευεν,
But Antinous more than all is like black fate. Some wretched stranger roams through the house, begging alms of the men, for want compels him, and all the others filled his wallet and gave him gifts, but Antinous flung a footstool and smote him at the base of the right shoulder.”	αὐτὴ δʼ ἂψ ἐς Ὄλυμπον ἀφίκετο δῖα θεάων. εὖτε τὸν ὕπνος ἔμαρπτε, λύων μελεδήματα θυμοῦ, λυσιμελής, ἄλοχος δʼ ἄρʼ ἐπέγρετο κεδνὰ ἰδυῖα· κλαῖε δʼ ἄρʼ ἐν λέκτροισι καθεζομένη μαλακοῖσιν. αὐτὰρ ἐπεὶ κλαίουσα κορέσσατο ὃν κατὰ θυμόν,
So she spoke among her handmaids, sitting in her chamber, while goodly Odysseus was at meat. Then she called to her the goodly swineherd, and said: “Go, goodly Eumaeus, and bid the stranger come hither, that I may give him greeting, and ask him	Ἀρτέμιδι πρώτιστον ἐπεύξατο δῖα γυναικῶν· Ἄρτεμι, πότνα θεά, θύγατερ Διός, αἴθε μοι ἤδη ἰὸν ἐνὶ στήθεσσι βαλοῦσʼ ἐκ θυμὸν ἕλοιο αὐτίκα νῦν, ἢ ἔπειτα μʼ ἀναρπάξασα θύελλα οἴχοιτο προφέρουσα κατʼ ἠερόεντα κέλευθα,
if haply he has heard of Odysseus of the steadfast heart, or has seen him with his eyes. He seems like one that has wandered far.” To her, then, swineherd Eumaeus, didst thou make answer, and say: “I would, O queen, that the Achaeans would keep silence, for he speaks such words as would charm thy very soul.	ἐν προχοῇς δὲ βάλοι ἀψορρόου Ὠκεανοῖο. ὡς δʼ ὅτε Πανδαρέου κούρας ἀνέλοντο θύελλαι· τῇσι τοκῆας μὲν φθῖσαν θεοί, αἱ δʼ ἐλίποντο ὀρφαναὶ ἐν μεγάροισι, κόμισσε δὲ δῖʼ Ἀφροδίτη τυρῷ καὶ μέλιτι γλυκερῷ καὶ ἡδέϊ οἴνῳ·
 Three nights I had him by me, and three days I kept him in my hut, for to me first he came when he fled by stealth from a ship, but he had not yet ended the tale of his sufferings. Even as when a man gazes upon a minstrel who sings to mortals songs of longing that the gods have taught him,	Ἥρη δʼ αὐτῇσιν περὶ πασέων δῶκε γυναικῶν εἶδος καὶ πινυτήν, μῆκος δʼ ἔπορʼ Ἄρτεμις ἁγνή, ἔργα δʼ Ἀθηναίη δέδαε κλυτὰ ἐργάζεσθαι. εὖτʼ Ἀφροδίτη δῖα προσέστιχε μακρὸν Ὄλυμπον, κούρῃς αἰτήσουσα τέλος θαλεροῖο γάμοιο—
and their desire to hear him has no end, whensoever he sings, even so he charmed me as he sat in my hall. He says that he is an ancestral friend of Odysseus, and that he dwells in Crete , where is the race of Minos. From thence has he now come on this journey hither, ever suffering woes	ἐς Δία τερπικέραυνον, ὁ γάρ τʼ εὖ οἶδεν ἅπαντα, μοῖράν τʼ ἀμμορίην τε καταθνητῶν ἀνθρώπων— τόφρα δὲ τὰς κούρας ἅρπυιαι ἀνηρείψαντο καί ῥʼ ἔδοσαν στυγερῇσιν ἐρινύσιν ἀμφιπολεύειν· ὣς ἔμʼ ἀϊστώσειαν Ὀλύμπια δώματʼ ἔχοντες,
as he wanders on and on. And he insists that he has heard tidings of Odysseus, near at hand in the rich land of the Thesprotians and yet alive; and he is bringing many treasures to his home.” Then wise Penelope answered him: “Go, call him hither, that he may himself tell me to my face.	ἠέ μʼ ἐϋπλόκαμος βάλοι Ἄρτεμις, ὄφρʼ Ὀδυσῆα ὀσσομένη καὶ γαῖαν ὕπο στυγερὴν ἀφικοίμην, μηδέ τι χείρονος ἀνδρὸς ἐϋφραίνοιμι νόημα. ἀλλὰ τὸ μὲν καὶ ἀνεκτὸν ἔχει κακόν, ὁππότε κέν τις ἤματα μὲν κλαίῃ, πυκινῶς ἀκαχήμενος ἦτορ,
But as for these men, let them make sport as they sit in the doorway or here in the house, since their hearts are merry. For their own possessions lie untouched in their homes, bread and sweet wine, and on these do their servants feed. But themselves throng our house day after day, slaying our oxen, and sheep, and fat goats, and keep revel and drink the flaming wine recklessly, and havoc is made of all this wealth, for there is no man here such as Odysseus was to keep ruin from the house. But if Odysseus should come and return to his native land, straightway would he with his son take vengeance on these men for their violent deeds.” So she spoke, and Telemachus sneezed loudly, and all the room round about echoed wondrously. And Penelope laughed, and straightway spoke to Eumaeus winged words: “Go, pray, call the stranger here before me. Dost thou not note that my son has sneezed at all my words. Therefore shall utter death fall upon the wooers one and all, nor shall one of them escape death and the fates. And another thing will I tell thee, and do thou lay it to heart. If I find that he speaks all things truly, I will clothe him in a cloak and tunic, fair raiment.” So she spoke, and the swineherd went when he had heard this saying; and coming up to Odysseus he spoke to him winged words: “Sir stranger, wise Penelope calls for thee, the mother of Telemachus, and her heart bids her make enquiry about her husband, though she has suffered many woes. And if she finds that thou speakest all things truly, she will clothe thee in a cloak and tunic, which thou needest most of all. As for thy food, thou shalt beg it through the land, and feed thy belly, and whoso will shall give it thee.” Then the much-enduring goodly Odysseus answered him: “Eumaeus, soon will I tell all the truth to the daughter of Icarius, wise Penelope. For well do I know of Odysseus, and in common have we borne affliction. But I have fear of this throng of harsh wooers, whose wantonness and violence reach the iron heaven. For even now, when, as I was going through the hall doing no evil, this man struck me and hurt me, neither Telemachus nor any other did aught to ward off the blow. Wherefore now bid Penelope	νύκτας δʼ ὕπνος ἔχῃσιν—ὁ γάρ τʼ ἐπέλησεν ἁπάντων, ἐσθλῶν ἠδὲ κακῶν, ἐπεὶ ἄρ βλέφαρʼ ἀμφικαλύψῃ— αὐτὰρ ἐμοὶ καὶ ὀνείρατʼ ἐπέσσευεν κακὰ δαίμων. τῇδε γὰρ αὖ μοι νυκτὶ παρέδραθεν εἴκελος αὐτῷ, τοῖος ἐὼν οἷος ᾖεν ἅμα στρατῷ· αὐτὰρ ἐμὸν κῆρ
to wait in the halls, eager though she be, till set of sun; and then let her ask me of her husband regarding the day of his return, giving me a seat nearer the fire, for lo, the raiment that I wear is mean, and this thou knowest of thyself, for to thee first did I make my prayer.” So he spoke, and the swineherd went when he had heard this saying.	χαῖρʼ, ἐπεὶ οὐκ ἐφάμην ὄναρ ἔμμεναι, ἀλλʼ ὕπαρ ἤδη. ὣς ἔφατʼ, αὐτίκα δὲ χρυσόθρονος ἤλυθεν Ἠώς. τῆς δʼ ἄρα κλαιούσης ὄπα σύνθετο δῖος Ὀδυσσεύς· μερμήριζε δʼ ἔπειτα, δόκησε δέ οἱ κατὰ θυμὸν ἤδη γιγνώσκουσα παρεστάμεναι κεφαλῆφι.
And as he passed over the threshold Penelope said to him: “Thou dost not bring him, Eumaeus. What does the wanderer mean by this? Does he fear some one beyond measure, or does he idly feel ashamed in the house? 'Tis ill for a beggar to feel shame.” To her, then, swineherd Eumaeus, didst thou make answer and say:	χλαῖναν μὲν συνελὼν καὶ κώεα, τοῖσιν ἐνεῦδεν, ἐς μέγαρον κατέθηκεν ἐπὶ θρόνου, ἐκ δὲ βοείην θῆκε θύραζε φέρων, Διὶ δʼ εὔξατο χεῖρας ἀνασχών· Ζεῦ πάτερ, εἴ μʼ ἐθέλοντες ἐπὶ τραφερήν τε καὶ ὑγρὴν ἤγετʼ ἐμὴν ἐς γαῖαν, ἐπεί μʼ ἐκακώσατε λίην,
“He speaks rightly, even as any other man would deem, in seeking to shun the insolence of overweening men. But he bids thee to wait till set of sun. And for thyself, too, it is far more seemly, O queen, to speak to the stranger alone, and to hear his words.”	φήμην τίς μοι φάσθω ἐγειρομένων ἀνθρώπων ἔνδοθεν, ἔκτοσθεν δὲ Διὸς τέρας ἄλλο φανήτω. ὣς ἔφατʼ εὐχόμενος· τοῦ δʼ ἔκλυε μητίετα Ζεύς, αὐτίκα δʼ ἐβρόντησεν ἀπʼ αἰγλήεντος Ὀλύμπου, ὑψόθεν ἐκ νεφέων· γήθησε δὲ δῖος Ὀδυσσεύς.
Then wise Penelope answered him: “Not without wisdom is the stranger; he divines how it may be. There are no mortal men, methinks, who in wantonness devise such wicked folly as these.” So she spoke, and the goodly swineherd departed	φήμην δʼ ἐξ οἴκοιο γυνὴ προέηκεν ἀλετρὶς πλησίον, ἔνθʼ ἄρα οἱ μύλαι ἥατο ποιμένι λαῶν, τῇσιν δώδεκα πᾶσαι ἐπερρώοντο γυναῖκες ἄλφιτα τεύχουσαι καὶ ἀλείατα, μυελὸν ἀνδρῶν. αἱ μὲν ἄρʼ ἄλλαι εὗδον, ἐπεὶ κατὰ πυρὸν ἄλεσσαν,
into the throng of the wooers when he had told her all. And straightway he spoke winged words to Telemachus, holding his head close to him that the others might not hear: “Friend, I am going forth to guard the swine and all things there, thy livelihood and mine; but have thou charge of all things here.	ἡ δὲ μίʼ οὔπω παύετʼ, ἀφαυροτάτη δʼ ἐτέτυκτο· ἥ ῥα μύλην στήσασα ἔπος φάτο, σῆμα ἄνακτι· Ζεῦ πάτερ, ὅς τε θεοῖσι καὶ ἀνθρώποισιν ἀνάσσεις, ἦ μεγάλʼ ἐβρόντησας ἀπʼ οὐρανοῦ ἀστερόεντος, οὐδέ ποθι νέφος ἐστί· τέρας νύ τεῳ τόδε φαίνεις.
Thine own self do thou keep safe first of all, and let thy mind beware lest some ill befall thee, for many of the Achaeans are devising evil, whom may Zeus utterly destroy before harm fall on us.” Then wise Telemachus answered him: “So shall it be, father; go thy way when thou hast supped.	κρῆνον νῦν καὶ ἐμοὶ δειλῇ ἔπος, ὅττι κεν εἴπω· μνηστῆρες πύματόν τε καὶ ὕστατον ἤματι τῷδε ἐν μεγάροις Ὀδυσῆος ἑλοίατο δαῖτʼ ἐρατεινήν, οἳ δή μοι καμάτῳ θυμαλγέι· γούνατʼ ἔλυσαν ἄλφιτα τευχούσῃ· νῦν ὕστατα δειπνήσειαν.
And in the morning do thou come and bring goodly victims. But all matters here shall be a care to me and to the immortals.” So he spoke, and the swineherd sat down again on the polished chair. But when he had satisfied his heart with meat and drink, he went his way to the swine, and left the courts and the hall	ὣς ἄρʼ ἔφη, χαῖρεν δὲ κλεηδόνι δῖος Ὀδυσσεὺς Ζηνός τε βροντῇ· φάτο γὰρ τίσασθαι ἀλείτας. αἱ δʼ ἄλλαι δμῳαὶ κατὰ δώματα κάλʼ Ὀδυσῆος ἀγρόμεναι ἀνέκαιον ἐπʼ ἐσχάρῃ ἀκάματον πῦρ. Τηλέμαχος δʼ εὐνῆθεν ἀνίστατο, ἰσόθεος φώς,
 full of banqueters. And they were making merry with dance and song, for evening had now come on.	εἵματα ἑσσάμενος· περὶ δὲ ξίφος ὀξὺ θέτʼ ὤμῳ· ποσσὶ δʼ ὑπὸ λιπαροῖσιν ἐδήσατο καλὰ πέδιλα, εἵλετο δʼ ἄλκιμον ἔγχος, ἀκαχμένον ὀξέι· χαλκῷ· στῆ δʼ ἄρʼ ἐπʼ οὐδὸν ἰών, πρὸς δʼ Εὐρύκλειαν ἔειπε· μαῖα φίλη, τὸν ξεῖνον ἐτιμήσασθʼ ἐνὶ οἴκῳ
Now there came up a public beggar who was wont to beg through the town of Ithaca , and was known for his greedy belly, eating and drinking without end. No strength had he nor might, but in bulk was big indeed to look upon. Arnaeus was his name, for this name his honored mother had given him at his birth; but Irus all the young men called him, because he used to run on errands when anyone bade him. He came now, and was for driving Odysseus from his own house; and he began to revile him, and spoke winged words: “Give way, old man, from the doorway, lest soon thou be even dragged out by the foot. Dost thou not see that all men are winking at me, and bidding me drag thee? Yet for myself, I am ashamed to do it. Nay, up with thee, lest our quarrel even come to blows.” Then with an angry glance from beneath his brows Odysseus of many wiles answered him: “Good fellow, I harm thee not in deed or word, nor do I begrudge that any man should give thee, though the portion he took up were a large one. This threshold will hold us both, and thou hast no need to be jealous for the goods of other folk. Thou seemest to me to be a vagrant, even as I am; and as for happy fortune, it is the gods that are like to give us that. But with thy fists do not provoke me overmuch, lest thou anger me, and, old man though I am, I befoul thy breast and lips with blood. So should I have the greater peace tomorrow, for I deem not that thou shalt return a second time to the hall of Odysseus, son of Laertes.” Then, waxing wroth, the vagrant Irus said to him: “Now see how glibly the filthy wretch talks, like an old kitchen-wife. But I will devise evil for him, smiting him left and right, and will scatter on the ground all the teeth from his jaws, as though he were a swine wasting the corn. Gird thyself now, that these men, too, may all know our fighting. But how couldst thou fight with a younger man?” Thus on the polished threshold before the lofty doors they stirred one another's rage right heartily. And the strong and mighty Antinous heard the two, and, breaking into a merry laugh, he spoke among the wooers: “Friends, never before has such a thing come to pass, that a god has brought sport like this to this house. Yon stranger and Irus are provoking one another to blows. Come, let us quickly set them on.” So he spoke, and they all sprang up laughing and gathered about the tattered beggars. And Antinous, son of Eupeithes, spoke among them, and said: “Hear me, ye proud wooers, that I may say somewhat. Here at the fire are goats' paunches lying, which we set there for supper, when we had filled them with fat and blood. Now whichever of the two wins and proves himself the better man, let him rise and choose for himself which one of these he will. And furthermore he shall always feast with us, nor will we suffer any other beggar to join our company and beg of us.” So spoke Antinous, and his word was pleasing to them. Then with crafty mind Odysseus of many wiles spoke among them: “Friends, in no wise may an old man that is overcome with woe fight with a younger. Howbeit my belly, that worker of evil, urges me on, that I may be overcome by his blows. But come now, do you all swear to me a mighty oath, to the end that no man, doing a favour to Irus, may deal me a foul blow with heavy hand, and so by violence subdue me to this fellow.” So he spoke, and they all gave the oath not to smite him, even as he bade. But when they had sworn and made an end of the oath, among them spoke again the strong and mighty Telemachus: “Stranger, if thy heart and thy proud spirit bid thee beat off this fellow, then fear not thou any man of all the Achaeans, for whoso strikes thee shall have to fight with more than thou. Thy host am I, and the princes assent hereto, Antinous and Eurymachus, men of prudence both.” So he spoke, and they all praised his words. But Odysseus girded his rags about his loins and showed his thighs, comely and great, and his broad shoulders came to view, and his chest and mighty arms. And Athena drew nigh and made greater the limbs of the shepherd of the people. Then all the wooers marvelled exceedingly, and thus would one speak with a glance at his neighbor: “Right soon shall Irus, un-Irused, have a bane of his own bringing, such a thigh does yon old man show from beneath his rags.” So they spoke, and the mind of Irus was miserably shaken; yet even so the serving men girded him, and led him out perforce all filled with dread, and his flesh trembled on his limbs. Then Antinous rated him and spoke, and addressed him: “Better were it now, thou braggart, that thou wert not living, nor hadst ever been born, if thou quailest and art so terribly afraid of this fellow—a man that is old and overcome by the woe that has come upon him. But I will speak out to thee, and this word shall verily be brought to pass. If this fellow conquers thee and proves the better man, I will fling thee into a black ship and send thee to the mainland to King Echetus, the maimer of all men, who will cut off thy nose and ears with the pitiless bronze, and will draw forth thy vitals and give them raw to dogs to rend.” So he spoke, and thereat yet greater trembling seized the other's limbs, and they led him into the ring and both men put up their hands. Then the much-enduring, goodly Odysseus was divided in mind whether he should strike him so that life should leave him even there as he fell, or whether he should deal him a light blow and stretch him on the earth. And, as he pondered, this seemed to him the better course, to deal him a light blow, that the Achaeans might not take note of him. Then verily, when they had put up their hands, Irus let drive at the right shoulder, but Odysseus smote him on the neck beneath the ear and crushed in the bones, and straightway the red blood ran forth from his mouth, and down he fell in the dust with a moan, and he gnashed his teeth, kicking the ground with his feet. But the lordly wooers raised their hands, and were like to die with laughter. Then Odysseus seized him by the foot, and dragged him forth through the doorway until he came to the court and the gates of the portico. And he set him down and leaned him against the wall of the court, and thrust his staff into his hand and spoke, and addressed him with winged words: “Sit there now, and scare off swine and dogs, and do not thou be lord of strangers and beggars, miserable that thou art, lest haply thou meet with some worse thing to profit withal.” He spoke, and flung about his shoulders his miserable wallet, full of holes, and slung by a twisted cord. Then back to the threshold he went and sat down; and the wooers went within, laughing merrily, and they greeted him, saying: “May Zeus grant thee, stranger, and the other immortal gods what thou desirest most, and the dearest wish of thy heart, seeing that thou hast made this insatiate fellow to cease from begging in the land. For soon shall we take him to the mainland to King Echetus, the maimer of all men.” So they spoke, and goodly Odysseus was glad at the word of omen. And Antinous set before him the great paunch, filled with fat and blood, and Amphinomus took up two loaves from the basket and set them before him, and pledged him in a cup of gold, and said: “Hail, Sir stranger; may happy fortune be thine in time to come, though now thou art the thrall of many sorrows.” Then Odysseus of many wiles answered him, and said: “Amphinomus, verily thou seemest to me to be a man of prudence; and such a man, too, was thy father, for I have heard of his fair fame, that Nisus of Dulichium was a brave man and a wealthy. From him, they say, thou art sprung, and thou seemest a man soft of speech. Wherefore I will tell thee, and do thou give heed and hearken. Nothing feebler does earth nurture than man, of all things that on earth are breathing and moving. For he thinks that he will never suffer evil in time to come, so long as the gods give him prosperity and his knees are quick; but when again the blessed gods decree him sorrow, this too he bears in sore despite with steadfast heart; for the spirit of men upon the earth is even such as the day which the father of gods and men brings upon them. For I, too, was once like to be prosperous among men, but many deeds of wantonness I wrought, yielding to my might and my strength, and trusting in my father and my brethren. Wherefore let no man soever be lawless at any time, but let him keep in silence whatever gifts the gods give. Aye, for I see the wooers devising wantonness, wasting the wealth and dishonoring the wife of a man who, I tell thee, will not long be away from his friends and his native land; nay, he is very near. But may some god lead thee forth hence to thy home, and mayest thou not meet him when he comes home to his dear native land. For not without bloodshed, methinks, will the wooers and he part one from the other when once he comes beneath his roof.” So he spoke, and pouring a libation, drank of the honey-sweet wine, and then gave back the cup into the hands of the marshaller of the people. But Amphinomus went through the hall with a heavy heart, bowing his head; for his spirit boded bane. Yet even so he did not escape his fate, but him, too, did Athena set in bonds so that he might be slain outright at the hands of Telemachus and by his spear. So he sat down again on the chair from which he had risen. Then the goddess, flashing-eyed Athena, put it in the heart of the daughter of Icarius, wise Penelope, to show herself to the wooers, that she might set their hearts a-flutter and win greater honor from her husband and her son than heretofore. Then she laughed a meaningless laugh and spoke, and addressed the nurse: “Eurynome, my heart longs, though it has never longed before, to show myself to the wooers, hateful though they are. Also I would say a word to my son that will be for his profit, namely, that he should not consort ever with the overweening wooers, who speak him fair but have evil plans thereafter.” Then the housewife, Eurynome, spoke to her and said: “Aye, verily, child, all this hast thou spoken aright. Go, then, reveal thy word to thy son and hide it not; but first wash thy body and anoint thy face, and go not as thou art with both cheeks stained with tears. Go, for it is ill to grieve ever without ceasing. For now, behold, thy son is of such an age, and it has been thy dearest prayer to the immortals to see him a bearded man.” Then wise Penelope answered her again: “Eurynome, beguile me not thus in thy love to wash my body and anoint me with oil. All beauty of mine have the gods, that hold Olympus , destroyed since the day when my lord departed in the hollow ships. But bid Autonoe and Hippodameia come to me, that they may stand by my side in the hall. Alone I will not go among men, for I am ashamed.” So she spoke, and the old woman went forth through the chamber to bear tidings to the women, and bid them come. Then again the goddess, flashing-eyed Athena, took other counsel. On the daughter of Icarius she shed sweet sleep, and she leaned back and slept there on her couch, and all her joints were relaxed. And meanwhile the fair goddess was giving her immortal gifts, that the Achaeans might marvel at her. With balm she first made fair her beautiful face, with balm ambrosial, such as that wherewith Cytherea, of the fair crown, anoints herself when she goes into the lovely dance of the Graces; and she made her taller, too, and statelier to behold, and made her whiter than new-sawn ivory. Now when she had done this the fair goddess departed, and the white-armed handmaids came forth from the chamber and drew near with sound of talking. Then sweet sleep released Penelope, and she rubbed her cheeks with her hands, and said: “Ah, in my utter wretchedness soft slumber enfolded me. Would that pure Artemis would even now give so soft a death, that I might no more waste my life away with sorrow at heart, longing for the manifold excellence of my dear husband, for that he was pre-eminent among the Achaeans.” So saying, she went down from the bright upper chamber, not alone, for two handmaids attended her. Now when the fair lady reached the wooers she stood by the doorpost of the well-built hall, holding before her face her shining veil; and a faithful handmaid stood on either side of her. Straightway then the knees of the wooers were loosened and their hearts enchanted with love, and they all prayed, each that he might lie by her side. But she spoke to Telemachus, her dear son: “Telemachus, thy mind and thy thoughts are no longer steadfast as heretofore. When thou wast but a child thou wast wont to revolve in thy mind thoughts more cunning; but now that thou art grown and hast reached the bounds of manhood, and wouldest be called a rich man's son by one who looked only to thy stature and thy comeliness, being himself a stranger from afar, thy mind and thy thoughts are no longer right as before. What a thing is this that has been done in these halls, that thou hast suffered yon stranger to be so maltreated! How now, if the stranger, while sitting thus in our house, should come to some harm through grievous mishandling? On thee, then, would fall shame and disgrace among men.” Then wise Telemachus answered her: “My mother, in this matter I take it not ill that thou art filled with anger. Yet of myself I know in my heart and understand each thing, the good and the evil, whereas heretofore I was but a child. But I am not able to plan all things wisely, for these men here thwart my will, keeping by me, one on this side and one on that, with evil purpose, and I have none to help me. Howbeit, I can tell thee, this battle between the stranger and Irus fell not out according to the mind of the wooers, but the stranger proved the better man. I would, O father Zeus, and Athena, and Apollo, that even now the wooers were thus subdued in our halls, and were hanging their heads, some in the court and some within the hall, and that each man's limbs were loosened, even as Irus now sits yonder by the gate of the court, hanging his head like a drunken man, and cannot stand erect upon his feet, or go home to whatsoever place he is wont to go, because his limbs are loosened.” Thus they spoke to one another. But Eurymachus addressed Penelope, and said: “Daughter of Icarius, wise Penelope, if all the Achaeans throughout Iasian Argos could see thee, even more wooers would be feasting in your halls from to-morrow on, for thou excellest all women in comeliness and stature, and in the wise heart within thee.” Then wise Penelope answered him: “Eurymachus, all excellence of mine, both of beauty and of form, the immortals destroyed on the day when the Argives embarked for Ilios , and with them went my husband Odysseus. If he might but come and watch over this life of mine, greater would be my fame and fairer. But now I am in sorrow, so many woes has some god brought upon me. Verily, when he went forth and left his native land, he clasped my right hand by the wrist, and said: “‘Wife, I deem not that the well-greaved Achaeans will all return from Troy safe and unscathed, for the Trojans, men say, are men of war, hurlers of the spear, and drawers of the bow, and drivers of swift horses, such as most quickly decide the great strife of equal war. Therefore I know not whether the god will bring me back, or whether I shall be cut off there in the land of Troy : so have thou charge of all things here. Be mindful of my father and my mother in the halls even as thou art now, or yet more, while I am far away. But when thou shalt see my son a bearded man, wed whom thou wilt, and leave thy house.’ “So he spoke, and now all this is being brought to pass. The night shall come when a hateful marriage shall fall to the lot of me accursed, whose happiness Zeus has taken away. But herein has bitter grief come upon my heart and soul, for such as yours was never the way of wooers heretofore. They who are fain to woo a lady of worth and the daughter of a rich man and vie with one another, these bring of themselves cattle and goodly flocks, a banquet for the friends of the bride, and give to her glorious gifts; but they do not devour the livelihood of another without atonement.” So she spoke, and the much-enduring, goodly Odysseus was glad, because she drew from them gifts, and beguiled their souls with gentle words, but her mind was set on other things. Then Antinous, son of Eupeithes, spoke to her again, and said: “Daughter of Icarius, wise Penelope, as for gifts, if any man of the Achaeans is minded to bring them hither, do thou take them; for it is not well to refuse a gift. But for us, we will go neither to our lands nor elsewhither, until thou weddest him whosoever is best of the Achaeans.” So spoke Antinous, and his word was pleasing to them, and each man sent forth a herald to bring his gifts. For Antinous he brought a large and beautiful robe, richly broidered, and in it were golden brooches, twelve in all, fitted with curved clasps. And a chain did another straightway bring to Eurymachus, one cunningly wrought of gold, strung with amber beads, bright as the sun. A pair of earrings his squires brought to Eurydamas, with three clustering drops, and great grace shone therefrom. And out of the house of lord Peisander, son of Polyctor, his squire brought a necklace, a jewel exceeding fair. So of the Achaeans one brought one fair gift and one another. But she thereafter, the fair lady, went up to her upper chamber, and her handmaids bare for her the beautiful gifts. But the wooers turned to dance and gladsome song, and made them merry, and waited for evening to come on. And as they made merry dark evening came upon them. Presently they set up three braziers in the hall to give them light, and round about them placed dry faggots, long since seasoned and hard, and newly split with the axe; and in the spaces between they set torches; and in turn the handmaids of Odysseus, of the steadfast heart, kindled the flame. Then Zeus-born Odysseus, of many wiles, himself spoke among the maids, and said: “Maidens of Odysseus, that has long been gone, go to the chambers where your honored queen abides, and twist the yarn by her side, and make glad her heart, as you sit in the chamber, or card the wool with your hands; but I will give light to all these men. For if they wish to wait for fair-throned Dawn, they shall in no wise outdo me. I am one that can endure much.” So he spoke, and the maids broke into a laugh, and glanced at one another. And fair-cheeked Melantho rated him shamefully, Melantho, whom Dolius begot, but whom Penelope had reared and cherished as her own child, and gave her playthings to her heart's desire. Yet even so she had at heart no sorrow for Penelope, but she loved Eurymachus and was wont to lie with him. She then rated Odysseus with reviling words: “Wretched stranger, thou art but a crack-brained fellow, unwilling to go to a smithy to sleep, or to a common lodge, but pratest here continually, unabashed in the company of many lords, and hast no fear at heart. Surely wine has mastered thy wits, or else thy mind is ever thus, that thou dost babble idly. Art thou beside thyself because thou hast beaten that vagrant Irus? Beware, lest presently another better than Irus shall rise up against thee to beat thee about the head with heavy hands, and befoul thee with streams of blood, and send thee forth from the house.” Then with an angry glance from beneath his brows Odysseus of many wiles answered her: “Presently shall I go yonder, thou shameless thing, and tell Telemachus, since thou speakest thus, that on the spot he may cut thee limb from limb.” So he spoke, and with his words scattered the women, who fled through the hall, and the limbs of each were loosened beneath her in terror, for they thought that he spoke truth. But Odysseus took his stand by the burning braziers to give light, and looked upon all the men. Yet other things was the heart within him pondering—things that were not to be unfulfilled. But Athena would in no wise suffer the proud wooers to abstain from bitter outrage, that pain might sink yet deeper into the heart of Odysseus, son of Laertes. So among them Eurymachus, son of Polybus, began to speak, jeering at Odysseus, and making mirth for his companions: “Hear me, wooers of the glorious queen, that I may say what the heart in my breast bids me. Not without the will of the gods has this man come to the palace of Odysseus; in any case there is a glare of torches from him— from his head, for there is no hair on it, no, not a trace.” Therewith he called to Odysseus, sacker of cities: “Stranger, wouldest thou have a mind to serve for hire, if I should take thee into service on an outlying farm—thy pay shall be assured thee—gathering stones for walls, and planting tall trees? There would I provide thee with food the year through, and clothe thee with raiment and give thee sandals for thy feet. But since thou hast learned only deeds of evil, thou wilt not care to busy thyself with work, but art minded rather to go skulking through the land, that thou mayest have wherewith to feed thy insatiate belly.” Then Odysseus of many wiles answered him, and said: “Eurymachus, I would that we two might have a match in working in the season of spring, when the long days come, at mowing the grass, I with a curved scythe in my hands and thou with another like it, and that the grass might be in plenty that so we might test our work, fasting till late evening. Or I would again that there were oxen to drive—the best there are, tawny and large, both well fed with grass, of like age and like power to bear the yoke, tireless in strength—and that there were a field of four acres, and the soil should yield before the plough: then shouldest thou see me, whether or no I could cut a straight furrow to the end. Or I would again that this day the son of Cronos might bring war upon us from whence he would, and I had a shield and two spears and a helmet all of bronze, that fitted well my temples: then shouldest thou see me mingling amid the foremost fighters, and wouldest not prate, taunting me with this belly of mine. But right insolent art thou, and thy heart is cruel, and forsooth thou thinkest thyself to be some great man and mighty, because thou consortest with few men and weak. If but Odysseus might return, and come to his native land, soon would yonder doors, right wide though they are, prove all too narrow for thee in thy flight out through the doorway.” So he spoke, and Eurymachus waxed the more wroth at heart, and with an angry glance from beneath his brows spoke to him winged words: “Wretch, presently will I work thee evil, that thou pratest thus, unabashed in the presence of many lords, and hast no fear at heart. Surely wine has mastered thy wits, or else thy mind is ever thus, that thou dost babble idly. Art thou beside thyself because thou hast beaten that vagrant Irus?” So saying, he seized a footstool, but Odysseus sat down at the knees of Amphinomus of Dulichium, in fear of Eurymachus. And so Eurymachus struck a cup-bearer on the right hand, and the wine-jug fell to the ground with a clang, and the bearer groaned, and fell backwards in the dust. Then the wooers broke into uproar throughout the shadowy halls, and thus would one man speak with a glance at his neighbor: “Would that yon stranger had perished elsewhere on his wanderings or ever he came hither; then should he never have brought among us all this tumult. But now we are brawling about beggars, nor shall there be any joy in our rich feast, since worse things prevail.” Then among them spoke the strong and mighty Telemachus: “Strange sirs, ye are mad, and no longer hide that ye have eaten and drunk; some god surely is moving you. Nay, now that you have well feasted, go to your homes and take your rest, when your spirits bid you. Yet do I drive no man forth.” So he spoke, and they all bit their lips, and marvelled at Telemachus, that he spoke boldly. But Amphinomus spoke, and addressed them—he was son of the noble prince Nisus, son of Aretias: “Friends, no man in answer to what has been fairly spoken would wax wroth and make reply with wrangling words. Abuse not any more this stranger nor any one of the slaves that are in the house of divine Odysseus. Nay, come, let the bearer pour drops for libation in the cups, that we may pour libations, and go home to take our rest. As for this stranger, let us leave him in the halls of Odysseus to be cared for by Telemachus; for to his house has he come.” So said he, and the words that he spoke were pleasing to all. Then a bowl was mixed for them by the lord Mulius, a herald from Dulichium, who was squire to Amphinomus. And he served out to all, coming up to each in turn; and they made libations to the blessed gods, and drank the honey-sweet wine. Then when they had made libations and had drunk to their heart's content, they went their way, each man to his own house, to take their rest.	εὐνῇ καὶ σίτῳ, ἦ αὔτως κεῖται ἀκηδής; τοιαύτη γὰρ ἐμὴ μήτηρ, πινυτή περ ἐοῦσα· ἐμπλήγδην ἕτερόν γε τίει μερόπων ἀνθρώπων χείρονα, τὸν δέ τʼ ἀρείονʼ ἀτιμήσασʼ ἀποπέμπει. τὸν δʼ αὖτε προσέειπε περίφρων Εὐρύκλεια·
So goodly Odysseus was left behind in the hall, planning with Athena's aid the slaying of the wooers, and he straightway spoke winged words to Telemachus: “Telemachus, the weapons of war thou must needs lay away within	αὐτὰρ ὅ γʼ, ὥς τις πάμπαν ὀϊζυρὸς καὶ ἄποτμος, οὐκ ἔθελʼ ἐν λέκτροισι καὶ ἐν ῥήγεσσι καθεύδειν, ἀλλʼ ἐν ἀδεψήτῳ βοέῃ καὶ κώεσιν οἰῶν ἔδραθʼ ἐνὶ προδόμῳ· χλαῖναν δʼ ἐπιέσσαμεν ἡμεῖς. ὣς φάτο, Τηλέμαχος δὲ διὲκ μεγάροιο βεβήκει
one and all, and when the wooers miss them and question thee, thou must beguile them with gentle words, saying: ‘Out of the smoke have I laid them, since they are no longer like those which of old Odysseus left behind him, when he went forth to Troy , but are all befouled, so far as the breath of fire has reached them.	ἔγχος ἔχων, ἅμα τῷ γε δύω κύνες ἀργοὶ ἕποντο. βῆ δʼ ἴμεν εἰς ἀγορὴν μετʼ ἐϋκνήμιδας Ἀχαιούς. ἡ δʼ αὖτε δμῳῇσιν ἐκέκλετο δῖα γυναικῶν, Εὐρύκλειʼ, Ὦπος θυγάτηρ Πεισηνορίδαο· ἀγρεῖθʼ, αἱ μὲν δῶμα κορήσατε ποιπνύσασαι,
 And furthermore this greater fear has a god put in my heart, lest haply, when heated with wine, you may set a quarrel afoot among you, and wound one another, and so bring shame on your feast and on your wooing. For of itself does the iron draw a man to it.’” So he spoke, and Telemachus hearkened to his dear father,	ῥάσσατέ τʼ, ἔν τε θρόνοις εὐποιήτοισι τάπητας βάλλετε πορφυρέους· αἱ δὲ σπόγγοισι τραπέζας πάσας ἀμφιμάσασθε, καθήρατε δὲ κρητῆρας καὶ δέπα ἀμφικύπελλα τετυγμένα· ταὶ δὲ μεθʼ ὕδωρ ἔρχεσθε κρήνηνδε, καὶ οἴσετε θᾶσσον ἰοῦσαι.
and calling forth the nurse Eurycleia, said to her: “Nurse, come now, I bid thee, shut up the women in their rooms, while I lay away in the store-room the weapons of my father, the goodly weapons which all uncared-for the smoke bedims in the hall since my father went forth, and I was still a child.	οὐ γὰρ δὴν μνηστῆρες ἀπέσσονται μεγάροιο, ἀλλὰ μάλʼ ἦρι νέονται, ἐπεὶ καὶ πᾶσιν ἑορτή. ὣς ἔφαθʼ, αἱ δʼ ἄρα τῆς μάλα μὲν κλύον ἠδʼ ἐπίθοντο. αἱ μὲν ἐείκοσι βῆσαν ἐπὶ κρήνην μελάνυδρον, αἱ δʼ αὐτοῦ κατὰ δώματʼ ἐπισταμένως πονέοντο.
But now I am minded to lay them away, where the breath of the fire will not come upon them.” Then the dear nurse Eurycleia answered him: “Aye, child, I would thou mightest ever take thought to care for the house and guard all its wealth. But come, who then shall fetch a light and bear it for thee,	ἐς δʼ ἦλθον δρηστῆρες Ἀχαιῶν. οἱ μὲν ἔπειτα εὖ καὶ ἐπισταμένως κέασαν ξύλα, ταὶ δὲ γυναῖκες ἦλθον ἀπὸ κρήνης· ἐπὶ δέ σφισιν ἦλθε συβώτης τρεῖς σιάλους κατάγων, οἳ ἔσαν μετὰ πᾶσιν ἄριστοι. καὶ τοὺς μέν ῥʼ εἴασε καθʼ ἕρκεα καλὰ νέμεσθαι,
since thou wouldest not suffer the maids, who might have given light, to go before thee?” Then wise Telemachus answered her; “This stranger here; for I will suffer no man to be idle who touches my portion of meal, even though he has come from afar.” So he spoke, but her word remained unwinged, and she locked the doors of the stately hall.	αὐτὸς δʼ αὖτʼ Ὀδυσῆα προσηύδα μειλιχίοισι· ξεῖνʼ, ἦ ἄρ τί σε μᾶλλον Ἀχαιοὶ εἰσορόωσιν, ἦέ σʼ ἀτιμάζουσι κατὰ μέγαρʼ, ὡς τὸ πάρος περ; τὸν δʼ ἀπαμειβόμενος προσέφη πολυμήτις Ὀδυσσεύς· αἲ γὰρ δή, Εὔμαιε, θεοὶ τισαίατο λώβην,
 Then the two sprang up, Odysseus and his glorious son, and set about bearing within the helmets and the bossy shields and the sharp-pointed spears; and before them Pallas Athena, bearing a golden lamp, made a most beauteous light.	ἣν οἵδʼ ὑβρίζοντες ἀτάσθαλα μηχανόωνται οἴκῳ ἐν ἀλλοτρίῳ, οὐδʼ αἰδοῦς μοῖραν ἔχουσιν. ὣς οἱ μὲν τοιαῦτα πρὸς ἀλλήλους ἀγόρευον, ἀγχίμολον δέ σφʼ ἦλθε Μελάνθιος, αἰπόλος αἰγῶν. αἶγας ἄγων αἳ πᾶσι μετέρεπον αἰπολίοισι,
Then Telemachus suddenly spoke to his father, and said: “Father, verily this is a great marvel that my eyes behold; certainly the walls of the house and the fair beams and cross-beams of fir and the pillars that reach on high, glow in my eyes as with the light of blazing fire.	δεῖπνον μνηστήρεσσι. δύω δʼ ἅμʼ ἕποντο νομῆες. καὶ τὰς μὲν κατέδησεν ὑπʼ αἰθούσῃ ἐριδούπῳ, αὐτὸς δʼ αὖτʼ Ὀδυσῆα προσηύδα κερτομίοισι· ξεῖνʼ, ἔτι καὶ νῦν ἐνθάδʼ ἀνιήσεις κατὰ δῶμα ἀνέρας αἰτίζων, ἀτὰρ οὐκ ἔξεισθα θύραζε;
Surely some god is within, one of those who hold broad heaven.” Then Odysseus of many wiles answered him, and said: “Hush, check thy thought, and ask no question; this, I tell thee, is the way of the gods that hold Olympus . But do thou go and take thy rest and I will remain behind here,	πάντως οὐκέτι νῶϊ διακρινέεσθαι ὀΐω πρὶν χειρῶν γεύσασθαι, ἐπεὶ σύ περ οὐ κατὰ κόσμον αἰτίζεις· εἰσὶν δὲ καὶ ἄλλαι δαῖτες Ἀχαιῶν. ὣς φάτο, τὸν δʼ οὔ τι προσέφη πολύμητις Ὀδυσσεύς, ἀλλʼ ἀκέων κίνησε κάρη, κακὰ βυσσοδομεύων.
that I may stir yet more the minds of the maids and of thy mother; and she with weeping shall ask me of each thing separately.” So he spoke, and Telemachus went forth through the hall by the light of blazing torches to go to his chamber to lie down, where he had heretofore been wont to rest, when sweet sleep came upon him.	τοῖσι δʼ ἐπὶ τρίτος ἦλθε Φιλοίτιος, ὄρχαμος ἀνδρῶν, βοῦν στεῖραν μνηστῆρσιν ἄγων καὶ πίονας αἶγας. πορθμῆες δʼ ἄρα τούς γε διήγαγον, οἵ τε καὶ ἄλλους ἀνθρώπους πέμπουσιν, ὅτις σφέας εἰσαφίκηται. καὶ τὰ μὲν εὖ κατέδησεν ὑπʼ αἰθούσῃ ἐριδούπῳ,
There now too he lay down and waited for the bright Dawn. But goodly Odysseus was left behind in the hall, planning with Athena's aid the slaying of the wooers. Then wise Penelope came forth from her chamber like unto Artemis or golden Aphrodite,	αὐτὸς δʼ αὖτʼ ἐρέεινε συβώτην ἄγχι παραστάς· τίς δὴ ὅδε ξεῖνος νέον εἰλήλουθε, συβῶτα, ἡμέτερον πρὸς δῶμα; τέων δʼ ἐξ εὔχεται εἶναι ἀνδρῶν; ποῦ δέ νύ οἱ γενεὴ καὶ πατρὶς ἄρουρα; δύσμορος, ἦ τε ἔοικε δέμας βασιλῆϊ ἄνακτι·
 and for her they set by the fire, where she was wont to sit, a chair inlaid with spirals of ivory and silver, which of old the craftsman Icmalius had made, and had set beneath it a foot-stool for the feet, that was part of the chair, and upon it a great fleece was wont to be laid. On this then wise Penelope sat down,	ἀλλὰ θεοὶ δυόωσι πολυπλάγκτους ἀνθρώπους, ὁππότε καὶ βασιλεῦσιν ἐπικλώσωνται ὀϊζύν. ἦ καὶ δεξιτερῇ δειδίσκετο χειρὶ παραστάς, καί μιν φωνήσας ἔπεα πτερόεντα προσηύδα· χαῖρε, πάτερ ὦ ξεῖνε· γένοιτό τοι ἔς περ ὀπίσσω
and the white-armed maids came forth from the women's hall. These began to take away the abundant food, the tables, and the cups from which the lordly men had been drinking, and they cast the embers from the braziers on to the floor, and piled upon the braziers fresh logs in abundance, to give light and warmth.	ὄλβος· ἀτὰρ μὲν νῦν γε κακοῖς ἔχεαι πολέεσσι. Ζεῦ πάτερ, οὔ τις σεῖο θεῶν ὀλοώτερος ἄλλος· οὐκ ἐλεαίρεις ἄνδρας, ἐπὴν δὴ γείνεαι αὐτός, μισγέμεναι κακότητι καὶ ἄλγεσι λευγαλέοισιν. ἴδιον, ὡς ἐνόησα, δεδάκρυνται δέ μοι ὄσσε
But Melantho began again a second time to rate Odysseus, saying: “Stranger, wilt thou even now still be a plague to us through the night, roaming through the house, and wilt thou spy upon the women? Nay, get thee forth, thou wretch, and be content with thy supper, or straightway shalt thou even be smitten with a torch, and so go forth.”	μνησαμένῳ Ὀδυσῆος, ἐπεὶ καὶ κεῖνον ὀΐω τοιάδε λαίφεʼ ἔχοντα κατʼ ἀνθρώπους ἀλάλησθαι, εἴ που ἔτι ζώει καὶ ὁρᾷ φάος ἠελίοιο. εἰ δʼ ἤδη τέθνηκε καὶ εἰν Ἀΐδαο δόμοισιν, ὤ μοι ἔπειτʼ Ὀδυσῆος ἀμύμονος, ὅς μʼ ἐπὶ βουσὶν
 Then with an angry glance from beneath his brows Odysseus of many wiles answered her: “Good woman, why, pray, dost thou thus assail me with angry heart? Is it because I am foul and wear mean raiment on my body, and beg through the land? Aye, for necessity compels me. Of such sort are beggars and vagabond folk.	εἷσʼ ἔτι τυτθὸν ἐόντα Κεφαλλήνων ἐνὶ δήμῳ. νῦν δʼ αἱ μὲν γίγνονται ἀθέσφατοι, οὐδέ κεν ἄλλως ἀνδρί γʼ ὑποσταχύοιτο βοῶν γένος εὐρυμετώπων· τὰς δʼ ἄλλοι με κέλονται ἀγινέμεναί σφισιν αὐτοῖς ἔδμεναι· οὐδέ τι παιδὸς ἐνὶ μεγάροις ἀλέγουσιν,
 For I too once dwelt in a house of my own among men, a rich man in a wealthy house, and full often I gave gifts to a wanderer, whosoever he was and with whatsoever need he came. Slaves too I had past counting and all other things in abundance whereby men live well and are reputed wealthy.	οὐδʼ ὄπιδα τρομέουσι θεῶν· μεμάασι γὰρ ἤδη κτήματα δάσσασθαι δὴν οἰχομένοιο ἄνακτος. αὐτὰρ ἐμοὶ τόδε θυμὸς ἐνὶ στήθεσσι φίλοισι πόλλʼ ἐπιδινεῖται· μάλα μὲν κακὸν υἷος ἐόντος ἄλλων δῆμον ἱκέσθαι ἰόντʼ αὐτῇσι βόεσσιν,
 But Zeus, son of Cronos, brought all to naught; so, I ween, was his good pleasure. Wherefore, woman, beware lest thou too some day lose all the glory whereby thou now hast excellence among the handmaids; lest perchance thy mistress wax wroth and be angry with thee, or Odysseus come home; for there is yet room for hope.	ἄνδρας ἐς ἀλλοδαπούς· τὸ δὲ ῥίγιον, αὖθι μένοντα βουσὶν ἐπʼ ἀλλοτρίῃσι καθήμενον ἄλγεα πάσχειν. καί κεν δὴ πάλαι ἄλλον ὑπερμενέων βασιλήων ἐξικόμην φεύγων, ἐπεὶ οὐκέτʼ ἀνεκτὰ πέλονται· ἀλλʼ ἔτι τὸν δύστηνον ὀΐομαι, εἴ ποθεν ἐλθὼν
But if, even as it seems, he is dead, and is no more to return, yet now is his son by the favour of Apollo such as he was—even Telemachus. Him it escapes not if any of the women in the halls work wantonness; for he is no longer the child he was.” So he spoke, and wise Penelope heard him;	ἀνδρῶν μνηστήρων σκέδασιν κατὰ δώματα θείῃ. τὸν δʼ ἀπαμειβόμενος προσέφη πολύμητις Ὀδυσσεύς· βουκόλʼ, ἐπεὶ οὔτε κακῷ οὔτʼ ἄφρονι φωτὶ ἔοικας, γιγνώσκω δὲ καὶ αὐτὸς ὅ τοι πινυτὴ φρένας ἵκει, τοὔνεκά τοι ἐρέω καὶ ἐπὶ μέγαν ὅρκον ὀμοῦμαι·
and she rebuked the handmaid and spoke, and addressed her: “Be sure, thou bold and shameless thing, that thy outrageous deed is in no wise hid from me, and with thine own head shalt thou wipe out its stain. Full well didst thou know, for thou hast heard it from my own lips, that I was minded	ἴστω νῦν Ζεὺς πρῶτα θεῶν ξενίη τε τράπεζα ἱστίη τʼ Ὀδυσῆος ἀμύμονος, ἣν ἀφικάνω, ἦ σέθεν ἐνθάδʼ ἐόντος ἐλεύσεται οἴκαδʼ Ὀδυσσεύς· σοῖσιν δʼ ὀφθαλμοῖσιν ἐπόψεαι, αἴ κʼ ἐθέλῃσθα, κτεινομένους μνηστῆρας, οἳ ἐνθάδε κοιρανέουσιν.
to question the stranger in my halls concerning my husband; for I am sore distressed.” With this she spoke also to the housewife Eurynome, and said: “Eurynome, bring hither a chair and a fleece upon it, that the stranger may sit down and tell his tale, and listen to me; for I am fain to ask him of all things.”	τὸν δʼ αὖτε προσέειπε βοῶν ἐπιβουκόλος ἀνήρ· αἲ γὰρ τοῦτο, ξεῖνε, ἔπος τελέσειε Κρονίων· γνοίης χʼ οἵη ἐμὴ δύναμις καὶ χεῖρες ἕπονται. ὣς δʼ αὔτως Εὔμαιος ἐπεύξατο πᾶσι θεοῖσι νοστῆσαι Ὀδυσῆα πολύφρονα ὅνδε δόμονδε.
So she spoke, and Eurynome speedily brought a polished chair and set it in place, and on it cast a fleece. Then the much-enduring, goodly Odysseus sat down upon it, and the wise Penelope spoke first, and said: “Stranger, this question will I myself ask thee first.	ὣς οἱ μὲν τοιαῦτα πρὸς ἀλλήλους ἀγόρευον, μνηστῆρες δʼ ἄρα Τηλεμάχῳ θάνατόν τε μόρον τε ἤρτυον· αὐτὰρ ὁ τοῖσιν ἀριστερὸς ἤλυθεν ὄρνις, αἰετὸς ὑψιπέτης, ἔχε δὲ τρήρωνα πέλειαν. τοῖσιν δʼ Ἀμφίνομος ἀγορήσατο καὶ μετέειπεν·
Who art thou among men, and from whence? Where is thy city, and where thy parents?” Then Odysseus of many wiles answered her, and said: “Lady, no one of mortals upon the boundless earth could find fault with thee, for thy fame goes up to the broad heaven, as does the fame of some blameless king, who with the fear of the gods in his heart,	ὦ φίλοι, οὐχ ἡμῖν συνθεύσεται ἥδε γε βουλή, Τηλεμάχοιο φόνος· ἀλλὰ μνησώμεθα δαιτός. ὣς ἔφατʼ Ἀμφίνομος, τοῖσιν δʼ ἐπιήνδανε μῦθος. ἐλθόντες δʼ ἐς δώματʼ Ὀδυσσῆος θείοιο χλαίνας μὲν κατέθεντο κατὰ κλισμούς τε θρόνους τε,
 is lord over many mighty men, upholding justice; and the black earth bears wheat and barley, and the trees are laden with fruit, the flocks bring forth young unceasingly, and the sea yields fish, all from his good leading; and the people prosper under him.	οἱ δʼ ἱέρευον ὄϊς μεγάλους καὶ πίονας αἶγας, ἵρευον δὲ σύας σιάλους καὶ βοῦν ἀγελαίην· σπλάγχνα δʼ ἄρʼ ὀπτήσαντες ἐνώμων, ἐν δέ τε οἶνον κρητῆρσιν κερόωντο· κύπελλα δὲ νεῖμε συβώτης. σῖτον δέ σφʼ ἐπένειμε Φιλοίτιος, ὄρχαμος ἀνδρῶν,
 Wherefore question me now in thy house of all things else, but ask not concerning my race and my native land, lest thou fill my heart the more with pains, as I think thereon; for I am a man of many sorrows. Moreover it is not fitting	καλοῖς ἐν κανέοισιν, ἐῳνοχόει δὲ Μελανθεύς. οἱ δʼ ἐπʼ ὀνείαθʼ ἑτοῖμα προκείμενα χεῖρας ἴαλλον. Τηλέμαχος δʼ Ὀδυσῆα καθίδρυε, κέρδεα νωμῶν, ἐντὸς ἐϋσταθέος μεγάρου, παρὰ λάϊνον οὐδόν, δίφρον ἀεικέλιον καταθεὶς ὀλίγην τε τράπεζαν·
that I should sit weeping and wailing in another's house, for it is ill to grieve ever without ceasing. I would not that one of thy maidens or thine own self be vexed with me, and say that I swim in tears because my mind is heavy with wine.” Then wise Penelope answered him: “Stranger, all excellence of mine, both of beauty and of form,	πὰρ δʼ ἐτίθει σπλάγχνων μοίρας, ἐν δʼ οἶνον ἔχευεν ἐν δέπαϊ χρυσέῳ, καί μιν πρὸς μῦθον ἔειπεν· ἐνταυθοῖ νῦν ἧσο μετʼ ἀνδράσιν οἰνοποτάζων· κερτομίας δέ τοι αὐτὸς ἐγὼ καὶ χεῖρας ἀφέξω πάντων μνηστήρων, ἐπεὶ οὔ τοι δήμιός ἐστιν
the immortals destroyed on the day when the Argives embarked for Ilios , and with them went my husband, Odysseus. If he might but come, and watch over this life of mine, greater would be my fame and fairer. But now I am in sorrow, so many woes has some god brought upon me.	οἶκος ὅδʼ, ἀλλʼ Ὀδυσῆος, ἐμοὶ δʼ ἐκτήσατο κεῖνος. ὑμεῖς δέ, μνηστῆρες, ἐπίσχετε θυμὸν ἐνιπῆς καὶ χειρῶν, ἵνα μή τις ἔρις καὶ νεῖκος ὄρηται. ὣς ἔφαθʼ, οἱ δʼ ἄρα πάντες ὀδὰξ ἐν χείλεσι φύντες Τηλέμαχον θαύμαζον, ὃ θαρσαλέως ἀγόρευε.
For all the princes who hold sway over the islands—Dulichium and Same and wooded Zacynthus—and those who dwell around in clear-seen Ithaca itself, all these woo me against my will, and lay waste my house. Wherefore I pay no heed to strangers or to suppliants	τοῖσιν δʼ Ἀντίνοος μετέφη, Εὐπείθεος υἱός· καὶ χαλεπόν περ ἐόντα δεχώμεθα μῦθον, Ἀχαιοί, Τηλεμάχου· μάλα δʼ ἧμιν ἀπειλήσας ἀγορεύει. οὐ γὰρ Ζεὺς εἴασε Κρονίων· τῷ κέ μιν ἤδη παύσαμεν ἐν μεγάροισι, λιγύν περ ἐόντʼ ἀγορητήν.
 or in any wise to heralds, whose trade is a public one; but in longing for Odysseus I waste my heart away. So these men urge on my marriage, and I wind a skein of wiles. First some god breathed the thought in my heart to set up a great web in my halls and fall to weaving a robe—	ὣς ἔφατʼ Ἀντίνοος· ὁ δʼ ἄρʼ οὐκ ἐμπάζετο μύθων. κήρυκες δʼ ἀνὰ ἄστυ θεῶν ἱερὴν ἑκατόμβην ἦγον· τοὶ δʼ ἀγέροντο κάρη κομόωντες Ἀχαιοὶ ἄλσος ὕπο σκιερὸν ἑκατηβόλου Ἀπόλλωνος. οἱ δʼ ἐπεὶ ὤπτησαν κρέʼ ὑπέρτερα καὶ ἐρύσαντο,
fine of thread was the web and very wide; and I straightway spoke among them: “‘Young men, my wooers, since goodly Odysseus is dead, be patient, though eager for my marriage, until I finish this robe—I would not that my spinning should come to naught—a shroud for the lord Laertes against the time when	μοίρας δασσάμενοι δαίνυντʼ ἐρικυδέα δαῖτα· πὰρ δʼ ἄρʼ Ὀδυσσῆϊ μοῖραν θέσαν οἳ πονέοντο ἴσην, ὡς αὐτοί περ ἐλάγχανον· ὣς γὰρ ἀνώγει Τηλέμαχος, φίλος υἱὸς Ὀδυσσῆος θείοιο. μνηστῆρας δʼ οὐ πάμπαν ἀγήνορας εἴα Ἀθήνη
the fell fate of grievous death shall strike him down; lest any one of the Achaean women in the land should be wroth with me, if he were to lie without a shroud, who had won great possessions.’ “So I spoke, and their proud hearts consented. Then day by day I would weave at the great web,	λώβης ἴσχεσθαι θυμαλγέος, ὄφρʼ ἔτι μᾶλλον δύη ἄχος κραδίην Λαερτιάδην Ὀδυσῆα. ἦν δέ τις ἐν μνηστῆρσιν ἀνὴρ ἀθεμίστια εἰδώς, Κτήσιππος δʼ ὄνομʼ ἔσκε, Σάμῃ δʼ ἐνὶ οἰκία ναῖεν· ὃς δή τοι κτεάτεσσι πεποιθὼς θεσπεσίοισι
 but by night would unravel it, when I had let place torches by me. Thus for three years I kept the Achaeans from knowing, and beguiled them; but when the fourth year came, as the seasons rolled on, as the months waned, and the many days were brought in their course, then verily by the help of my maidens, shameless creatures and reckless,	μνάσκετʼ Ὀδυσσῆος δὴν οἰχομένοιο δάμαρτα. ὅς ῥα τότε μνηστῆρσιν ὑπερφιάλοισι μετηύδα· κέκλυτέ μευ, μνηστῆρες ἀγήνορες, ὄφρα τι εἴπω· μοῖραν μὲν δὴ ξεῖνος ἔχει πάλαι, ὡς ἐπέοικεν, ἴσην· οὐ γὰρ καλὸν ἀτέμβειν οὐδὲ δίκαιον
 they came upon me and caught me, and upbraided me loudly. So I finished the web against my will perforce. And now I can neither escape the marriage nor devise any counsel more, and my parents are pressing me to marry, and my son frets, while these men devour his livelihood,	ξείνους Τηλεμάχου, ὅς κεν τάδε δώμαθʼ ἵκηται. ἀλλʼ ἄγε οἱ καὶ ἐγὼ δῶ ξείνιον, ὄφρα καὶ αὐτὸς ἠὲ λοετροχόῳ δώῃ γέρας ἠέ τῳ ἄλλῳ δμώων, οἳ κατὰ δώματʼ Ὀδυσσῆος θείοιο. ὣς εἰπὼν ἔρριψε βοὸς πόδα χειρὶ παχείῃ.
as he takes note of it all; for by now he is a man, and fully able to care for a household to which Zeus grants honor. Yet even so tell me of thy stock from whence thou art; for thou art not sprung from an oak of ancient story, or from a stone.” Then Odysseus of many wiles answered her, and said:	κείμενον ἐκ κανέοιο λαβών· ὁ δʼ ἀλεύατʼ Ὀδυσσεὺς ἦκα παρακλίνας κεφαλήν, μείδησε δὲ θυμῷ σαρδάνιον μάλα τοῖον· ὁ δʼ εὔδμητον βάλε τοῖχον. Κτήσιππον δʼ ἄρα Τηλέμαχος ἠνίπαπε μύθῳ· Κτήσιππʼ, ἦ μάλα τοι τόδε κέρδιον ἔπλετο θυμῷ·
 “Honored wife of Odysseus, son of Laertes, wilt thou never cease to ask me of my lineage? Well, I will tell thee; though verily thou wilt give me over to pains yet more than those by which I am now held in thrall; for so it ever is, when a man has been far from his country as long as I have now,	οὐκ ἔβαλες τὸν ξεῖνον· ἀλεύατο γὰρ βέλος αὐτός. ἦ γάρ κέν σε μέσον βάλον ἔγχεϊ ὀξυόεντι, καί κέ τοι ἀντὶ γάμοιο πατὴρ τάφον ἀμφεπονεῖτο ἐνθάδε. τῷ μή τίς μοι ἀεικείας ἐνὶ οἴκῳ φαινέτω· ἤδη γὰρ νοέω καὶ οἶδα ἕκαστα,
wandering through the many cities of men in sore distress. Yet even so will I tell thee what thou dost ask and enquire. There is a land called Crete , in the midst of the wine-dark sea, a fair, rich land, begirt with water, and therein are many men, past counting, and ninety cities.	ἐσθλά τε καὶ τὰ χέρηα· πάρος δʼ ἔτι νήπιος ἦα. ἀλλʼ ἔμπης τάδε μὲν καὶ τέτλαμεν εἰσορόωντες, μήλων σφαζομένων οἴνοιό τε πινομένοιο καὶ σίτου· χαλεπὸν γὰρ ἐρυκακέειν ἕνα πολλούς. ἀλλʼ ἄγε μηκέτι μοι κακὰ ῥέζετε δυσμενέοντες·
They have not all the same speech, but their tongues are mixed. There dwell Achaeans, there great-hearted native Cretans, there Cydonians, and Dorians of waving plumes, and goodly Pelasgians. Among their cities is the great city Cnosus, where Minos reigned when nine years old, he that held converse with great Zeus,	εἰ δʼ ἤδη μʼ αὐτὸν κτεῖναι μενεαίνετε χαλκῷ, καί κε τὸ βουλοίμην, καί κεν πολὺ κέρδιον εἴη τεθνάμεν ἢ τάδε γʼ αἰὲν ἀεικέα ἔργʼ ὁράασθαι, ξείνους τε στυφελιζομένους δμῳάς τε γυναῖκας ῥυστάζοντας ἀεικελίως κατὰ δώματα καλά.
and was father of my father, great-hearted Deucalion. Now Deucalion begat me and prince Idomeneus. Idomeneus had gone forth in his beaked ships to Ilios with the sons of Atreus; but my famous name is Aethon; I was the younger by birth, while he was the elder and the better man.	ὣς ἔφαθʼ, οἱ δʼ ἄρα πάντες ἀκὴν ἐγένοντο σιωπῇ· ὀψὲ δὲ δὴ μετέειπε Δαμαστορίδης Ἀγέλαος· ὦ φίλοι, οὐκ ἂν δή τις ἐπὶ ῥηθέντι δικαίῳ ἀντιβίοις ἐπέεσσι καθαπτόμενος χαλεπαίνοι· μήτε τι τὸν ξεῖνον στυφελίζετε μήτε τινʼ ἄλλον
There it was that I saw Odysseus and gave him gifts of entertainment; for the force of the wind had brought him too to Crete , as he was making for the land of Troy , and drove him out of his course past Malea. So he anchored his ships at Amnisus, where is the cave of Eilithyia, in a difficult harbor, and hardly did he escape the storm.	δμώων, οἳ κατὰ δώματʼ Ὀδυσσῆος θείοιο. Τηλεμάχῳ δέ κε μῦθον ἐγὼ καὶ μητέρι φαίην ἤπιον, εἴ σφωϊν κραδίῃ ἅδοι ἀμφοτέροιϊν. ὄφρα μὲν ὑμῖν θυμὸς ἐνὶ στήθεσσιν ἐώλπει νοστήσειν Ὀδυσῆα πολύφρονα ὅνδε δόμονδε,
Then straightway he went up to the city and asked for Idomeneus; for he declared that he was his friend, beloved and honored. But it was now the tenth or the eleventh dawn since Idomeneus had gone in his beaked ships to Ilios . So I took him to the house, and gave him entertainment	τόφρʼ οὔ τις νέμεσις μενέμεν τʼ ἦν ἰσχέμεναί τε μνηστῆρας κατὰ δώματʼ, ἐπεὶ τόδε κέρδιον ἦεν, εἰ νόστησʼ Ὀδυσεὺς καὶ ὑπότροπος ἵκετο δῶμα· νῦν δʼ ἤδη τόδε δῆλον, ὅ τʼ οὐκέτι νόστιμός ἐστιν. ἀλλʼ ἄγε, σῇ τάδε μητρὶ παρεζόμενος κατάλεξον,
 with kindly welcome of the rich store that was in the house, and to the rest of his comrades who followed with him I gathered and gave out of the public store barley meal and flaming wine and bulls for sacrifice, that their hearts might be satisfied. There for twelve days the goodly Achaeans tarried,	γήμασθʼ ὅς τις ἄριστος ἀνὴρ καὶ πλεῖστα πόρῃσιν, ὄφρα σὺ μὲν χαίρων πατρώϊα πάντα νέμηαι, ἔσθων καὶ πίνων, ἡ δʼ ἄλλου δῶμα κομίζῃ. τὸν δʼ αὖ Τηλέμαχος πεπνυμένος ἀντίον ηὔδα· οὐ μὰ Ζῆνʼ, Ἀγέλαε, καὶ ἄλγεα πατρὸς ἐμοῖο,
for the strong North Wind penned them there, and would not suffer them to stand upon their feet on the land, for some angry god had roused it. But on the thirteenth day the wind fell and they put to sea.” He spoke, and made the many falsehoods of his tale seem like the truth, and as she listened her tears flowed and her face melted	ὅς που τῆλʼ Ἰθάκης ἢ ἔφθιται ἢ ἀλάληται, οὔ τι διατρίβω μητρὸς γάμον, ἀλλὰ κελεύω γήμασθʼ ᾧ κʼ ἐθέλῃ, ποτὶ δʼ ἄσπετα δῶρα δίδωμι. αἰδέομαι δʼ ἀέκουσαν ἀπὸ μεγάροιο δίεσθαι μύθῳ ἀναγκαίῳ· μὴ τοῦτο θεὸς τελέσειεν.
in his heart had pity for his weeping wife, but his eyes stood fixed between his lids as though they were horn or iron, and with guile he hid his tears. But she, when she had had her fill of tearful wailing, again answered him and spoke, saying:	ὣς φάτο Τηλέμαχος· μνηστῆρσι δὲ Παλλὰς Ἀθήνη ἄσβεστον γέλω ὦρσε, παρέπλαγξεν δὲ νόημα. οἱ δʼ ἤδη γναθμοῖσι γελοίων ἀλλοτρίοισιν, αἱμοφόρυκτα δὲ δὴ κρέα ἤσθιον· ὄσσε δʼ ἄρα σφέων δακρυόφιν πίμπλαντο, γόον δʼ ὠΐετο θυμός.
“Now verily, stranger, am I minded to put thee to the test, whether or no thou didst in very truth entertain there in thy halls my husband with his godlike comrades, even as thou sayest. Tell me what manner of raiment he wore about his body, and what manner of man he was himself; and tell me of the comrades who followed him.”	τοῖσι δὲ καὶ μετέειπε Θεοκλύμενος θεοειδής· ἆ δειλοί, τί κακὸν τόδε πάσχετε; νυκτὶ μὲν ὑμέων εἰλύαται κεφαλαί τε πρόσωπά τε νέρθε τε γοῦνα. οἰμωγὴ δὲ δέδηε, δεδάκρυνται δὲ παρειαί, αἵματι δʼ ἐρράδαται τοῖχοι καλαί τε μεσόδμαι·
 Then Odysseus of many wiles answered her, and said: “Lady, hard is it for one that has been so long afar to tell thee this, for it is now the twentieth year since he went thence and departed from my country. But I will tell thee as my mind pictures him.	εἰδώλων δὲ πλέον πρόθυρον, πλείη δὲ καὶ αὐλή, ἱεμένων Ἔρεβόσδε ὑπὸ ζόφον· ἠέλιος δὲ οὐρανοῦ ἐξαπόλωλε, κακὴ δʼ ἐπιδέδρομεν ἀχλύς. ὣς ἔφαθʼ, οἱ δʼ ἄρα πάντες ἐπʼ αὐτῷ ἡδὺ γέλασσαν. τοῖσιν δʼ Εὐρύμαχος, Πολύβου πάϊς, ἦρχʼ ἀγορεύειν·
A fleecy cloak of purple did goodly Odysseus wear, a cloak of double fold, but the brooch upon it was fashioned of gold with double clasps, and on the front it was curiously wrought: a hound held in his fore paws a dappled fawn, and pinned it in his jaws as it writhed. And at this all men marvelled,	ἀφραίνει ξεῖνος νέον ἄλλοθεν εἰληλουθώς. ἀλλά μιν αἶψα, νέοι, δόμου ἐκπέμψασθε θύραζε εἰς ἀγορὴν ἔρχεσθαι, ἐπεὶ τάδε νυκτὶ ἐΐσκει. τὸν δʼ αὖτε προσέειπε Θεοκλύμενος θεοειδής· Εὐρύμαχʼ, οὔ τί σʼ ἄνωγα ἐμοὶ πομπῆας ὀπάζειν·
 how, though they were of gold, the hound was pinning the fawn and strangling it, and the fawn was writhing with its feet and striving to flee. And I noted the tunic about his body, all shining as is the sheen upon the skin of a dried onion, so soft it was; and it glistened like the sun.	εἰσί μοι ὀφθαλμοί τε καὶ οὔατα καὶ πόδες ἄμφω καὶ νόος ἐν στήθεσσι τετυγμένος οὐδὲν ἀεικής. τοῖς ἔξειμι θύραζε, ἐπεὶ νοέω κακὸν ὔμμιν ἐρχόμενον, τό κεν οὔ τις ὑπεκφύγοι οὐδʼ ἀλέαιτο μνηστήρων, οἳ δῶμα κάτʼ ἀντιθέου Ὀδυσῆος
 Verily many women gazed at him in wonder. And another thing will I tell thee, and do thou lay it to heart. I know not whether Odysseus was thus clothed at home, or whether one of his comrades gave him the raiment when he went on board the swift ship, or haply even some stranger, since to many men	ἀνέρας ὑβρίζοντες ἀτάσθαλα μηχανάασθε. ὣς εἰπὼν ἐξῆλθε δόμων εὖ ναιεταόντων, ἵκετο δʼ ἐς Πείραιον, ὅ μιν πρόφρων ὑπέδεκτο. μνηστῆρες δʼ ἄρα πάντες ἐς ἀλλήλους ὁρόωντες Τηλέμαχον ἐρέθιζον, ἐπὶ ξείνοις γελόωντες·
was Odysseus dear, for few of the Achaeans were his peers. I, too, gave him a sword of bronze, and a fair purple cloak of double fold, and a fringed tunic, and with all honor sent him forth on his benched ship. Furthermore, a herald	ὧδε δέ τις εἴπεσκε νέων ὑπερηνορεόντων· Τηλέμαχʼ, οὔ τις σεῖο κακοξεινώτερος ἄλλος· οἷον μέν τινα τοῦτον ἔχεις ἐπίμαστον ἀλήτην, σίτου καὶ οἴνου κεχρημένον, οὐδέ τι ἔργων ἔμπαιον οὐδὲ βίης, ἀλλʼ αὔτως ἄχθος ἀρούρης.
attended him, a little older than he, and I will tell thee of him too, what manner of man he was. He was round-shouldered, dark of skin, and curly-haired, and his name was Eurybates; and Odysseus honored him above his other comrades, because he was like-minded with himself.” So he spoke, and in her heart aroused yet more the desire of weeping,	ἄλλος δʼ αὖτέ τις οὗτος ἀνέστη μαντεύεσθαι. ἀλλʼ εἴ μοί τι πίθοιο, τό κεν πολὺ κέρδιον εἴη· τοὺς ξείνους ἐν νηῒ πολυκληῗδι βαλόντες ἐς Σικελοὺς πέμψωμεν, ὅθεν κέ τοι ἄξιον ἄλφοι. ὣς ἔφασαν μνηστῆρες· ὁ δʼ οὐκ ἐμπάζετο μύθων,
as she recognized the sure tokens that Odysseus told her. But she, when she had had her fill of tearful wailing, made answer and said to him: “Now verily, stranger, though before thou wast pitied, shalt thou be dear and honored in my halls,	ἀλλʼ ἀκέων πατέρα προσεδέρκετο, δέγμενος αἰεί, ὁππότε δὴ μνηστῆρσιν ἀναιδέσι χεῖρας ἐφήσει. ἡ δὲ κατʼ ἄντηστιν θεμένη περικαλλέα δίφρον κούρη Ἰκαρίοιο, περίφρων Πηνελόπεια, ἀνδρῶν ἐν μεγάροισιν ἑκάστου μῦθον ἄκουεν.
 for it was I that gave him this raiment, since thou describest it thus, and folded it, and brought it forth from the store-room, and added thereto the shining brooch to be a thing of joy to him. But my husband I shall never welcome back, returning home to his dear native land. Wherefore it was with an evil fate that Odysseus	δεῖπνον μὲν γάρ τοί γε γελοίωντες τετύκοντο ἡδὺ τε καὶ μενοεικές, ἐπεὶ μάλα πόλλʼ ἱέρευσαν· δόρπου δʼ οὐκ ἄν πως ἀχαρίστερον ἄλλο γένοιτο, οἷον δὴ τάχʼ ἔμελλε θεὰ καὶ καρτερὸς ἀνὴρ θησέμεναι· πρότεροι γὰρ ἀεικέα μηχανόωντο.
 for any woman weeps when she has lost her wedded husband, to whom she has borne children in her love, though he were far other than Odysseus, who, they say, is like unto the gods. Yet do thou cease from weeping, and hearken to my words; for I will tell thee with sure truth, and will hide nothing,	τῇ δʼ ἄρʼ ἐπὶ φρεσὶ θῆκε θεὰ γλαυκῶπις Ἀθήνη, κούρῃ Ἰκαρίοιο, περίφρονι Πηνελοπείῃ, τόξον μνηστήρεσσι θέμεν πολιόν τε σίδηρον ἐν μεγάροις Ὀδυσῆος, ἀέθλια καὶ φόνου ἀρχήν.
 how but lately I heard of the return of Odysseus, that he is near at hand in the rich land of the Thesprotians, and yet alive, and he is bringing with him many rich treasures, as he begs through the land. But he lost his trusty comrades and his hollow ship on the wine-dark sea,	κλίμακα δʼ ὑψηλὴν προσεβήσετο οἷο δόμοιο, εἵλετο δὲ κληῗδʼ εὐκαμπέα χειρὶ παχείῃ καλὴν χαλκείην· κώπη δʼ ἐλέφαντος ἐπῆεν. βῆ δʼ ἴμεναι θάλαμόνδε σὺν ἀμφιπόλοισι γυναιξὶν ἔσχατον· ἔνθα δέ οἱ κειμήλια κεῖτο ἄνακτος,
as he journeyed from the isle Thrinacia; for Zeus and Helios waxed wroth against him because his comrades had slain the kine of Helios. So they all perished in the surging sea, but he on the keel of his ship was cast forth by the wave on the shore, on the land of the Phaeacians, who are near of kin to the gods.	χαλκός τε χρυσός τε πολύκμητός τε σίδηρος. ἔνθα δὲ τόξον κεῖτο παλίντονον ἠδὲ φαρέτρη ἰοδόκος, πολλοὶ δʼ ἔνεσαν στονόεντες ὀϊστοί, δῶρα τά οἱ ξεῖνος Λακεδαίμονι δῶκε τυχήσας Ἴφιτος Εὐρυτίδης, ἐπιείκελος ἀθανάτοισι.
 These heartily showed him all honor, as if he were a god, and gave him many gifts, and were fain themselves to send him home unscathed. Yea, and Odysseus would long since have been here, only it seemed to his mind more profitable to gather wealth by roaming over the wide earth;	τὼ δʼ ἐν Μεσσήνῃ ξυμβλήτην ἀλλήλοιϊν οἴκῳ ἐν Ὀρτιλόχοιο δαΐφρονος. ἦ τοι Ὀδυσσεὺς ἦλθε μετὰ χρεῖος, τό ῥά οἱ πᾶς δῆμος ὄφελλε· μῆλα γὰρ ἐξ Ἰθάκης Μεσσήνιοι ἄνδρες ἄειραν νηυσὶ πολυκλήϊσι τριηκόσιʼ ἠδὲ νομῆας.
 so truly does Odysseus beyond all mortal men know many gainful ways, nor could any mortal beside vie with him. Thus Pheidon, king of the Thesprotians, told me the tale. Moreover he swore in my own presence, as he poured libations in his halls, that the ship was launched and the men ready	τῶν ἕνεκʼ ἐξεσίην πολλὴν ὁδὸν ἦλθεν Ὀδυσσεὺς παιδνὸς ἐών· πρὸ γὰρ ἧκε πατὴρ ἄλλοι τε γέροντες. Ἴφιτος αὖθʼ ἵππους διζήμενος, αἵ οἱ ὄλοντο δώδεκα θήλειαι, ὑπὸ δʼ ἡμίονοι ταλαεργοί· αἳ δή οἱ καὶ ἔπειτα φόνος καὶ μοῖρα γένοντο,
 who were to convey him to his dear native land. But me he sent forth first, for a ship of the Thesprotians chanced to be setting out for Dulichium, rich in wheat. And he showed me all the treasure that Odysseus had gathered; verily unto the tenth generation would it feed his children after him,	ἐπεὶ δὴ Διὸς υἱὸν ἀφίκετο καρτερόθυμον, φῶθʼ Ἡρακλῆα, μεγάλων ἐπιίστορα ἔργων, ὅς μιν ξεῖνον ἐόντα κατέκτανεν ᾧ ἐνὶ οἴκῳ, σχέτλιος, οὐδὲ θεῶν ὄπιν ᾐδέσατʼ οὐδὲ τράπεζαν, τὴν ἥν οἱ παρέθηκεν· ἔπειτα δὲ πέφνε καὶ αὐτόν,
so great was the wealth that lay stored for him in the halls of the king. But Odysseus, he said, had gone to Dodona to hear the will of Zeus from the high-crested oak of the god, even how he might return to his dear native land after so long an absence, whether openly or in secret.	ἵππους δʼ αὐτὸς ἔχε κρατερώνυχας ἐν μεγάροισι. τὰς ἐρέων Ὀδυσῆϊ συνήντετο, δῶκε δὲ τόξον, τὸ πρὶν μέν ῥʼ ἐφόρει μέγας Εὔρυτος, αὐτὰρ ὁ παιδὶ κάλλιπʼ ἀποθνῄσκων ἐν δώμασιν ὑψηλοῖσι. τῷ δʼ Ὀδυσεὺς ξίφος ὀξὺ καὶ ἄλκιμον ἔγχος ἔδωκεν,
 “Thus, as I tell thee, he is safe, and will presently come; he is very near, and not long will he now be far from his friends and his native land. Yet will I give thee an oath. Be Zeus my witness first, highest and best of gods, and the hearth of noble Odysseus to which I am come,	ἀρχὴν ξεινοσύνης προσκηδέος· οὐδὲ τραπέζῃ γνώτην ἀλλήλων· πρὶν γὰρ Διὸς υἱὸς ἔπεφνεν Ἴφιτον Εὐρυτίδην, ἐπιείκελον ἀθανάτοισιν, ὅς οἱ τόξον ἔδωκε. τὸ δʼ οὔ ποτε δῖος Ὀδυσσεὺς ἐρχόμενος πόλεμόνδε μελαινάων ἐπὶ νηῶν
that verily all these things shall be brought to pass even as I tell thee. In the course of this very month shall Odysseus come hither, as the old moon wanes and the new appears.” Then wise Penelope answered him: “Ah, stranger, I would that this word of thine might be fulfilled.	ᾑρεῖτʼ, ἀλλʼ αὐτοῦ μνῆμα ξείνοιο φίλοιο κέσκετʼ ἐνὶ μεγάροισι, φόρει δέ μιν ἧς ἐπὶ γαίης. ἡ δʼ ὅτε δὴ θάλαμον τὸν ἀφίκετο δῖα γυναικῶν οὐδόν τε δρύϊνον προσεβήσετο, τόν ποτε τέκτων ξέσσεν ἐπισταμένως καὶ ἐπὶ στάθμην ἴθυνεν,
 Then shouldest thou straightway know of kindness and many a gift from me, so that one who met thee would call thee blessed. Yet in my heart I forebode it thus, even as it shall be. Neither shall Odysseus any more come home, nor shalt thou obtain a convoy hence, since there are not now in the house such masters	ἐν δὲ σταθμοὺς ἄρσε, θύρας δʼ ἐπέθηκε φαεινάς, αὐτίκʼ ἄρʼ ἥ γʼ ἱμάντα θοῶς ἀπέλυσε κορώνης, ἐν δὲ κληῗδʼ ἧκε, θυρέων δʼ ἀνέκοπτεν ὀχῆας ἄντα τιτυσκομένη· τὰ δʼ ἀνέβραχεν ἠΰτε ταῦρος βοσκόμενος λειμῶνι· τόσʼ ἔβραχε καλὰ θύρετρα
as Odysseus was among men—as sure as ever such a man there was—to send reverend strangers on their way, and to welcome them. But still, my maidens, wash the stranger's feet and prepare his bed—bedstead and cloaks and bright coverlets—that in warmth and comfort he may come to the golden-throned Dawn.	πληγέντα κληΐδι, πετάσθησαν δέ οἱ ὦκα. ἡ δʼ ἄρʼ ἐφʼ ὑψηλῆς σανίδος βῆ· ἔνθα δὲ χηλοὶ ἕστασαν, ἐν δʼ ἄρα τῇσι θυώδεα εἵματʼ ἔκειτο. ἔνθεν ὀρεξαμένη ἀπὸ πασσάλου αἴνυτο τόξον αὐτῷ γωρυτῷ, ὅς οἱ περίκειτο φαεινός.
 And right early in the morning bathe him and anoint him, that in our house at the side of Telemachus he may bethink him of food as he sits in the hall. And worse shall it be for any man among them who vexes this man's soul with pain; naught thereafter shall he accomplish here, how fierce soever his wrath.	ἑζομένη δὲ κατʼ αὖθι, φίλοις ἐπὶ γούνασι θεῖσα, κλαῖε μάλα λιγέως, ἐκ δʼ ᾕρεε τόξον ἄνακτος. ἡ δʼ ἐπεὶ οὖν τάρφθη πολυδακρύτοιο γόοιο, βῆ ῥʼ ἴμεναι μέγαρόνδε μετὰ μνηστῆρας ἀγαυοὺς τόξον ἔχουσʼ ἐν χειρὶ παλίντονον ἠδὲ φαρέτρην
 For how shalt thou learn of me, stranger, whether I in any wise excel other women in wit and prudent counsel, if all unkempt and clad in poor raiment thou sittest at meat in my halls? Men are but short-lived. If one be himself hard, and have a hard heart,	ἰοδόκον· πολλοὶ δʼ ἔνεσαν στονόεντες ὀϊστοί. τῇ δʼ ἄρʼ ἅμʼ ἀμφίπολοι φέρον ὄγκιον, ἔνθα σίδηρος κεῖτο πολὺς καὶ χαλκός, ἀέθλια τοῖο ἄνακτος. ἡ δʼ ὅτε δὴ μνηστῆρας ἀφίκετο δῖα γυναικῶν, στῆ ῥα παρὰ σταθμὸν τέγεος πύκα ποιητοῖο,
on him do all mortal men invoke woes for the time to come, while he still lives, and when he is dead all men mock at him. But if one be blameless and have a blameless heart, his fame do strangers bear far and wide among all men, and many call him a true man.”	ἄντα παρειάων σχομένη λιπαρὰ κρήδεμνα. ἀμφίπολος δʼ ἄρα οἱ κεδνὴ ἑκάτερθε παρέστη. αὐτίκα δὲ μνηστῆρσι μετηύδα καὶ φάτο μῦθον· κέκλυτέ μευ, μνηστῆρες ἀγήνορες, οἳ τόδε δῶμα ἐχράετʼ ἐσθιέμεν καὶ πινέμεν ἐμμενὲς αἰεὶ
Then Odysseus of many wiles answered her, and said: “Honored wife of Odysseus, son of Laertes, verily cloaks and bright coverlets became hateful in my eyes on the day when first I left behind me the snowy mountains of Crete , as I fared on my long-oared ship.	ἀνδρὸς ἀποιχομένοιο πολὺν χρόνον· οὐδέ τινʼ ἄλλην μύθου ποιήσασθαι ἐπισχεσίην ἐδύνασθε, ἀλλʼ ἐμὲ ἱέμενοι γῆμαι θέσθαι τε γυναῖκα. ἀλλʼ ἄγετε, μνηστῆρες, ἐπεὶ τόδε φαίνετʼ ἄεθλον. θήσω γὰρ μέγα τόξον Ὀδυσσῆος θείοιο·
 Nay, I will lie, as in time past I was wont to rest through sleepless nights; for many a night have I lain upon a foul bed and waited for the bright-throned Dawn. Aye, and baths for the feet give my heart no pleasure, nor shall any woman touch my foot	ὃς δέ κε ῥηΐτατʼ ἐντανύσῃ βιὸν ἐν παλάμῃσι καὶ διοϊστεύσῃ πελέκεων δυοκαίδεκα πάντων, τῷ κεν ἅμʼ ἑσποίμην, νοσφισσαμένη τόδε δῶμα κουρίδιον, μάλα καλόν, ἐνίπλειον βιότοιο, τοῦ ποτὲ μεμνήσεσθαι ὀΐομαι ἔν περ ὀνείρῳ.
of all those who are serving-women in thy hall, unless there is some old, true-hearted dame who has suffered in her heart as many woes as I; such an one I would not grudge to touch my feet.” Then wise Penelope answered him again:	ὣς φάτο, καί ῥʼ Εὔμαιον ἀνώγει, δῖον ὑφορβόν, τόξον μνηστήρεσσι θέμεν πολιόν τε σίδηρον. δακρύσας δʼ Εὔμαιος ἐδέξατο καὶ κατέθηκε· κλαῖε δὲ βουκόλος ἄλλοθʼ, ἐπεὶ ἴδε τόξον ἄνακτος. Ἀντίνοος δʼ ἐνένιπεν ἔπος τʼ ἔφατʼ ἔκ τʼ ὀνόμαζε·
 “Dear stranger, never yet has a man discreet as thou, of those who are strangers from afar, come to my house as a more welcome guest, so wise and prudent are all thy words. I have an old dame with a heart of understanding in her breast, who lovingly nursed and cherished my hapless husband,	νήπιοι ἀγροιῶται, ἐφημέρια φρονέοντες, ἆ δειλώ, τί νυ δάκρυ κατείβετον ἠδὲ γυναικὶ θυμὸν ἐνὶ στήθεσσιν ὀρίνετον; ᾗ τε καὶ ἄλλως κεῖται ἐν ἄλγεσι θυμός, ἐπεὶ φίλον ὤλεσʼ ἀκοίτην. ἀλλʼ ἀκέων δαίνυσθε καθήμενοι, ἠὲ θύραζε
 and took him in her arms on the day when his mother bore him. She shall wash thy feet, weak with age though she be. Come now, wise Eurycleia, arise and wash the feet of one of like age with thy master. Even such as his are now haply the feet of Odysseus, and such his hands,	κλαίετον ἐξελθόντε, κατʼ αὐτόθι τόξα λιπόντε, μνηστήρεσσιν ἄεθλον ἀάατον· οὐ γὰρ ὀΐω ῥηϊδίως τόδε τόξον ἐΰξοον ἐντανύεσθαι. οὐ γάρ τις μέτα τοῖος ἀνὴρ ἐν τοίσδεσι πᾶσιν οἷος Ὀδυσσεὺς ἔσκεν· ἐγὼ δέ μιν αὐτὸς ὄπωπα,
for quickly do men grow old in evil fortune.” So she spoke, and the old woman hid her face in her hands and let fall hot tears, uttering words of lamentation: “Ah, woe is me, child, because of thee, for that I can do naught. Surely Zeus hated thee above all men, though thou hadst a god-fearing heart.	καὶ γὰρ μνήμων εἰμί, πάϊς δʼ ἔτι νήπιος ἦα. ὣς φάτο, τῷ δʼ ἄρα θυμὸς ἐνὶ στήθεσσιν ἐώλπει νευρὴν ἐντανύσειν διοϊστεύσειν τε σιδήρου. ἦ τοι ὀϊστοῦ γε πρῶτος γεύσεσθαι ἔμελλεν ἐκ χειρῶν Ὀδυσῆος ἀμύμονος, ὃν τότʼ ἀτίμα
 For never yet did any mortal burn to Zeus, who hurls the thunderbolt, so many fat thigh-pieces or so many choice hecatombs as thou gavest him, with prayers that thou mightest reach a sleek old age and rear thy glorious son. But lo, now, from thee alone has he wholly cut off the day of thy returning.	ἥμενος ἐν μεγάροις, ἐπὶ δʼ ὤρνυε πάντας ἑταίρους. τοῖσι δὲ καὶ μετέειφʼ ἱερὴ ἲς Τηλεμάχοιο· ὢ πόποι, ἦ μάλα με Ζεὺς ἄφρονα θῆκε Κρονίων· μήτηρ μέν μοί φησι φίλη, πινυτή περ ἐοῦσα, ἄλλῳ ἅμʼ ἕψεσθαι νοσφισσαμένη τόδε δῶμα·
Even thus, I ween, did women mock at him too, in a strange and distant land, when he came to some man's glorious house, as these shameless creatures here all mock at thee. It is to shun insult now from them and their many taunts that thou dost not suffer them to wash thy feet, but me, who am nothing loath, has	αὐτὰρ ἐγὼ γελόω καὶ τέρπομαι ἄφρονι θυμῷ. ἀλλʼ ἄγετε, μνηστῆρες, ἐπεὶ τόδε φαίνετʼ ἄεθλον, οἵη νῦν οὐκ ἔστι γυνὴ κατʼ Ἀχαιΐδα γαῖαν, οὔτε Πύλου ἱερῆς οὔτʼ Ἄργεος οὔτε Μυκήνης· οὔτʼ αὐτῆς Ἰθάκης οὔτʼ ἠπείροιο μελαίνης·
 the daughter of Icarius, wise Penelope, bidden to wash thee. Therefore will I wash thy feet, both for Penelope's own sake and for thine, for the heart within me is stirred with sorrow. But come now, hearken to the word that I shall speak. Many sore-tried strangers have come hither,	καὶ δʼ αὐτοὶ τόδε γʼ ἴστε· τί με χρὴ μητέρος αἴνου; ἀλλʼ ἄγε μὴ μύνῃσι παρέλκετε μηδʼ ἔτι τόξου δηρὸν ἀποτρωπᾶσθε τανυστύος, ὄφρα ἴδωμεν. καὶ δέ κεν αὐτὸς ἐγὼ τοῦ τόξου πειρησαίμην· εἰ δέ κεν ἐντανύσω διοϊστεύσω τε σιδήρου,
but I declare that never yet have I seen any man so like another as thou in form, and in voice, and in feet art like Odysseus.” Then Odysseus of many wiles answered her, and said: “Old dame, so say all men whose eyes have beheld us two, that	οὔ κέ μοι ἀχνυμένῳ τάδε δώματα πότνια μήτηρ λείποι ἅμʼ ἄλλῳ ἰοῦσʼ, ὅτʼ ἐγὼ κατόπισθε λιποίμην οἷός τʼ ἤδη πατρὸς ἀέθλια κάλʼ ἀνελέσθαι. ἦ καὶ ἀπʼ ὤμοιϊν χλαῖναν θέτο φοινικόεσσαν ὀρθὸς ἀναΐξας, ἀπὸ δὲ ξίφος ὀξὺ θέτʼ ὤμων.
we are very like each other, even as thou thyself dost note and say.” So he spoke, and the old dame took the shining cauldron with water wherefrom she was about to wash his feet, and poured in cold water in plenty, and then added thereto the warm. But Odysseus sat him down away from the hearth and straightway turned himself toward the darkness,	πρῶτον μὲν πελέκεας στῆσεν, διὰ τάφρον ὀρύξας πᾶσι μίαν μακρήν, καὶ ἐπὶ στάθμην ἴθυνεν, ἀμφὶ δὲ γαῖαν ἔναξε· τάφος δʼ ἕλε πάντας ἰδόντας, ὡς εὐκόσμως στῆσε· πάρος δʼ οὐ πώ ποτʼ ὀπώπει. στῆ δʼ ἄρʼ ἐπʼ οὐδὸν ἰὼν καὶ τόξου πειρήτιζε.
for he at once had a foreboding at heart that, as she touched him, she might note a scar, and the truth be made manifest. So she drew near and began to wash her lord, and straightway knew the scar of the wound which long ago a boar had dealt him with his white tusk, when Odysseus had gone to Parnassus to visit Autolycus and the sons of Autolycus,	τρὶς μέν μιν πελέμιξεν ἐρύσσεσθαι μενεαίνων, τρὶς δὲ μεθῆκε βίης, ἐπιελπόμενος τό γε θυμῷ, νευρὴν ἐντανύειν διοϊστεύσειν τε σιδήρου. καί νύ κε δή ῥʼ ἐτάνυσσε βίῃ τὸ τέταρτον ἀνέλκων, ἀλλʼ Ὀδυσεὺς ἀνένευε καὶ ἔσχεθεν ἱέμενόν περ.
his mother's noble father, who excelled all men in thievery and in oaths. It was a god himself that had given him this skill, even Hermes, for to him he was wont to burn acceptable sacrifices of the thighs of lambs and kids; so Hermes befriended him with a ready heart. Now Autolycus, on coming once to the rich land of Ithaca ,	τοῖς δʼ αὖτις μετέειφʼ ἱερὴ ἲς Τηλεμάχοιο· ὢ πόποι, ἦ καὶ ἔπειτα κακός τʼ ἔσομαι καὶ ἄκικυς, ἠὲ νεώτερός εἰμι καὶ οὔ πω χερσὶ πέποιθα ἄνδρʼ ἀπαμύνασθαι, ὅτε τις πρότερος χαλεπήνῃ. ἀλλʼ ἄγεθʼ, οἵ περ ἐμεῖο βίῃ προφερέστεροί ἐστε,
had found his daughter's son a babe new-born, and when he was finishing his supper, Eurycleia laid the child upon his knees and spoke, and addressed him: “Autolycus, find now thyself a name to give to thy child's own child; be sure he has long been prayed for.”	τόξου πειρήσασθε, καὶ ἐκτελέωμεν ἄεθλον. ὣς εἰπὼν τόξον μὲν ἀπὸ ἕο θῆκε χαμᾶζε, κλίνας κολλητῇσιν ἐϋξέστῃς σανίδεσσιν, αὐτοῦ δʼ ὠκὺ βέλος καλῇ προσέκλινε κορώνῃ, ἂψ δʼ αὖτις κατʼ ἄρʼ ἕζετʼ ἐπὶ θρόνου ἔνθεν ἀνέστη.
Then Autolycus answered her, and said: “My daughter's husband and my daughter, give him whatsoever name I say. Lo, inasmuch as I am come hither as one that has been angered with many, both men and women, over the fruitful earth, therefore let the name by which the child is named be Odysseus. And for my part,	τοῖσιν δʼ Ἀντίνοος μετέφη, Εὐπείθεος υἱός· ὄρνυσθʼ ἑξείης ἐπιδέξια πάντες ἑταῖροι, ἀρξάμενοι τοῦ χώρου ὅθεν τέ περ οἰνοχοεύει. ὣς ἔφατʼ Ἀντίνοος, τοῖσιν δʼ ἐπιήνδανε μῦθος. Λειώδης δὲ πρῶτος ἀνίστατο, Οἴνοπος υἱός,
when he is a man grown and comes to the great house of his mother's kin at Parnassus , where are my possessions, I will give him thereof and send him back rejoicing.” It was for this reason that Odysseus had come, that Autolycus might give him the glorious gifts. And Autolycus and the sons of Autolycus	ὅ σφι θυοσκόος ἔσκε, παρὰ κρητῆρα δὲ καλὸν ἷζε μυχοίτατος αἰέν· ἀτασθαλίαι δέ οἱ οἴῳ ἐχθραὶ ἔσαν, πᾶσιν δὲ νεμέσσα μνηστήρεσσιν· ὅς ῥα τότε πρῶτος τόξον λάβε καὶ βέλος ὠκύ. στῆ δʼ ἄρʼ ἐπʼ οὐδὸν ἰὼν καὶ τόξου πειρήτιζεν,
 clasped his hands in welcome and greeted him with gentle words, and Amphithea, his mother's mother, took Odysseus in her arms and kissed his head and both his beautiful eyes. But Autolycus called to his glorious sons to make ready the meal, and they hearkened to his call.	οὐδέ μιν ἐντάνυσε· πρὶν γὰρ κάμε χεῖρας ἀνέλκων ἀτρίπτους ἁπαλάς· μετὰ δὲ μνηστῆρσιν ἔειπεν· ὦ φίλοι, οὐ μὲν ἐγὼ τανύω, λαβέτω δὲ καὶ ἄλλος. πολλοὺς γὰρ τόδε τόξον ἀριστῆας κεκαδήσει θυμοῦ καὶ ψυχῆς, ἐπεὶ ἦ πολὺ φέρτερόν ἐστι
 At once they led in a bull, five years old, which they flayed and dressed, and cut up all the limbs. Then they sliced these cunningly and pierced them with spits, and roasted them skilfully and distributed the portions. So, then, all day long till set of sun	τεθνάμεν ἢ ζώοντας ἁμαρτεῖν, οὗθʼ ἕνεκʼ αἰεὶ ἐνθάδʼ ὁμιλέομεν, ποτιδέγμενοι ἤματα πάντα. νῦν μέν τις καὶ ἔλπετʼ ἐνὶ φρεσὶν ἠδὲ μενοινᾷ γῆμαι Πηνελόπειαν, Ὀδυσσῆος παράκοιτιν. αὐτὰρ ἐπὴν τόξου πειρήσεται ἠδὲ ἴδηται,
they feasted, nor did their hearts lack aught of the equal feast. But when the sun set and darkness came on they lay down to rest and took the gift of sleep. But as soon as early Dawn appeared, the rosy-fingered, they went forth to the hunt, the hounds and the sons of Autolycus too, and with them went goodly Odysseus. Up the steep mountain Parnassus , clothed with forests, they climbed, and presently reached its windy hollows. The sun was now just striking on the fields, as he rose from softly-gliding, deep-flowing Oceanus, when the beaters came to a glade. Before them went the hounds, tracking the scent, and behind them the sons of Autolycus, and among these the goodly Odysseus followed, close upon the hounds, brandishing his long spear. Now thereby a great wild boar was lying in a thick lair, through which the strength of the wet winds could never blow nor the rays of the bright sun beat, nor could the rain pierce through it, so thick it was; and fallen leaves were there in plenty. Then about the boar there came the noise of the feet of men and dogs as they pressed on in the chase, and forth from his lair he came against them with bristling back and eyes flashing fire, and stood there at bay close before them. Then first of all Odysseus rushed on, holding his long spear on high in his stout hand, eager to smite him; but the boar was too quick for him and struck him above the knee, charging upon him sideways, and with his tusk tore a long gash in the flesh, but did not reach the bone of the man. But Odysseus with sure aim smote him on the right shoulder, and clear through went the point of the bright spear, and the boar fell in the dust with a cry, and his life flew from him. Then the dear sons of Autolycus busied themselves with the carcase, and the wound of noble, god-like Odysseus they bound up skilfully, and checked the black blood with a charm, and straightway returned to the house of their dear father. And when Autolycus and the sons of Autolycus had fully healed him, and had given him glorious gifts, they quickly sent him back with joy to his native land, to Ithaca . Then his father and his honored mother rejoiced at his return, and asked him all the story, how he got his wound; and he told them all the truth, how, while he was hunting, a boar had struck him with his white tusk when he had gone to Parnassus with the sons of Autolycus. This scar the old dame, when she had taken the limb in the flat of her hands, knew by the touch, and she let fall the foot. Into the basin the leg fell, and the brazen vessel rang. Over it tilted, and the water was spilled upon the ground. Then upon her soul came joy and grief in one moment, and both her eyes were filled with tears and the flow of her voice was checked. But she touched the chin of Odysseus, and said: “Verily thou art Odysseus, dear child, and I knew thee not, till I had handled all the body of my lord.” She spoke, and with her eyes looked toward Penelope, fain to show her that her dear husband was at home. But Penelope could not meet her glance nor understand, for Athena had turned her thoughts aside. But Odysseus, feeling for the woman's throat, seized it with his right hand, and with the other drew her closer to him, and said: “Mother, why wilt thou destroy me? Thou didst thyself nurse me at this thy breast, and now after many grievous toils I am come in the twentieth year to my native land. But since thou hast found me out, and a god has put this in thy heart, be silent lest any other in the halls learn hereof. For thus will I speak out to thee, and verily it shall be brought to pass: if a god shall subdue the lordly wooers unto me, I will not spare thee, my nurse though thou art, when I slay the other serving-women in my halls.” Then wise Eurycleia answered him: “My child, what a word has escaped the barrier of thy teeth! Thou knowest how firm my spirit is and unyielding: I shall be as close as hard stone or iron. And another thing will I tell thee, and do thou lay it to heart. If a god shall subdue the lordly wooers unto thee, then will I name over to thee the women in thy halls, which ones dishonor thee, and which are guiltless.” Then Odysseus of many wiles answered her, and said: “Mother, why, pray, wilt thou speak of them? Thou needest not at all. Of myself will I mark them well, and come to know each one. Nay, keep the matter to thyself, and leave the issue to the gods.” So he spoke, and the old woman went forth through the hall to bring water for his feet, for all the first was spilled. And when she had washed him, and anointed him richly with oil, Odysseus again drew his chair nearer to the fire to warm himself, and hid the scar with his rags. Then wise Penelope was the first to speak, saying: “Stranger, this little thing further will I ask thee myself, for it will soon be the hour for pleasant rest, for him at least on whom sweet sleep may come despite his care. But to me has a god given sorrow that is beyond all measure, for day by day I find my joy in mourning and lamenting, while looking to my household tasks and those of my women in the house, but when night comes and sleep lays hold of all, I lie upon my bed, and sharp cares, crowding close about my throbbing heart, disquiet me, as I mourn. Even as when the daughter of Pandareus, the nightingale of the greenwood, sings sweetly, when spring is newly come, as she sits perched amid the thick leafage of the trees, and with many trilling notes pours forth her rich voice in wailing for her child, dear Itylus, whom she had one day slain with the sword unwittingly, Itylus, the son of king Zethus; even so my heart sways to and fro in doubt, whether to abide with my son and keep all things safe, my possessions, my slaves, and my great, high-roofed house, respecting the bed of my husband and the voice of the people, or to go now with him whosoever is best of the Achaeans, who woos me in the halls and offers bride-gifts past counting. Furthermore my son, so long as he was a child and slack of wit, would not suffer me to marry and leave the house of my husband; but now that he is grown and has reached the bounds of manhood, lo, he even prays me to go back again from these halls, being vexed for his substance that the Achaeans devour to his cost. But come now, hear this dream of mine, and interpret it for me. Twenty geese I have in the house that come forth from the water and eat wheat, and my heart warms with joy as I watch them. But forth from the mountain there came a great eagle with crooked beak and broke all their necks and killed them; and they lay strewn in a heap in the halls, while he was borne aloft to the bright sky. Now for my part I wept and wailed, in a dream though it was, and round me thronged the fair-tressed Achaean women, as I grieved piteously because the eagle had slain my geese. Then back he came and perched upon a projecting roof-beam, and with the voice of a mortal man checked my weeping, and said: “‘Be of good cheer, daughter of far-famed Icarius; this is no dream, but a true vision of good which shall verily find fulfillment. The geese are the wooers, and I, that before was the eagle, am now again come back as thy husband, who will let loose a cruel doom upon all the wooers.’ “So he spoke, and sweet sleep released me, and looking about I saw the geese in the halls, feeding on wheat beside the trough, where they had before been wont to feed.” Then Odysseus of many wiles answered her and said: “Lady, in no wise is it possible to wrest this dream aside and give it another meaning, since verily Odysseus himself has shewn thee how he will bring it to pass. For the wooers' destruction is plain to see, for one and all; not one of them shall escape death and the fates.” Then wise Penelope answered him again: “Stranger, dreams verily are baffling and unclear of meaning, and in no wise do they find fulfillment in all things for men. For two are the gates of shadowy dreams, and one is fashioned of horn and one of ivory. Those dreams that pass through the gate of sawn ivory deceive men, bringing words that find no fulfillment. But those that come forth through the gate of polished horn bring true issues to pass, when any mortal sees them. But in my case it was not from thence, methinks, that my strange dream came. Ah, truly it would then have been welcome to me and to my son. But another thing will I tell thee, and do thou lay it to heart. Even now is coming on this morn of evil name which is to cut me off from the house of Odysseus; for now I shall appoint for a contest those axes which he was wont to set up in line in his halls, like props of a ship that is building, twelve in all,	ἄλλην δή τινʼ ἔπειτα Ἀχαιϊάδων εὐπέπλων μνάσθω ἐέδνοισιν διζήμενος· ἡ δέ κʼ ἔπειτα γήμαιθʼ ὅς κε πλεῖστα πόροι καὶ μόρσιμος ἔλθοι. ὣς ἄρʼ ἐφώνησεν καὶ ἀπὸ ἕο τόξον ἔθηκε, κλίνας κολλητῇσιν ἐϋξέστῃς σανίδεσσιν,
and he would stand afar off and shoot an arrow through them. Now then I shall set this contest before the wooers: whosoever shall most easily string the bow in his hands, and shoot an arrow through all twelve axes, with him will I go and forsake this house	αὐτοῦ δʼ ὠκὺ βέλος καλῇ προσέκλινε κορώνῃ, ἂψ δʼ αὖτις κατʼ ἄρ ἕζετʼ ἐπὶ θρόνου ἔνθεν ἀνέστη. Ἀντίνοος δʼ ἐνένιπεν ἔπος τʼ ἔφατʼ ἔκ τʼ ὀνόμαζε· Λειῶδες, ποῖόν σε ἔπος φύγεν ἕρκος ὀδόντων, δεινόν τʼ ἀργαλέον τε, —νεμεσσῶμαι δέ τʼ ἀκούων—
of my wedded life, a house most fair and filled with livelihood, which, methinks, I shall ever remember even in my dreams.” Then Odysseus of many wiles answered her, and said: “Honored wife of Odysseus, son of Laertes, no longer now do thou put off this contest in thy halls;	εἰ δὴ τοῦτό γε τόξον ἀριστῆας κεκαδήσει θυμοῦ καὶ ψυχῆς, ἐπεὶ οὐ δύνασαι σὺ τανύσσαι. οὐ γάρ τοί σέ γε τοῖον ἐγείνατο πότνια μήτηρ οἷόν τε ῥυτῆρα βιοῦ τʼ ἔμεναι καὶ ὀϊστῶν· ἀλλʼ ἄλλοι τανύουσι τάχα μνηστῆρες ἀγαυοί.
for, I tell thee, Odysseus of many wiles will be here, ere these men, handling this polished bow, shall have strung it, and shot an arrow through the iron.” Then wise Penelope answered him: “If thou couldest but wish, stranger, to sit here in my halls	ὣς φάτο, καί ῥʼ ἐκέλευσε Μελάνθιον, αἰπόλον αἰγῶν· ἄγρει δή, πῦρ κῆον ἐνὶ μεγάροισι, Μελανθεῦ, πὰρ δὲ τίθει δίφρον τε μέγαν καὶ κῶας ἐπʼ αὐτοῦ, ἐκ δὲ στέατος ἔνεικε μέγαν τροχὸν ἔνδον ἐόντος, ὄφρα νέοι θάλποντες, ἐπιχρίοντες ἀλοιφῇ,
 and give me joy, sleep should never be shed over my eyelids. But it is in no wise possible that men should forever be sleepless, for the immortals have appointed a proper time for each thing upon the earth, the giver of grain. But I verily will go to my upper chamber	τόξου πειρώμεσθα καὶ ἐκτελέωμεν ἄεθλον. ὣς φάθʼ, ὁ δʼ αἶψʼ ἀνέκαιε Μελάνθιος ἀκάματον πῦρ, πὰρ δὲ φέρων δίφρον θῆκεν καὶ κῶας ἐπʼ αὐτοῦ, ἐκ δὲ στέατος ἔνεικε μέγαν τροχὸν ἔνδον ἐόντος· τῷ ῥα νέοι θάλποντες ἐπειρῶντʼ· οὐδʼ ἐδύναντο
and lay me on my bed, which has become for me a bed of wailings, ever bedewed with my tears, since the day when Odysseus went to see evil Ilios , that should never be named. There will I lay me down, but do thou lie down here in the hall, when thou hast strewn bedding on the floor; or let the maids set a bedstead for thee.”	ἐντανύσαι, πολλὸν δὲ βίης ἐπιδευέες ἦσαν. Ἀντίνοος δʼ ἔτʼ ἐπεῖχε καὶ Εὐρύμαχος θεοειδής, ἀρχοὶ μνηστήρων· ἀρετῇ δʼ ἔσαν ἔξοχʼ ἄριστοι. τὼ δʼ ἐξ οἴκου βῆσαν ὁμαρτήσαντες ἅμʼ ἄμφω βουκόλος ἠδὲ συφορβὸς Ὀδυσσῆος θείοιο·
 So saying, she went up to her bright upper chamber, not alone, for with her went her handmaids as well. And when she had gone up to her upper chamber with her handmaids, she then bewailed Odysseus, her dear husband, until flashing-eyed Athena cast sweet sleep upon her eyelids.	ἐκ δʼ αὐτὸς μετὰ τοὺς δόμου ἤλυθε δῖος Ὀδυσσεύς. ἀλλʼ ὅτε δή ῥʼ ἐκτὸς θυρέων ἔσαν ἠδὲ καὶ αὐλῆς, φθεγξάμενός σφε ἔπεσσι προσηύδα μειλιχίοισι· βουκόλε καὶ σύ, συφορβέ, ἔπος τί κε μυθησαίμην, ἦ αὐτὸς κεύθω; φάσθαι δέ με θυμὸς ἀνώγει.
But the goodly Odysseus lay down to sleep in the fore-hall of the house. On the ground he spread an undressed ox-hide and above it many fleeces of sheep, which the Achaeans were wont to slay, and Eurynome threw over him a cloak, when he had laid him down. There Odysseus, pondering in his heart evil for the wooers, lay sleepless. And the women came forth from the hall, those that had before been wont to lie with the wooers, making laughter and merriment among themselves. But the heart was stirred in his breast, and much he debated in mind and heart, whether he should rush after them and deal death to each, or suffer them to lie with the insolent wooers for the last and latest time; and his heart growled within him. And as a bitch stands over her tender whelps growling, when she sees a man she does not know, and is eager to fight, so his heart growled within him in his wrath at their evil deeds; but he smote his breast, and rebuked his heart, saying: “Endure, my heart; a worse thing even than this didst thou once endure on that day when the Cyclops , unrestrained in daring, devoured my mighty comrades; but thou didst endure until craft got thee forth from the cave where thou thoughtest to die.” So he spoke, chiding the heart in his breast, and his heart remained bound within him to endure steadfastly; but he himself lay tossing this way and that. And as when a man before a great blazing fire turns swiftly this way and that a paunch full of fat and blood, and is very eager to have it roasted quickly, so Odysseus tossed from side to side, pondering how he might put forth his hands upon the shameless wooers, one man as he was against so many. Then Athena came down from heaven and drew near to him in the likeness of a woman, and she stood above his head, and spoke to him, and said: “Why now again art thou wakeful, ill-fated above all men? Lo, this is thy house, and here within is thy wife and thy child, such a man, methinks, as anyone might pray to have for his son.” And Odysseus of many wiles answered her, and said: “Yea, goddess, all this hast thou spoken aright. But the heart in my breast is pondering somewhat upon this, how I may put forth my hands upon the shameless wooers, all alone as I am, while they remain always in a body in the house. And furthermore this other and harder thing I ponder in my mind: even if I were to slay them by the will of Zeus and of thyself, where then should I find escape from bane? Of this I bid thee take thought.” Then the goddess, flashing-eyed Athena, answered him: “Obstinate one, many a man puts his trust even in a weaker friend than I am, one that is mortal, and knows not such wisdom as mine; but I am a god, that guard thee to the end in all thy toils. And I will tell thee openly; if fifty troops of mortal men should stand about us, eager to slay us in battle, even their cattle and goodly sheep shouldest thou drive off. Nay, let sleep now come over thee. There is weariness also in keeping wakeful watch the whole night through; and even now shalt thou come forth from out thy perils.” So she spoke, and shed sleep upon his eyelids, but herself, the fair goddess, went back to Olympus . Now while sleep seized him, loosening the cares of his heart, sleep that loosens the limbs of men, his true-hearted wife awoke, and wept, as she sat upon her soft bed. But when her heart had had its fill of weeping, to Artemis first of all the fair lady made her prayer: “Artemis, mighty goddess, daughter of Zeus, would that now thou wouldest fix thy arrow in my breast and take away my life even in this hour; or that a storm-wind might catch me up and bear me hence over the murky ways, and cast me forth at the mouth of backward-flowing Oceanus, even as on a time storm-winds bore away the daughters of Pandareus. Their parents the gods had slain, and they were left orphans in the halls, and fair Aphrodite tended them with cheese, and sweet honey, and pleasant wine, and Here gave them beauty and wisdom above all women, and chaste Artemis gave them stature, and Athena taught them skill in famous handiwork. But while beautiful Aphrodite was going to high Olympus to ask for the maidens the accomplishment of gladsome marriage— going to Zeus who hurls the thunderbolt, for well he knows all things, both the happiness and the haplessness of mortal men—meanwhile the spirits of the storm snatched away the maidens and gave them to the hateful Erinyes to deal with. Would that even so those who have dwellings on Olympus would blot me from sight, or that fair-tressed Artemis would smite me, so that with Odysseus before my mind I might even pass beneath the hateful earth, and never gladden in any wise the heart of a baser man. Yet when a man weeps by day with a heart sore distressed, but at night sleep holds him, this brings with it an evil that may well be borne—for sleep makes one forget all things, the good and the evil, when once it envelops the eyelids—but upon me a god sends evil dreams as well. For this night again there lay by my side one like him, even such as he was when he went forth with the host, and my heart was glad, for I deemed it was no dream, but the truth at last.” So she spoke, and straightway came golden-throned Dawn. But as she wept goodly Odysseus heard her voice, and thereupon he mused, and it seemed to his heart that she knew him and was standing by his head. Then he gathered up the cloak and the fleeces on which he was lying and laid them on a chair in the hall, and carried the ox-hide out of doors and set it down; and he lifted up his hands and prayed to Zeus: “Father Zeus, if of your good will ye gods have brought me over land and sea to my own country, when ye had afflicted me sore, let some one of those who are awaking utter a word of omen for me within, and without let a sign from Zeus be shown besides.” So he spoke in prayer, and Zeus the counsellor heard him. Straightway he thundered from gleaming Olympus , from on high from out the clouds; and goodly Odysseus was glad. And a woman, grinding at the mill, uttered a word of omen from within the house hard by, where the mills of the shepherd of the people were set. At these mills twelve women in all were wont to ply their tasks, making meal of barley and of wheat, the marrow of men. Now the others were sleeping, for they had ground their wheat, but she alone had not yet ceased, for she was the weakest of all. She now stopped her mill and spoke a word, a sign for her master: “Father Zeus, who art lord over gods and men, verily loud hast thou thundered from the starry sky, yet nowhere is there any cloud: surely this is a sign that thou art showing to some man. Fulfil now even for wretched me the word that I shall speak. May the wooers this day for the last and latest time hold their glad feast in the halls of Odysseus. They that have loosened my limbs with bitter labour, as I made them barley meal, may they now sup their last.” So she spoke, and goodly Odysseus was glad at the word of omen and at the thunder of Zeus, for he thought he had gotten vengeance on the guilty. Now the other maidens in the fair palace of Odysseus had gathered together and were kindling on the hearth unwearied fire, and Telemachus rose from his bed, a godlike man, and put on his clothing. He slung his sharp sword about his shoulder, and beneath his shining feet he bound his fair sandals; and he took his mighty spear, tipped with sharp bronze, and went and stood upon the threshold, and spoke to Eurycleia: “Dear nurse, have ye honored the stranger in our house with bed and food, or does he lie all uncared for? For such is my mother's way, wise though she is: in wondrous fashion she honours one of mortal men, though he be the worse, while the better she sends unhonored away.” Then wise Eurycleia answered him: “In this matter, child, thou shouldest not blame her, who is without blame. He sat here and drank wine as long as he would, but for food he said he had no more hunger, for she asked him. But when he bethought him of rest and sleep, she bade the maidens strew his bed. But he, as one wholly wretched and hapless, would not sleep on a bed and under blankets, but on an undressed ox-hide and fleeces of sheep he slept in the fore-hall, and we flung over him a cloak.” So she spoke, and Telemachus went forth through the hall with his spear in his hand, and with him went two swift hounds. And he went his way to the place of assembly to join the company of the well-greaved Achaeans, but Eurycleia, the goodly lady, daughter of Ops, son of Peisenor, called to her maidens, saying: “Come, let some of you busily sweep the hall and sprinkle it, and throw on the shapely chairs coverlets of purple, and let others wipe all the tables with sponges and cleanse the mixing-bowls and the well-wrought double cups, and others still go to the spring for water and bring it quickly here. For the wooers will not long be absent from the hall, but will return right early; for it is a feast-day for all men.” So she spoke, and they readily hearkened and obeyed. Twenty of them went to the spring of dark water, and the others busied themselves there in the house in skilful fashion. Then in came the serving-men of the Acheans, who thereafter split logs of wood well and skilfully; and the women came back from the spring. After them came the swineherd, driving three boars which were the best in all his herd. These he let be to feed in the fair courts, but himself spoke to Odysseus with gentle words: “Stranger, do the Achaeans look on thee with any more regard, or do they dishonor thee in the halls as before?” Then Odysseus of many wiles answered him, and said: “Ah, Eumaeus, I would that the gods might take vengeance on the outrage wherewith these men in wantonness devise wicked folly in another's house, and have no place for shame.” Thus they spoke to one another. And near to them came Melanthius the goatherd, leading she-goats that were the best in all the herds, to make a feast for the wooers, and two herdsmen followed with him. The goats he tethered beneath the echoing portico, and himself spoke to Odysseus with taunting words: “Stranger, wilt thou even now still be a plague to us here in the hall, asking alms of men, and wilt thou not begone? 'Tis plain, methinks, that we two shall not part company till we taste one another's fists, for thy begging is in no wise decent. Also it is not here alone that there are feasts of the Achaeans.” So he spoke, but Odysseus of many wiles made no answer, but he shook his head in silence, pondering evil in the deep of his heart. Besides these a third man came, Philoetius, a leader of men, driving for the wooers a barren heifer and fat she-goats. These had been brought over from the mainland by ferrymen, who send other men, too, on their way, whosoever comes to them. The beasts he tethered carefully beneath the echoing portico, but himself came close to the swineherd and questioned him, saying: “Who is this stranger, swineherd, who has newly come to our house? From what men does he declare himself to be sprung? Where are his kinsmen and his native fields? Hapless man! Yet truly in form he is like a royal prince; howbeit the gods bring to misery far-wandering men, whenever they spin for them the threads of trouble, even though they be kings.” Therewith he drew near to Odysseus, and stretching forth his right hand in greeting, spoke and addressed him with winged words: “Hail, Sir stranger; may happy fortune be thine in time to come, though now thou art the thrall of many sorrows! Father Zeus, no other god is more baneful than thou; thou hast no pity on men when thou hast thyself given them birth, but bringest them into misery and wretched pains. The sweat broke out on me when I marked the man, and my eyes are full of tears as I think of Odysseus; for he, too, I ween, is clothed in such rags and is a wanderer among men, if indeed he still lives and beholds the light of the sun. But if he is already dead and in the house of Hades, then woe is me for blameless Odysseus, who set me over his cattle, when I was yet a boy, in the land of the Cephallenians And now these wax past counting; in no other wise could the breed of broad-browed cattle yield better increase for a mortal man. But strangers bid me drive these now for themselves to eat, and they care nothing for the son in the house, nor do they tremble at the wrath of the gods, for they are eager now to divide among themselves the possessions of our lord that has long been gone. Now, as for myself, the heart in my breast keeps revolving this matter: a very evil thing it is, while the son lives, to depart along with my cattle and go to a land of strangers, even to an alien folk; but this is worse still, to remain here and suffer woes in charge of cattle that are given over to others. Aye, verily, long ago would I have fled and come to some other of the proud kings, for now things are no more to be borne; but still I think of that hapless one, if perchance he might come back I know not whence, and make a scattering of the wooers in his house.” Then Odysseus of many wiles answered him, and said: “Neatherd, since thou seemest to be neither an evil man nor a witless, and I see for myself that thou hast gotten an understanding heart, therefore will I speak out and swear a great oath to confirm my words. Now be my witness Zeus above all gods, and this hospitable board, and the hearth of noble Odysseus to which I am come, that verily while thou art here Odysseus shall come home, and thou shalt see with thine eyes, if thou wilt, the slaying of the wooers, who lord it here.” Then the herdsman of the cattle answered him: “Ah, stranger, I would that the son of Cronos might fulfil this word of thine! Then shouldest thou know what manner of might is mine, and how my hands obey.” And even in like manner did Eumaeus pray to all the gods that wise Odysseus might come back to his own home. Thus they spoke to one another, but the wooers meanwhile were plotting death and fate for Telemachus; howbeit there came to them a bird on their left, an eagle of lofty flight, clutching a timid dove. Then Amphinomus spoke in their assembly, and said: “Friends, this plan of ours will not run to our liking, even the slaying of Telemachus; nay, let us bethink us of the feast.” So spoke Amphinomus, and his word was pleasing to them. Then, going into the house of godlike Odysseus, they laid their cloaks on the chairs and high seats, and men fell to slaying great sheep and fat goats, aye, and fatted swine, and the heifer of the herd. Then they roasted the entrails and served them out, and mixed wine in the bowls, and the swineherd handed out the cups. And Philoetius, a leader of men, handed them bread in a beautiful basket, and Melanthius poured them wine. So they put forth their hands to the good cheer lying ready before them. But Telemachus, with crafty thought, made Odysseus sit within the well-built hall by the threshold of stone, and placed for him a mean stool and a little table. Beside him he set portions of the entrails and poured wine in a cup of gold, and said to him: “Sit down here among the lords and drink thy wine, and the revilings and blows of all the wooers will I myself ward from thee; for this is no public resort, but the house of Odysseus, and it was for me that he won it. And for your part, ye wooers, refrain your minds from rebukes and blows, that no strife or quarrel may arise.” So he spoke, and they all bit their lips and marvelled at Telemachus for that he spoke boldly; and Antinous, son of Eupeithes, spoke among them, saying: “Hard though it be, Achaeans, let us accept the word of Telemachus, though boldly he threatens us in his speech. For Zeus, son of Cronos, did not suffer it, else would we ere now have silenced him in the halls, clear-voiced talker though he is.” So spoke Antinous, but Telemachus paid no heed to his words. Meanwhile the heralds were leading through the city the holy hecatomb of the gods, and the long-haired Achaeans gathered together beneath a shady grove of Apollo, the archer-god. But when they had roasted the outer flesh and drawn it off the spits, they divided the portions and feasted a glorious feast. And by Odysseus those who served set a portion equal to that which they received themselves, for so Telemachus commanded, the dear son of divine Odysseus. But the proud wooers Athena would in no wise suffer to abstain from bitter outrage, that pain might sink yet deeper into the heart of Odysseus, son of Laertes. There was among the wooers a man with his heart set on lawlessness—Ctesippus was his name, and in Same was his dwelling—who, trusting forsooth in his boundless wealth, wooed the wife of Odysseus, that had long been gone. He it was who now spoke among the haughty wooers: “Hear me, ye proud wooers, that I may say somewhat. A portion has the stranger long had, an equal portion, as is meet; for it is not well nor just to rob of their due the guests of Telemachus, whosoever he be that comes to this house. Nay, come, I too will give him a stranger's-gift, that he in turn may give a present either to the bath-woman or to some other of the slaves who are in the house of godlike Odysseus.” So saying, he hurled with strong hand the hoof of an ox, taking it up from the basket where it lay. But Odysseus avoided it with a quick turn of his head, and in his heart he smiled a right grim and bitter smile; and the ox's hoof struck the well-built wall. Then Telemachus rebuked Ctesippus, and said: “Ctesippus, verily this thing fell out more to thy soul's profit. Thou didst not smite the stranger, for he himself avoided thy missile, else surely would I have struck thee through the middle with my sharp spear, and instead of a wedding feast thy father would have been busied with a funeral feast in this land. Wherefore let no man, I warn you, make a show of forwardness in my house; for now I mark and understand all things, the good and the evil, whereas heretofore I was but a child. But none the less we still endure to see these deeds, while sheep are slaughtered, and wine drunk, and bread consumed, for hard it is for one man to restrain many. Yet come, no longer work me harm of your evil wills. But if you are minded even now to slay me myself with the sword, even that would I choose, and it would be better far to die than continually to behold these shameful deeds, strangers mishandled and men dragging the handmaidens in shameful fashion through the fair hall.” So he spoke, and they were all hushed in silence, but at last there spoke among them Agelaus, son of Damastor: “Friends, no man in answer to what has been fairly spoken would wax wroth and make reply with wrangling words. Abuse not any more the stranger nor any of the slaves that are in the house of divine Odysseus. But to Telemachus and his mother I would speak a gentle word, if perchance it may find favour in the minds of both. So long as the hearts in your breasts had hope that wise Odysseus would return to his own house, so long there was no ground for blame that you waited, and restrained the wooers in your halls; for this was the better course, had Odysseus returned and come back to his house. But now this is plain, that he will return no more. Nay then, come, sit by thy mother and tell her this, namely that she must wed him whosoever is the best man, and who offers the most gifts; to the end that thou mayest enjoy in peace all the heritage of thy fathers, eating and drinking, and that she may keep the house of another.” Then wise Telemachus answered him: “Nay, by Zeus, Agelaus, and by the woes of my father, who somewhere far from Ithaca has perished or is wandering, in no wise do I delay my mother's marriage, but I bid her wed what man she will, and I offer besides gifts past counting. But I am ashamed to drive her forth from the hall against her will by a word of compulsion. May God never bring such a thing to pass.” So spoke Telemachus, but among the wooers Pallas Athena roused unquenchable laughter, and turned their wits awry. And now they laughed with alien lips, and all bedabbled with blood was the flesh they ate, and their eyes were filled with tears and their spirits set on wailing. Then among them spoke godlike Theoclymenus: “Ah, wretched men, what evil is this that you suffer? Shrouded in night are your heads and your faces and your knees beneath you; kindled is the sound of wailing, bathed in tears are your cheeks, and sprinkled with blood are the walls and the fair rafters. And full of ghosts is the porch and full the court, of ghosts that hasten down to Erebus beneath the darkness, and the sun has perished out of heaven and an evil mist hovers over all.” So he spoke, but they all laughed merrily at him. And among them Eurymachus, son of Polybus, was the first to speak: “Mad is the stranger that has newly come from abroad. Quick, ye youths, convey him forth out of doors to go his way to the place of assembly, since here he finds it like night.” Then godlike Theoclymenus answered him: “Eurymachus, in no wise do I bid thee give me guides for my way. I have eyes and ears and my two feet, and a mind in my breast that is in no wise meanly fashioned. With these will I go forth out of doors, for I mark evil coming upon you which not one of the wooers may escape or avoid, of all you who in the house of godlike Odysseus insult men and devise wicked folly.” So saying, he went forth from the stately halls and came to Piraeus, who received him with a ready heart. But all the wooers, looking at one another, sought to provoke Telemachus by laughing at his guests. And thus would one of the proud youths speak: “Telemachus, no man is more unlucky in his guests than thou, seeing that thou keepest such a filthy vagabond as this man here, always wanting bread and wine, and skilled neither in the works of peace nor those of war, but a mere burden of the earth. And this other fellow again stood up to prophesy. Nay, if thou wouldst hearken to me it would be better far: let us fling these strangers on board a benched ship, and send them to the Sicilians, whence they would bring thee in a fitting price.” So spake the wooers, but he paid no heed to their words. Nay, in silence he watched his father, ever waiting until he should put forth his hands upon the shameless wooers. But the daughter of Icarius, wise Penelope, had set her beautiful chair over against them, and heard the words of each man in the hall. For they had made ready their meal in the midst of their laughing, a sweet meal, and one to satisfy the heart, for they had slain many beasts. But never could meal have been more graceless than a supper such as a goddess and a mighty man were soon to set before them. For unprovoked they were contriving deeds of shame.	ποῖοί κʼ εἶτʼ Ὀδυσῆϊ ἀμυνέμεν, εἴ ποθεν ἔλθοι ὧδε μάλʼ ἐξαπίνης καί τις θεὸς αὐτὸν ἐνείκαι; ἤ κε μνηστήρεσσιν ἀμύνοιτʼ ἦ Ὀδυσῆϊ; εἴπαθʼ ὅπως ὑμέας κραδίη θυμός τε κελεύει. τὸν δʼ αὖτε προσέειπε βοῶν ἐπιβουκόλος ἀνήρ·
 She climbed the high stairway to her chamber, and took the bent key in her strong hand—a goodly key of bronze, and on it was a handle of ivory. And she went her way with her handmaidens to a store-room, far remote, where lay the treasures of her lord,	αὐτὰρ ἐπεὶ δὴ τῶν γε νόον νημερτέʼ ἀνέγνω, ἐξαῦτίς σφε ἔπεσσιν ἀμειβόμενος προσέειπεν· ἔνδον μὲν δὴ ὅδʼ αὐτὸς ἐγώ, κακὰ πολλὰ μογήσας ἤλυθον εἰκοστῷ ἔτεϊ ἐς πατρίδα γαῖαν. γιγνώσκω δʼ ὡς σφῶϊν ἐελδομένοισιν ἱκάνω
bronze and gold and iron, wrought with toil. And there lay the back-bent bow and the quiver that held the arrows, and many arrows were in it, fraught with groanings—gifts which a friend of Odysseus had given him when he met him once in Lacedaemon , even Iphitus, son of Eurytus, a man like unto the immortals.	οἴοισι δμώων· τῶν δʼ ἄλλων οὔ τευ ἄκουσα εὐξαμένου ἐμὲ αὖτις ὑπότροπον οἴκαδʼ ἱκέσθαι. σφῶϊν δʼ, ὡς ἔσεταί περ, ἀληθείην καταλέξω. εἴ χʼ ὑπʼ ἐμοί γε θεὸς δαμάσῃ μνηστῆρας ἀγαυούς, ἄξομαι ἀμφοτέροις ἀλόχους καὶ κτήματʼ ὀπάσσω
They two had met one another in Messene in the house of wise Ortilochus. Odysseus verily had come to collect a debt which the whole people owed him, for the men of Messene had lifted from Ithaca in their benched ships three hundred sheep and the shepherds with them.	οἰκία τʼ ἐγγὺς ἐμεῖο τετυγμένα· καί μοι ἔπειτα Τηλεμάχου ἑτάρω τε κασιγνήτω τε ἔσεσθον. εἰ δʼ ἄγε δή, καὶ σῆμα ἀριφραδὲς ἄλλο τι δείξω, ὄφρα μʼ ἐῢ γνῶτον πιστωθῆτόν τʼ ἐνὶ θυμῷ, οὐλήν, τήν ποτέ με σῦς ἤλασε λευκῷ ὀδόντι
 It was on an embassy in quest of these that Odysseus had come a far journey, while he was but a youth; for his father and the other elders had sent him forth. And Iphitus, on his part, had come in search of twelve brood mares, which he had lost, with sturdy mules at the teat; but to him thereafter did they bring death and doom,	Παρνησόνδʼ ἐλθόντα σὺν υἱάσιν Αὐτολύκοιο. ὣς εἰπὼν ῥάκεα μεγάλης ἀποέργαθεν οὐλῆς. τὼ δʼ ἐπεὶ εἰσιδέτην εὖ τʼ ἐφράσσαντο ἕκαστα, κλαῖον ἄρʼ ἀμφʼ Ὀδυσῆϊ δαΐφρονι χεῖρε βαλόντε, καὶ κύνεον ἀγαπαζόμενοι κεφαλήν τε καὶ ὤμους
when he came to the stout-hearted son of Zeus, the man Heracles, who well knew deeds of daring; for Heracles slew him, his guest though he was, in his own house, ruthlessly, and had regard neither for the wrath of the gods nor for the table which he had set before him, but slew the man thereafter,	ὣς δʼ αὔτως Ὀδυσεὺς κεφαλὰς καὶ χεῖρας ἔκυσσε. καί νύ κʼ ὀδυρομένοισιν ἔδυ φάος ἠελίοιο, εἰ μὴ Ὀδυσσεὺς αὐτὸς ἐρύκακε φώνησέν τε· παύεσθον κλαυθμοῖο γόοιό τε, μή τις ἴδηται ἐξελθὼν μεγάροιο, ἀτὰρ εἴπῃσι καὶ εἴσω.
 and himself kept the stout-hoofed mares in his halls. It was while asking for these that Iphitus met Odysseus, and gave him the bow, which of old great Eurytus had been wont to bear, and had left at his death to his son in his lofty house. And to Iphitus Odysseus gave a sharp sword and a mighty spear,	ἀλλὰ προμνηστῖνοι ἐσέλθετε, μηδʼ ἅμα πάντες, πρῶτος ἐγώ, μετὰ δʼ ὔμμες· ἀτὰρ τόδε σῆμα τετύχθω· ἄλλοι μὲν γὰρ πάντες, ὅσοι μνηστῆρες ἀγαυοί, οὐκ ἐάσουσιν ἐμοὶ δόμεναι βιὸν ἠδὲ φαρέτρην· ἀλλὰ σύ, δῖʼ Εὔμαιε, φέρων ἀνὰ δώματα τόξον
 as the beginning of loving friendship; yet they never knew one another at the table, for ere that might be the son of Zeus had slain Iphitus, son of Eurytus, a man like unto the immortals, who gave Odysseus the bow. This bow goodly Odysseus, when going forth to war, would never	ἐν χείρεσσιν ἐμοὶ θέμεναι, εἰπεῖν τε γυναιξὶ κληῗσαι μεγάροιο θύρας πυκινῶς ἀραρυίας, ἢν δέ τις ἢ στοναχῆς ἠὲ κτύπου ἔνδον ἀκούσῃ ἀνδρῶν ἡμετέροισιν ἐν ἕρκεσι, μή τι θύραζε προβλώσκειν, ἀλλʼ αὐτοῦ ἀκὴν ἔμεναι παρὰ ἔργῳ.
take with him on the black ships, but it lay in his halls at home as a memorial of a dear friend, and he carried it in his own land. Now when the fair lady had come to the store-room, and had stepped upon the threshold of oak, which of old the carpenter had skilfully planed and made straight to the line—	σοὶ δέ, Φιλοίτιε δῖε, θύρας ἐπιτέλλομαι αὐλῆς κληῗσαι κληῗδι, θοῶς δʼ ἐπὶ δεσμὸν ἰῆλαι. ὣς εἰπὼν εἰσῆλθε δόμους εὖ ναιετάοντας· ἕζετʼ ἔπειτʼ ἐπὶ δίφρον ἰών, ἔνθεν περ ἀνέστη· ἐς δʼ ἄρα καὶ τὼ δμῶε ἴτην θείου Ὀδυσῆος.
thereon had he also fitted door-posts, and set on them bright doors—straightway she quickly loosed the thong from the handle and thrust in the key, and with sure aim shot back the bolts. And as a bull bellows	Εὐρύμαχος δʼ ἤδη τόξον μετὰ χερσὶν ἐνώμα, θάλπων ἔνθα καὶ ἔνθα σέλᾳ πυρός· ἀλλά μιν οὐδʼ ὣς ἐντανύσαι δύνατο, μέγα δʼ ἔστενε κυδάλιμον κῆρ· ὀχθήσας δʼ ἄρα εἶπεν ἔπος τʼ ἔφατʼ ἔκ τʼ ὀνόμαζεν· ὢ πόποι, ἧ μοι ἄχος περί τʼ αὐτοῦ καὶ περὶ πάντων·
 when grazing in a meadow, even so bellowed the fair doors, smitten by the key; and quickly they flew open before her. Then she stepped upon the high floor, where the chests stood in which fragrant raiment was stored, and stretched out her hand from thence and took from its peg the bow together with the bright case which surrounded it.	οὔ τι γάμου τοσσοῦτον ὀδύρομαι, ἀχνύμενός περ· εἰσὶ καὶ ἄλλαι πολλαὶ Ἀχαιΐδες, αἱ μὲν ἐν αὐτῇ ἀμφιάλῳ Ἰθάκῃ, αἱ δʼ ἄλλῃσιν πολίεσσιν· ἀλλʼ εἰ δὴ τοσσόνδε βίης ἐπιδευέες εἰμὲν ἀντιθέου Ὀδυσῆος, ὅ τʼ οὐ δυνάμεσθα τανύσσαι
 And there she sat down and laid the case upon her knees and wept aloud, and took out the bow of her lord. But when she had had her fill of tearful wailing, she went her way to the hall, to the company of the lordly wooers, bearing in her hands the back-bent bow and the quiver	τόξον· ἐλεγχείη δὲ καὶ ἐσσομένοισι πυθέσθαι. τὸν δʼ αὖτʼ Ἀντίνοος προσέφη, Εὐπείθεος υἱός· Εὐρύμαχʼ, οὐχ οὕτως ἔσται· νοέεις δὲ καὶ αὐτός. νῦν μὲν γὰρ κατὰ δῆμον ἑορτὴ τοῖο θεοῖο ἁγνή· τίς δέ κε τόξα τιταίνοιτʼ; ἀλλὰ ἕκηλοι
 that held the arrows, and many arrows were in it, fraught with groanings. And by her side her maidens bore a chest, wherein lay abundance of iron and bronze, the battle-gear of her lord. Now when the fair lady reached the wooers, she stood by the door-post of the well-built hall,	κάτθετʼ· ἀτὰρ πελέκεάς γε καὶ εἴ κʼ εἰῶμεν ἅπαντας ἑστάμεν· οὐ μὲν γάρ τινʼ ἀναιρήσεσθαι ὀΐω, ἐλθόντʼ ἐς μέγαρον Λαερτιάδεω Ὀδυσῆος. ἀλλʼ ἄγετʼ, οἰνοχόος μὲν ἐπαρξάσθω δεπάεσσιν, ὄφρα σπείσαντες καταθείομεν ἀγκύλα τόξα·
holding before her face her shining veil; and a faithful handmaid stood on either side of her. Then straightway she spoke among the wooers, and said: “Hear me, ye proud wooers, who have beset this house to eat and drink ever without end,	ἠῶθεν δὲ κέλεσθε Μελάνθιον, αἰπόλον αἰγῶν, αἶγας ἄγειν, αἳ πᾶσι μέγʼ ἔξοχοι αἰπολίοισιν, ὄφρʼ ἐπὶ μηρία θέντες Ἀπόλλωνι κλυτοτόξῳ τόξου πειρώμεσθα καὶ ἐκτελέωμεν ἄεθλον. ὣς ἔφατʼ Ἀντίνοος, τοῖσιν δʼ ἐπιήνδανε μῦθος.
since its master has long been gone, nor could you find any other plea to urge, save only as desiring to wed me and take me to wife. Nay, come now, ye wooers, since this is shewn to be your prize. I will set before you the great bow of divine Odysseus,	τοῖσι δὲ κήρυκες μὲν ὕδωρ ἐπὶ χεῖρας ἔχευαν, κοῦροι δὲ κρητῆρας ἐπεστέψαντο ποτοῖο, νώμησαν δʼ ἄρα πᾶσιν ἐπαρξάμενοι δεπάεσσιν. οἱ δʼ ἐπεὶ οὖν σπεῖσάν τʼ ἔπιόν θʼ ὅσον ἤθελε θυμός, τοῖς δὲ δολοφρονέων μετέφη πολύμητις Ὀδυσσεύς·
and whosoever shall most easily string the bow in his hands and shoot an arrow through all twelve axes, with him will I go, and forsake this house of my wedded life, a house most fair and filled with livelihood, which, methinks I shall ever remember even in my dreams.”	κέκλυτέ μευ, μνηστῆρες ἀγακλειτῆς βασιλείης· ὄφρʼ εἴπω τά με θυμὸς ἐνὶ στήθεσσι κελεύει· Εὐρύμαχον δὲ μάλιστα καὶ Ἀντίνοον θεοειδέα λίσσομʼ, ἐπεὶ καὶ τοῦτο ἔπος κατὰ μοῖραν ἔειπε, νῦν μὲν παῦσαι τόξον, ἐπιτρέψαι δὲ θεοῖσιν·
So she spoke, and bade Eumaeus, the goodly swineherd, set for the wooers the bow and the grey iron. And, bursting into tears, Eumaeus took them and laid them down, and in another place the neatherd wept, when he saw the bow of his lord. Then Antinous rebuked them, and spoke, and addressed them:	ἠῶθεν δὲ θεὸς δώσει κράτος ᾧ κʼ ἐθέλῃσιν. ἀλλʼ ἄγʼ ἐμοὶ δότε τόξον ἐΰξοον, ὄφρα μεθʼ ὑμῖν χειρῶν καὶ σθένεος πειρήσομαι, ἤ μοι ἔτʼ ἐστὶν ἴς, οἵη πάρος ἔσκεν ἐνὶ γναμπτοῖσι μέλεσσιν, ἦ ἤδη μοι ὄλεσσεν ἄλη τʼ ἀκομιστίη τε.
 “Foolish boors, who mind only the things of the day! Wretched pair, why now do you shed tears, and trouble the soul in the breast of the lady, whose heart even as it is lies low in pain, seeing that she has lost her dear husband? Nay, sit and feast in silence,	ὣς ἔφαθʼ, οἱ δʼ ἄρα πάντες ὑπερφιάλως νεμέσησαν, δείσαντες μὴ τόξον ἐΰξοον ἐντανύσειεν. Ἀντίνοος δʼ ἐνένιπεν ἔπος τʼ ἔφατʼ ἔκ τʼ ὀνόμαζεν· ἆ δειλὲ ξείνων, ἔνι τοι φρένες οὐδʼ ἠβαιαί· οὐκ ἀγαπᾷς ὃ ἕκηλος ὑπερφιάλοισι μεθʼ ἡμῖν
or else go forth and weep, and leave the bow here behind as a decisive contest for the wooers; for not easily, methinks, is this polished bow to be strung. For there is no man among all these here such as Odysseus was, and I myself saw him.	δαίνυσαι, οὐδέ τι δαιτὸς ἀμέρδεαι, αὐτὰρ ἀκούεις μύθων ἡμετέρων καὶ ῥήσιος; οὐδέ τις ἄλλος ἡμετέρων μύθων ξεῖνος καὶ πτωχὸς ἀκούει. οἶνός σε τρώει μελιηδής, ὅς τε καὶ ἄλλους βλάπτει, ὃς ἄν μιν χανδὸν ἕλῃ μηδʼ αἴσιμα πίνῃ.
For I remember him, though I was still but a child.” So he spoke, but the heart in his breast hoped that he would string the bow and shoot an arrow through the iron. Yet verily he was to be the first to taste of an arrow from the hands of noble Odysseus, whom then he,	οἶνος καὶ Κένταυρον, ἀγακλυτὸν Εὐρυτίωνα, ἄασʼ ἐνὶ μεγάρῳ μεγαθύμου Πειριθόοιο, ἐς Λαπίθας ἐλθόνθʼ· ὁ δʼ ἐπεὶ φρένας ἄασεν οἴνῳ, μαινόμενος κάκʼ ἔρεξε δόμον κάτα Πειριθόοιο· ἥρωας δʼ ἄχος εἷλε, διὲκ προθύρου δὲ θύραζε
as he sat in the halls, was dishonoring, and urging on all his comrades. Then among them spoke the strong and mighty Telemachus: “Lo now, of a truth Zeus, son of Cronos, has made me witless. My dear mother, for all that she is wise, declares that she will follow another lord, forsaking this house;	ἕλκον ἀναΐξαντες, ἀπʼ οὔατα νηλέϊ χαλκῷ ῥῖνάς τʼ ἀμήσαντες· ὁ δὲ φρεσὶν ᾗσιν ἀασθεὶς ἤϊεν ἣν ἄτην ὀχέων ἀεσίφρονι θυμῷ. ἐξ οὗ Κενταύροισι καὶ ἀνδράσι νεῖκος ἐτύχθη, οἷ δʼ αὐτῷ πρώτῳ κακὸν εὕρετο οἰνοβαρείων.
yet I laugh, and am glad with a witless mind. Come then, ye wooers, since this is shewn to be your prize, a lady, the like of whom is not now in the Achaean land, neither in sacred Pylos , nor in Argos , nor in Mycene, nor yet in Ithaca itself, nor in the dark mainland.	ὣς καὶ σοὶ μέγα πῆμα πιφαύσκομαι, αἴ κε τὸ τόξον ἐντανύσῃς· οὐ γάρ τευ ἐπητύος ἀντιβολήσεις ἡμετέρῳ ἐνὶ δήμῳ, ἄφαρ δέ σε νηῒ μελαίνῃ εἰς Ἔχετον βασιλῆα, βροτῶν δηλήμονα πάντων, πέμψομεν· ἔνθεν δʼ οὔ τι σαώσεαι· ἀλλὰ ἕκηλος
Nay, but of yourselves you know this—what need have I to praise my mother? Come then, put not the matter aside with excuses, nor any more turn away too long from the drawing of the bow, that we may see the issue. Yea, and I would myself make trial of yon bow. If I shall string it and shoot an arrow through the iron,	πῖνέ τε, μηδʼ ἐρίδαινε μετʼ ἀνδράσι κουροτέροισιν. τὸν δʼ αὖτε προσέειπε περίφρων Πηνελόπεια· Ἀντίνοʼ, οὐ μὲν καλὸν ἀτέμβειν οὐδὲ δίκαιον ξείνους Τηλεμάχου, ὅς κεν τάδε δώμαθʼ ἵκηται· ἔλπεαι, αἴ χʼ ὁ ξεῖνος Ὀδυσσῆος μέγα τόξον
it will not vex me that my honored mother should leave this house and go along with another, seeing that I should be left here able now to wield the goodly battle-gear of my father.” With this he flung the scarlet cloak from off his back, and sprang up erect; and he laid his sharp sword from off his shoulders.	ἐντανύσῃ χερσίν τε βίηφί τε ἧφι πιθήσας, οἴκαδέ μʼ ἄξεσθαι καὶ ἑὴν θήσεσθαι ἄκοιτιν; οὐδʼ αὐτός που τοῦτό γʼ ἐνὶ στήθεσσιν ἔολπε· μηδέ τις ὑμείων τοῦ γʼ εἵνεκα θυμὸν ἀχεύων ἐνθάδε δαινύσθω, ἐπεὶ οὐδὲ μὲν οὐδὲ ἔοικεν.
 First then he set up the axes, when he had dug a trench, one long trench for all, and made it straight to the line, and about them he stamped in the earth. And amazement seized all who saw him, that he set them out so orderly, though before he had never seen them. Then he went and stood upon the threshold, and began to try the bow.	τὴν δʼ αὖτʼ Εὐρύμαχος, Πολύβου πάϊς, ἀντίον ηὔδα· κούρη Ἰκαρίοιο, περίφρον Πηνελόπεια, οὔ τί σε τόνδʼ ἄξεσθαι ὀϊόμεθʼ· οὐδὲ ἔοικεν· ἀλλʼ αἰσχυνόμενοι φάτιν ἀνδρῶν ἠδὲ γυναικῶν, μή ποτέ τις εἴπῃσι κακώτερος ἄλλος Ἀχαιῶν
 Thrice he made it quiver in his eagerness to draw it, and thrice he relaxed his effort, though in his heart he hoped to string the bow and shoot an arrow through the iron. And now at the last he would haply have strung it in his might, as for the fourth time he sought to draw up the string, but Odysseus nodded in dissent, and checked him in his eagerness.	ἦ πολὺ χείρονες ἄνδρες ἀμύμονος ἀνδρὸς ἄκοιτιν μνῶνται, οὐδέ τι τόξον ἐΰξοον ἐντανύουσιν· ἀλλʼ ἄλλος τις πτωχὸς ἀνὴρ ἀλαλήμενος ἐλθὼν ῥηϊδίως ἐτάνυσσε βιόν, διὰ δʼ ἧκε σιδήρου. ὣς ἐρέουσʼ, ἡμῖν δʼ ἂν ἐλέγχεα ταῦτα γένοιτο.
Then the strong and mighty Telemachus spoke among them again: “Out on it, even in days to come shall I be a coward and a weakling, or else I am too young, and have not yet trust in my might to defend me against a man, when one waxes wroth without a cause. But, come now, you that are mightier than I,	τὸν δʼ αὖτε προσέειπε περίφρων Πηνελόπεια· Εὐρύμαχʼ, οὔ πως ἔστιν ἐϋκλεῖας κατὰ δῆμον ἔμμεναι οἳ δὴ οἶκον ἀτιμάζοντες ἔδουσιν ἀνδρὸς ἀριστῆος· τί δʼ ἐλέγχεα ταῦτα τίθεσθε; οὗτος δὲ ξεῖνος μάλα μὲν μέγας ἠδʼ εὐπηγής,
make trial of the bow, and let us end the contest.” So saying, he set the bow from him on the ground, leaning it against the jointed, polished door, and hard by he leaned the swift arrow against the fair bow-tip, and then sat down again on the seat from which he had risen.	πατρὸς δʼ ἐξ ἀγαθοῦ γένος εὔχεται ἔμμεναι υἱός. ἀλλʼ ἄγε οἱ δότε τόξον ἐΰξοον, ὄφρα ἴδωμεν. ὧδε γὰρ ἐξερέω, τὸ δὲ καὶ τετελεσμένον ἔσται· εἴ κέ μιν ἐντανύσῃ, δώῃ δέ οἱ εὖχος Ἀπόλλων, ἕσσω μιν χλαῖνάν τε χιτῶνά τε, εἵματα καλά,
Then Antinous, son of Eupeithes, spoke among them: “Rise up in order, all you of our company, from left to right, beginning from the place where the cupbearer pours the wine.” So spoke Antinous, and his word was pleasing to them. Then first arose Leiodes, son of Oenops,	δώσω δʼ ὀξὺν ἄκοντα, κυνῶν ἀλκτῆρα καὶ ἀνδρῶν, καὶ ξίφος ἄμφηκες· δώσω δʼ ὑπὸ ποσσὶ πέδιλα, πέμψω δʼ ὅππη μιν κραδίη θυμός τε κελεύει. τὴν δʼ αὖ Τηλέμαχος πεπνυμένος ἀντίον ηὔδα· μῆτερ ἐμή, τόξον μὲν Ἀχαιῶν οὔ τις ἐμεῖο
 who was their soothsayer, and ever sat by the fair mixing-bowl in the innermost part of the hall; deeds of wanton folly were hateful to him alone, and he was full of indignation at all the wooers. He it was who now first took the bow and swift arrow, and he went and stood upon the threshold, and began to try the bow;	κρείσσων, ᾧ κʼ ἐθέλω, δόμεναί τε καὶ ἀρνήσασθαι, οὔθʼ ὅσσοι κραναὴν Ἰθάκην κάτα κοιρανέουσιν, οὔθʼ ὅσσοι νήσοισι πρὸς Ἤλιδος ἱπποβότοιο· τῶν οὔ τίς μʼ ἀέκοντα βιήσεται, αἴ κʼ ἐθέλωμι καὶ καθάπαξ ξείνῳ δόμεναι τάδε τόξα φέρεσθαι.
but he could not string it. Ere that might be his hands grew weary, as he sought to draw up the string, his unworn delicate hands; and he spoke among the wooers: “Friends, it is not I that shall string it; let another take it. For many princes shall this bow rob of spirit and of life, since verily it is better far	ἀλλʼ εἰς οἶκον ἰοῦσα τὰ σʼ αὐτῆς ἔργα κόμιζε, ἱστόν τʼ ἠλακάτην τε, καὶ ἀμφιπόλοισι κέλευε ἔργον ἐποίχεσθαι· τόξον δʼ ἄνδρεσσι μελήσει πᾶσι, μάλιστα δʼ ἐμοί· τοῦ γὰρ κράτος ἔστʼ ἐνὶ οἴκῳ. ἡ μὲν θαμβήσασα πάλιν οἶκόνδε βεβήκει·
 to die than to live on and fail of that for the sake of which we ever gather here, waiting expectantly day after day. Now many a man even hopes in his heart and desires to wed Penelope, the wife of Odysseus; but when he shall have made trial of the bow, and seen the outcome, thereafter let him woo	παιδὸς γὰρ μῦθον πεπνυμένον ἔνθετο θυμῷ. ἐς δʼ ὑπερῷʼ ἀναβᾶσα σὺν ἀμφιπόλοισι γυναιξὶ κλαῖεν ἔπειτʼ Ὀδυσῆα, φίλον πόσιν, ὄφρα οἱ ὕπνον ἡδὺν ἐπὶ βλεφάροισι βάλε γλαυκῶπις Ἀθήνη. αὐτὰρ ὁ τόξα λαβὼν φέρε καμπύλα δῖος ὑφορβός·
some other of the fair-robed Achaean women with his gifts, and seek to win her; then should Penelope wed him who offers most, and who comes as her fated lord.” So he spoke, and set the bow from him, leaning it against the jointed, polished door,	μνηστῆρες δʼ ἄρα πάντες ὁμόκλεον ἐν μεγάροισιν· ὧδε δέ τις εἴπεσκε νέων ὑπερηνορεόντων· πῆ δὴ καμπύλα τόξα φέρεις, ἀμέγαρτε συβῶτα, πλαγκτέ; τάχʼ αὖ σʼ ἐφʼ ὕεσσι κύνες ταχέες κατέδονται οἶον ἀπʼ ἀνθρώπων, οὓς ἔτρεφες, εἴ κεν Ἀπόλλων
 and hard by he leaned the swift arrow against the fair bow-tip, and then sat down on the seat from which he had risen. But Antinous rebuked him, and spoke, and addressed him: “Leiodes, what a word has escaped the barrier of thy teeth, a dread word and grievous! I am angered to hear it,	ἡμῖν ἱλήκῃσι καὶ ἀθάνατοι θεοὶ ἄλλοι. ὣς φάσαν, αὐτὰρ, ὁ θῆκε φέρων αὐτῇ ἐνὶ χώρῃ, δείσας, οὕνεκα πολλοὶ ὁμόκλεον ἐν μεγάροισιν. Τηλέμαχος δʼ ἑτέρωθεν ἀπειλήσας ἐγεγώνει· ἄττα, πρόσω φέρε τόξα· τάχʼ οὐκ εὖ πᾶσι πιθήσεις
if forsooth this bow is to rob princes of spirit and of life, because thou art not able to string it. For, I tell thee, thy honored mother did not bear thee of such strength as to draw a bow and shoot arrows; but others of the lordly wooers will soon string it.”	μή σε καὶ ὁπλότερός περ ἐὼν ἀγρόνδε δίωμαι, βάλλων χερμαδίοισι· βίηφι δὲ φέρτερός εἰμι. αἲ γὰρ πάντων τόσσον, ὅσοι κατὰ δώματʼ ἔασι, μνηστήρων χερσίν τε βίηφί τε φέρτερος εἴην· τῷ κε τάχα στυγερῶς τινʼ ἐγὼ πέμψαιμι νέεσθαι
 So he spoke, and called to Melanthius, the goatherd: “Come now, light a fire in the hall, Melanthius; and set by it a great seat with a fleece upon it, and bring forth a great cake of the fat that is within, that we youths may warm the bow, and anoint it with fat,	ἡμετέρου ἐξ οἴκου, ἐπεὶ κακὰ μηχανόωνται. ὣς ἔφαθʼ, οἱ δʼ ἄρα πάντες ἐπʼ αὐτῷ ἡδὺ γέλασσαν μνηστῆρες, καὶ δὴ μέθιεν χαλεποῖο χόλοιο Τηλεμάχῳ· τὰ δὲ τόξα φέρων ἀνὰ δῶμα συβώτης ἐν χείρεσσʼ Ὀδυσῆϊ δαΐφρονι θῆκε παραστάς.
and so make trial of it, and end the contest.” So he spoke, and Melanthius straightway rekindled the unwearied fire, and brought and placed by it a great seat with a fleece upon it, and he brought forth a great cake of the fat that was within. Therewith the youths warmed the bow, and made trial of it, but they could not	ἐκ δὲ καλεσσάμενος προσέφη τροφὸν Εὐρύκλειαν· Τηλέμαχος κέλεταί σε, περίφρων Εὐρύκλεια, κληῗσαι μεγάροιο θύρας πυκινῶς ἀραρυίας. ἢν δέ τις ἤ στοναχῆς ἠὲ κτύπου ἔνδον ἀκούσῃ ἀνδρῶν ἡμετέροισιν ἐν ἕρκεσι, μή τι θύραζε
string it, for they were far lacking in strength. Now Antinous was still persisting and godlike Eurymachus, leaders of the wooers, who were far the best in valiance; but those other two had gone forth both together from the hall, the neatherd and the swineherd of divine Odysseus;	προβλώσκειν, ἀλλʼ αὐτοῦ ἀκὴν ἔμεναι παρὰ ἔργῳ. ὣς ἄρʼ ἐφώνησεν, τῇ δʼ ἄπτερος ἔπλετο μῦθος, κλήϊσεν δὲ θύρας μεγάρων εὖ ναιεταόντων. σιγῇ δʼ ἐξ οἴκοιο Φιλοίτιος ἆλτο θύραζε, κλήϊσεν δʼ ἄρʼ ἔπειτα θύρας εὐερκέος αὐλῆς.
and after them Odysseus himself went forth from the house. But when they were now outside the gates and the court, he spoke and addressed them with gentle words: “Neatherd, and thou too swineherd, shall I tell you something or keep it to myself? Nay, my spirit bids me tell it.	κεῖτο δʼ ὑπʼ αἰθούσῃ ὅπλον νεὸς ἀμφιελίσσης βύβλινον, ᾧ ῥʼ ἐπέδησε θύρας, ἐς δʼ ἤϊεν αὐτός· ἕζετʼ ἔπειτʼ ἐπὶ δίφρον ἰών, ἔνθεν περ ἀνέστη, εἰσορόων Ὀδυσῆα. ὁ δʼ ἤδη τόξον ἐνώμα πάντη ἀναστρωφῶν, πειρώμενος ἔνθα καὶ ἔνθα,
What manner of men would you be to defend Odysseus, if he should come from somewhere thus suddenly, and some god should bring him? Would you bear aid to the wooers or to Odysseus? Speak out as your heart and spirit bid you.” Then the herdsmen of the cattle answered him:	μὴ κέρα ἶπες ἔδοιεν ἀποιχομένοιο ἄνακτος. ὧδε τις εἴπεσκεν ἰδὼν ἐς πλησίον ἄλλον· ἦ τις θηητὴρ καὶ ἐπίκλοπος ἔπλετο τόξων· ἤ ῥά νύ που τοιαῦτα καὶ αὐτῷ οἴκοθι κεῖται ἢ ὅ γʼ ἐφορμᾶται ποιησέμεν, ὡς ἐνὶ χερσὶ
“Father Zeus, oh that thou wouldest fulfil this wish! Grant that that man may come back, and that some god may guide him. Then shouldest thou know what manner of might is mine, and how my hands obey.” And even in like manner did Eumaeus pray to all the gods that wise Odysseus; might come back to his own home.	νωμᾷ ἔνθα καὶ ἔνθα κακῶν ἔμπαιος ἀλήτης. ἄλλος δʼ αὖ εἴπεσκε νέων ὑπερηνορεόντων· αἲ γὰρ δὴ τοσσοῦτον ὀνήσιος ἀντιάσειεν ὡς οὗτός ποτε τοῦτο δυνήσεται ἐντανύσασθαι. ὣς ἄρʼ ἔφαν μνηστῆρες· ἀτὰρ πολύμητις Ὀδυσσεύς,
But when he knew with certainty the mind of these, he made answer, and spoke to them again, saying: “At home now in truth am I here before you, my very self. After many grievous toils I am come in the twentieth year to my native land. And I know that by you two	αὐτίκʼ ἐπεὶ μέγα τόξον ἐβάστασε καὶ ἴδε πάντη, ὡς ὅτʼ ἀνὴρ φόρμιγγος ἐπιστάμενος καὶ ἀοιδῆς ῥηϊδίως ἐτάνυσσε νέῳ περὶ κόλλοπι χορδήν, ἅψας ἀμφοτέρωθεν ἐϋστρεφὲς ἔντερον οἰός, ὣς ἄρʼ ἄτερ σπουδῆς τάνυσεν μέγα τόξον Ὀδυσσεύς.
 alone of all my thralls is my coming desired, but of the rest have I heard not one praying that I might come back again to my home. But to you two will I tell the truth, even as it shall be. If a god shall subdue the lordly wooers unto me, I will bring you each a wife, and will give you possessions	δεξιτερῇ ἄρα χειρὶ λαβὼν πειρήσατο νευρῆς· ἡ δʼ ὑπὸ καλὸν ἄεισε, χελιδόνι εἰκέλη αὐδήν. μνηστῆρσιν δʼ ἄρʼ ἄχος γένετο μέγα, πᾶσι δʼ ἄρα χρὼς ἐτράπετο· Ζεὺς δὲ μεγάλʼ ἔκτυπε σήματα φαίνων· γήθησέν τʼ ἄρʼ ἔπειτα πολύτλας δῖος Ὀδυσσεύς.
 and a house built near my own, and thereafter you two shall be in my eyes friends and brothers of Telemachus. Nay, come, more than this, I will shew you also a manifest sign, that you may know me well and be assured in heart, even the scar of the wound which long ago a boar dealt me with his white tusk,	ὅττι ῥά οἱ τέρας ἧκε Κρόνου πάϊς ἀγκυλομήτεω· εἵλετο δʼ ὠκὺν ὀϊστόν, ὅ οἱ παρέκειτο τραπέζῃ γυμνός· τοὶ δʼ ἄλλοι κοίλης ἔντοσθε φαρέτρης κείατο, τῶν τάχʼ ἔμελλον Ἀχαιοὶ πειρήσεσθαι. τόν ῥʼ ἐπὶ πήχει ἑλὼν ἕλκεν νευρὴν γλυφίδας τε,
when I went to Parnassus with the sons of Autolycus.” So saying, he drew aside the rags from the great scar. And when the two had seen it, and had marked each thing well, they flung their arms about wise Odysseus, and wept; and they kissed his head and shoulders in loving welcome.	αὐτόθεν ἐκ δίφροιο καθήμενος, ἧκε δʼ ὀϊστὸν ἄντα τιτυσκόμενος, πελέκεων δʼ οὐκ ἤμβροτε πάντων πρώτης στειλειῆς, διὰ δʼ ἀμπερὲς ἦλθε θύραζε ἰὸς χαλκοβαρής· ὁ δὲ Τηλέμαχον προσέειπε· Τηλέμαχʼ, οὔ σʼ ὁ ξεῖνος ἐνὶ μεγάροισιν ἐλέγχει
And even in like manner Odysseus kissed their heads and hands. And now the light of the sun would have gone down upon their weeping, had not Odysseus himself checked them, and said: “Cease now from weeping and wailing, lest some one come forth from the hall and see us, and make it known within as well.	ἥμενος, οὐδέ τι τοῦ σκοποῦ ἤμβροτον οὐδέ τι τόξον δὴν ἔκαμον τανύων· ἔτι μοι μένος ἔμπεδόν ἐστιν, οὐχ ὥς με μνηστῆρες ἀτιμάζοντες ὄνονται. νῦν δʼ ὥρη καὶ δόρπον Ἀχαιοῖσιν τετυκέσθαι ἐν φάει, αὐτὰρ ἔπειτα καὶ ἄλλως ἑψιάασθαι
 But go within one after another, not all together, I first and you thereafter, and let this be made a sign. All the rest, as many as are lordly wooers, will not suffer the bow and the quiver to be given to me; but do thou, goodly Eumaeus, as thou bearest the bow through the halls,	μολπῇ καὶ φόρμιγγι· τὰ γάρ τʼ ἀναθήματα δαιτός. ἦ καὶ ἐπʼ ὀφρύσι νεῦσεν· ὁ δʼ ἀμφέθετο ξίφος ὀξὺ Τηλέμαχος, φίλος υἱὸς Ὀδυσσῆος θείοιο, ἀμφὶ δὲ χεῖρα φίλην βάλεν ἔγχεϊ, ἄγχι δʼ ἄρʼ αὐτοῦ πὰρ θρόνον ἑστήκει κεκορυθμένος αἴθοπι χαλκῷ.
But to thee, goodly Philoetius, do I give charge to fasten with a bar the gate of the court, and swiftly to cast a cord upon it.” So saying, he entered the stately house, and went and sat down on the seat from which he had risen. And the two slaves of divine Odysseus went in as well.	αὐτὰρ ὁ γυμνώθη ῥακέων πολύμητις Ὀδυσσεύς, ἆλτο δʼ ἐπὶ μέγαν οὐδόν, ἔχων βιὸν ἠδὲ φαρέτρην ἰῶν ἐμπλείην, ταχέας δʼ ἐκχεύατʼ ὀϊστοὺς αὐτοῦ πρόσθε ποδῶν, μετὰ δὲ μνηστῆρσιν ἔειπεν·
Eurymachus was now handling the bow, warming it on this side and on that in the light of the fire; but not even so was he able to string it; and in his noble heart he groaned, and with a burst of anger he spoke and addressed them: “Out on it! Verily I am grieved for myself and for you all.	οὗτος μὲν δὴ ἄεθλος ἀάατος ἐκτετέλεσται· νῦν αὖτε σκοπὸν ἄλλον, ὃν οὔ πώ τις βάλεν ἀνήρ, εἴσομαι, αἴ κε τύχωμι, πόρῃ δέ μοι εὖχος Ἀπόλλων. ἦ καὶ ἐπʼ Ἀντινόῳ ἰθύνετο πικρὸν ὀϊστόν. ἦ τοι ὁ καλὸν ἄλεισον ἀναιρήσεσθαι ἔμελλε,
It is in no wise for the marriage that I mourn so greatly, grieved though I am; for there are many other Achaean women, some in sea-girt Ithaca itself, and some in other cities; but I mourn if in truth we fall so far short of godlike Odysseus in might, seeing that we cannot string	χρύσεον ἄμφωτον, καὶ δὴ μετὰ χερσὶν ἐνώμα, ὄφρα πίοι οἴνοιο· φόνος δέ οἱ οὐκ ἐνὶ θυμῷ μέμβλετο· τίς κʼ οἴοιτο μετʼ ἀνδράσι δαιτυμόνεσσι μοῦνον ἐνὶ πλεόνεσσι, καὶ εἰ μάλα καρτερὸς εἴη, οἷ τεύξειν θάνατόν τε κακὸν καὶ κῆρα μέλαιναν;
his bow. This is a reproach for men that are yet to be to hear of.” Then Antinous, son of Eupeithes, answered him: “Eurymachus, this shall not be so, and thou of thyself too knowest it. For to-day throughout the land is the feast of the god —a holy feast. Who then would bend a bow? Nay, quietly	τὸν δʼ Ὀδυσεὺς κατὰ λαιμὸν ἐπισχόμενος βάλεν ἰῷ, ἀντικρὺ δʼ ἁπαλοῖο διʼ αὐχένος ἤλυθʼ ἀκωκή. ἐκλίνθη δʼ ἑτέρωσε, δέπας δέ οἱ ἔκπεσε χειρὸς βλημένου, αὐτίκα δʼ αὐλὸς ἀνὰ ῥῖνας παχὺς ἦλθεν αἵματος ἀνδρομέοιο· θοῶς δʼ ἀπὸ εἷο τράπεζαν
 set it by; and as for the axes—what if we should let them all stand as they are? No man, methinks, will come to the hall of Odysseus, son of Laertes, and carry them off. Nay, come, let the bearer pour drops for libation into the cups, that we may pour libations, and lay aside the curved bow.	ὦσε ποδὶ πλήξας, ἀπὸ δʼ εἴδατα χεῦεν ἔραζε· σῖτός τε κρέα τʼ ὀπτὰ φορύνετο. τοὶ δʼ ὁμάδησαν μνηστῆρες κατὰ δώμαθʼ, ὅπως ἴδον ἄνδρα πεσόντα, ἐκ δὲ θρόνων ἀνόρουσαν ὀρινθέντες κατὰ δῶμα, πάντοσε παπταίνοντες ἐϋδμήτους ποτὶ τοίχους·
And in the morning bid Melanthius, the goatherd, to bring she-goats, far the best in all the herds, that we may lay thigh-pieces on the altar of Apollo, the famed archer; and so make trial of the bow, and end the contest.” So spoke Antinous, and his word was pleasing to them.	οὐδέ πη ἀσπὶς ἔην οὐδʼ ἄλκιμον ἔγχος ἑλέσθαι. νείκειον δʼ Ὀδυσῆα χολωτοῖσιν ἐπέεσσι· ξεῖνε, κακῶς ἀνδρῶν τοξάζεαι· οὐκέτʼ ἀέθλων ἄλλων ἀντιάσεις· νῦν τοι σῶς αἰπὺς ὄλεθρος. καὶ γὰρ δὴ νῦν φῶτα κατέκτανες ὃς μέγʼ ἄριστος
Then the heralds poured water over their hands, and youths filled the bowls brim full of drink, and served out to all, pouring first drops for libation into the cups. But when they had poured libations, and had drunk to their heart's content, then with crafty mind Odysseus of many wiles spoke among them:	κούρων εἰν Ἰθάκῃ· τῷ σʼ ἐνθάδε γῦπες ἔδονται. ἴσκεν ἕκαστος ἀνήρ, ἐπεὶ ἦ φάσαν οὐκ ἐθέλοντα ἄνδρα κατακτεῖναι· τὸ δὲ νήπιοι οὐκ ἐνόησαν, ὡς δή σφιν καὶ πᾶσιν ὀλέθρου πείρατʼ ἐφῆπτο. τοὺς δʼ ἄρʼ ὑπόδρα ἰδὼν προσέφη πολύμητις Ὀδυσσεύς·
 “Hear me, wooers of the glorious queen, that I may say what the heart in my breast bids me. To Eurymachus most of all do I make my prayer, and to godlike Antinous, since this word also of his was spoken aright, namely that for the present you cease to try the bow, and leave the issue with the gods;	ὦ κύνες, οὔ μʼ ἔτʼ ἐφάσκεθʼ ὑπότροπον οἴκαδʼ ἱκέσθαι δήμου ἄπο Τρώων, ὅτι μοι κατεκείρετε οἶκον, δμῳῇσιν δὲ γυναιξὶ παρευνάζεσθε βιαίως, αὐτοῦ τε ζώοντος ὑπεμνάασθε γυναῖκα, οὔτε θεοὺς δείσαντες, οἳ οὐρανὸν εὐρὺν ἔχουσιν,
and in the morning the god will give the victory to whomsoever he will. But come, give me the polished bow, that in your midst I may prove my hands and strength, whether I have yet might such as was of old in my supple limbs, or whether by now my wanderings and lack of food have destroyed it.”	οὔτε τινʼ ἀνθρώπων νέμεσιν κατόπισθεν ἔσεσθαι· νῦν ὑμῖν καὶ πᾶσιν ὀλέθρου πείρατʼ ἐφῆπται. ὣς φάτο, τοὺς δʼ ἄρα πάντας ὑπὸ χλωρὸν δέος εἷλεν· πάπτηνεν δὲ ἕκαστος ὅπη φύγοι αἰπὺν ὄλεθρον. Εὐρύμαχος δέ μιν οἶος ἀμειβόμενος προσέειπεν·
So he spoke, and they all waxed exceeding wroth, fearing lest he might string the polished bow. And Antinous rebuked him, and spoke and addressed him: “Ah, wretched stranger, thou hast no wit, no, not a trace. Art thou not content	εἰ μὲν δὴ Ὀδυσεὺς Ἰθακήσιος εἰλήλουθας, ταῦτα μὲν αἴσιμα εἶπας, ὅσα ῥέζεσκον Ἀχαιοί, πολλὰ μὲν ἐν μεγάροισιν ἀτάσθαλα, πολλὰ δʼ ἐπʼ ἀγροῦ. ἀλλʼ ὁ μὲν ἤδη κεῖται ὃς αἴτιος ἔπλετο πάντων, Ἀντίνοος· οὗτος γὰρ ἐπίηλεν τάδε ἔργα,
 that thou feastest undisturbed in our proud company, and lackest naught of the banquet, but hearest our words and our speech, while no other that is a stranger and beggar hears our words? It is wine that wounds thee, honey-sweet wine, which works harm to others too, if one takes it in great gulps, and drinks beyond measure.	οὔ τι γάμου τόσσον κεχρημένος οὐδὲ χατίζων, ἀλλʼ ἄλλα φρονέων, τά οἱ οὐκ ἐτέλεσσε Κρονίων, ὄφρʼ Ἰθάκης κατὰ δῆμον ἐϋκτιμένης βασιλεύοι αὐτός, ἀτὰρ σὸν παῖδα κατακτείνειε λοχήσας. νῦν δʼ ὁ μὲν ἐν μοίρῃ πέφαται, σὺ δὲ φείδεο λαῶν
 It was wine that made foolish even the centaur, glorious Eurytion, in the hall of greathearted Peirithous, when he went to the Lapithae: and when his heart had been made foolish with wine, in his madness he wrought evil in the house of Peirithous. Then grief seized the heroes,	σῶν· ἀτὰρ ἄμμες ὄπισθεν ἀρεσσάμενοι κατὰ δῆμον, ὅσσα τοι ἐκπέποται καὶ ἐδήδοται ἐν μεγάροισι, τιμὴν ἀμφὶς ἄγοντες ἐεικοσάβοιον ἕκαστος, χαλκόν τε χρυσόν τʼ ἀποδώσομεν, εἰς ὅ κε σὸν κῆρ ἰανθῇ· πρὶν δʼ οὔ τι νεμεσσητὸν κεχολῶσθαι.
 and they leapt up and dragged him forth through the gateway, when they had shorn off his ears and his nostrils with the pitiless bronze, and he, made foolish in heart, went his way, bearing with him the curse of his sin in the folly of his heart. From hence the feud arose between the centaurs and mankind; but it was for himself first that he found evil, being heavy with wine.	τὸν δʼ ἄρʼ ὑπόδρα ἰδὼν προσέφη πολύμητις Ὀδυσσεύς· Εὐρύμαχʼ, οὐδʼ εἴ μοι πατρώϊα πάντʼ ἀποδοῖτε, ὅσσα τε νῦν ὔμμʼ ἐστὶ καὶ εἴ ποθεν ἄλλʼ ἐπιθεῖτε, οὐδέ κεν ὣς ἔτι χεῖρας ἐμὰς λήξαιμι φόνοιο πρὶν πᾶσαν μνηστῆρας ὑπερβασίην ἀποτῖσαι.
 Even so do I declare great harm for thee, if thou shalt string the bow, for thou shalt meet with no kindness at the hands of anyone in our land, but we will send thee straightway in a black ship to king Echetus, the maimer of all men, from whose hands thou shalt in no wise escape alive. Nay, then, be still,	νῦν ὑμῖν παράκειται ἐναντίον ἠὲ μάχεσθαι ἢ φεύγειν, ὅς κεν θάνατον καὶ κῆρας ἀλύξῃ· ἀλλά τινʼ οὐ φεύξεσθαι ὀΐομαι αἰπὺν ὄλεθρον. ὣς φάτο, τῶν δʼ αὐτοῦ λύτο γούνατα καὶ φίλον ἦτορ. τοῖσιν δʼ Εὐρύμαχος προσεφώνεε δεύτερον αὖτις·
and drink thy wine, and do not strive with men younger than thou.” Then wise Penelope answered him: “Antinous, it is not well nor just to rob of their due the guests of Telemachus, whosoever he be that comes to this house. Dost thou think that, if yon stranger	ὦ φίλοι, οὐ γὰρ σχήσει ἀνὴρ ὅδε χεῖρας ἀάπτους, ἀλλʼ ἐπεὶ ἔλλαβε τόξον ἐΰξοον ἠδὲ φαρέτρην, οὐδοῦ ἄπο ξεστοῦ τοξάσσεται, εἰς ὅ κε πάντας ἄμμε κατακτείνῃ· ἀλλὰ μνησώμεθα χάρμης. φάσγανά τε σπάσσασθε καὶ ἀντίσχεσθε τραπέζας
strings the great bow of Odysseus, trusting in his strength and his might, he will lead me to his home, and make me his wife? Nay, he himself, I ween, has not this hope in his breast; so let no one of you on this account sit at meat here in sorrow of heart; nay, that were indeed unseemly.”	ἰῶν ὠκυμόρων· ἐπὶ δʼ αὐτῷ πάντες ἔχωμεν ἀθρόοι, εἴ κέ μιν οὐδοῦ ἀπώσομεν ἠδὲ θυράων, ἔλθωμεν δʼ ἀνὰ ἄστυ, βοὴ δʼ ὤκιστα γένοιτο· τῷ κε τάχʼ οὗτος ἀνὴρ νῦν ὕστατα τοξάσσαιτο. ὣς ἄρα φωνήσας εἰρύσσατο φάσγανον ὀξὺ
 Then Eurymachus, son of Polybus, answered her: “Daughter of Icarius, wise Penelope, it is not that we think the man will lead thee to his home—that were indeed unseemly—but that we dread the talk of men and women, lest hereafter some base fellow among the Achaeans should say:	χάλκεον, ἀμφοτέρωθεν ἀκαχμένον, ἆλτο δʼ ἐπʼ αὐτῷ σμερδαλέα ἰάχων· ὁ δʼ ἁμαρτῆ δῖος Ὀδυσσεὺς ἰὸν ἀποπροίει, βάλε δὲ στῆθος παρὰ μαζόν, ἐν δέ οἱ ἥπατι πῆξε θοὸν βέλος· ἐκ δʼ ἄρα χειρὸς φάσγανον ἧκε χαμᾶζε, περιρρηδὴς δὲ τραπέζῃ
‘Truly men weaker far are wooing the wife of a noble man, and cannot string his polished bow. But another, a beggar, that came on his wanderings, easily strung the bow, and shot through the iron.’ Thus will men speak, but to us this would become a reproach.”	κάππεσεν ἰδνωθείς, ἀπὸ δʼ εἴδατα χεῦεν ἔραζε καὶ δέπας ἀμφικύπελλον· ὁ δὲ χθόνα τύπτε μετώπῳ θυμῷ ἀνιάζων, ποσὶ δὲ θρόνον ἀμφοτέροισι λακτίζων ἐτίνασσε· κατʼ ὀφθαλμῶν δʼ ἔχυτʼ ἀχλύς. Ἀμφίνομος δʼ Ὀδυσῆος ἐείσατο κυδαλίμοιο
Then wise Penelope answered him again: “Eurymachus, in no wise can there be good report in the land for men who dishonor and consume the house of a prince. Why then do you make this matter a reproach? This stranger is right tall and well-built,	ἀντίος ἀΐξας, εἴρυτο δὲ φάσγανον ὀξύ, εἴ πώς οἱ εἴξειε θυράων. ἀλλʼ ἄρα μιν φθῆ Τηλέμαχος κατόπισθε βαλὼν χαλκήρεϊ δουρὶ ὤμων μεσσηγύς, διὰ δὲ στήθεσφιν ἔλασσεν· δούπησεν δὲ πεσών, χθόνα δʼ ἤλασε παντὶ μετώπῳ.
 and declares himself to be born the son of a good father. Nay, come, give him the polished bow and let us see. For thus will I speak out to thee, and this word shall verily be brought to pass; if he shall string the bow, and Apollo grant him glory, I will clothe him with a cloak and tunic, fair raiment,	Τηλέμαχος δʼ ἀπόρουσε, λιπὼν δολιχόσκιον ἔγχος αὐτοῦ ἐν Ἀμφινόμῳ· περὶ γὰρ δίε μή τις Ἀχαιῶν ἔγχος ἀνελκόμενον δολιχόσκιον ἢ ἐλάσειε φασγάνῳ ἀΐξας ἠὲ προπρηνέα τύψας. βῆ δὲ θέειν, μάλα δʼ ὦκα φίλον πατέρʼ εἰσαφίκανεν,
and will give him a sharp javelin to ward off dogs and men, and a two-edged sword; and I will give him sandals to bind beneath his feet, and will send him whithersoever his heart and spirit bid him go.” Then wise Telemachus answered her: “My mother, as for the bow, no man of the Achaeans	ἀγχοῦ δʼ ἱστάμενος ἔπεα πτερόεντα προσηύδα· ὦ πάτερ, ἤδη τοι σάκος οἴσω καὶ δύο δοῦρε καὶ κυνέην πάγχαλκον, ἐπὶ κροτάφοις ἀραρυῖαν αὐτός τʼ ἀμφιβαλεῦμαι ἰών, δώσω δὲ συβώτῃ καὶ τῷ βουκόλῳ ἄλλα· τετευχῆσθαι γὰρ ἄμεινον.
has a better right than I to give or to deny it to whomsoever I will—no, not all those who lord it in rocky Ithaca , or in the islands towards horse-pasturing Elis . No man among these shall thwart me against my will, even though I should wish to give this bow outright to the stranger to bear away with him.	τὸν δʼ ἀπαμειβόμενος προσέφη πολύμητις Ὀδυσσεύς· οἶσε θέων, ἧός μοι ἀμύνεσθαι πάρʼ ὀϊστοί, μή μʼ ἀποκινήσωσι θυράων μοῦνον ἐόντα. ὣς φάτο, Τηλέμαχος δὲ φίλῳ ἐπεπείθετο πατρί, βῆ δʼ ἴμεναι θάλαμόνδʼ, ὅθι οἱ κλυτὰ τεύχεα κεῖτο.
But do thou go thy chamber, and busy thyself with thine own tasks, the loom and the distaff, and bid thy handmaids ply their tasks. The bow shall be for men, for all, but most of all for me; since mine is the authority in the house.” She then, seized with wonder, went back to her chamber,	ἔνθεν τέσσαρα μὲν σάκεʼ ἔξελε, δούρατα δʼ ὀκτὼ καὶ πίσυρας κυνέας χαλκήρεας ἱπποδασείας· βῆ δὲ φέρων, μάλα δʼ ὦκα φίλον πατέρʼ εἰσαφίκανεν, αὐτὸς δὲ πρώτιστα περὶ χροῒ δύσετο χαλκόν· ὣς δʼ αὔτως τὼ δμῶε δυέσθην τεύχεα καλά,
for she laid to heart the wise saying of her son. Up to her upper chamber she went with her handmaids, and then bewailed Odysseus, her dear husband, until flashing-eyed Athena cast sweet sleep upon her eyelids. Now the goodly swineherd had taken the curved bow and was bearing it,	ἔσταν δʼ ἀμφʼ Ὀδυσῆα δαΐφρονα ποικιλομήτην. αὐτὰρ ὅ γʼ, ὄφρα μὲν αὐτῷ ἀμύνεσθαι ἔσαν ἰοί. τόφρα μνηστήρων ἕνα γʼ αἰεὶ ᾧ ἐνὶ οἴκῳ βάλλε τιτυσκόμενος· τοὶ δʼ ἀγχιστῖνοι ἔπιπτον. αὐτὰρ ἐπεὶ λίπον ἰοὶ ὀϊστεύοντα ἄνακτα,
but the wooers all cried out in the halls. And thus would one of the proud youths speak: “Whither, pray, art thou bearing the curved bow, miserable swineherd, thou man distraught? Soon by thy swine, alone and apart from men, shall the swift hounds devour thee—hounds thyself didst rear—if but Apollo	τόξον μὲν πρὸς σταθμὸν ἐϋσταθέος μεγάροιο ἔκλινʼ ἑστάμεναι, πρὸς ἐνώπια παμφανόωντα, αὐτὸς δʼ ἀμφʼ ὤμοισι σάκος θέτο τετραθέλυμνον, κρατὶ δʼ ἐπʼ ἰφθίμῳ κυνέην εὔτυκτον ἔθηκεν, ἵππουριν, δεινὸν δὲ λόφος καθύπερθεν ἔνευεν·
be gracious to us, and the other immortal gods.” So they spoke, and he set down the bow, as he bore it, in that very place, seized with fear because many men were crying out aloud in the halls. But Telemachus on the other side called out threateningly: “Father, bear the bow onward—soon shalt thou rue giving heed to all—	εἵλετο δʼ ἄλκιμα δοῦρε δύω κεκορυθμένα χαλκῷ. ὀρσοθύρη δέ τις ἔσκεν ἐϋδμήτῳ ἐνὶ τοίχῳ, ἀκρότατον δὲ παρʼ οὐδὸν ἐϋσταθέος μεγάροιο ἦν ὁδὸς ἐς λαύρην, σανίδες δʼ ἔχον εὖ ἀραρυῖαι. τὴν δʼ Ὀδυσεὺς φράζεσθαι ἀνώγει δῖον ὑφορβὸν
 lest, younger though I am, I drive thee to the field, and pelt thee with stones; for in strength I am the better. I would that I were even so much better in strength and might than all the wooers that are in the house; then would I soon send many a one	ἑσταότʼ ἄγχʼ αὐτῆς· μία δʼ οἴη γίγνετʼ ἐφορμή. τοῖς δʼ Ἀγέλεως μετέειπεν, ἔπος πάντεσσι πιφαύσκων· ὦ φίλοι, οὐκ ἂν δή τις ἀνʼ ὀρσοθύρην ἀναβαίη καὶ εἴποι λαοῖσι, βοὴ δʼ ὤκιστα γένοιτο; τῷ κε τάχʼ οὗτος ἀνὴρ νῦν ὕστατα τοξάσσαιτο.
forth from our house to go his way in evil case; for they devise wickedness.” So he spoke, but all the wooers laughed merrily at him, and relaxed the bitterness of their anger against Telemachus. Howbeit the swineherd bore the bow through the hall, and came up to wise Odysseus, and put it in his hands.	τὸν δʼ αὖτε προσέειπε Μελάνθιος, αἰπόλος αἰγῶν· οὔ πως ἔστʼ, Ἀγέλαε διοτρεφές· ἄγχι γὰρ αἰνῶς αὐλῆς καλὰ θύρετρα καὶ ἀργαλέον στόμα λαύρης· καί χʼ εἷς πάντας ἐρύκοι ἀνήρ, ὅς τʼ ἄλκιμος εἴη. ἀλλʼ ἄγεθʼ, ὑμῖν τεύχεʼ ἐνείκω θωρηχθῆναι
Then he called forth the nurse Eurycleia, and said to her: “Telemachus bids thee, wise Eurycleia, to bar the close-fitting doors of the hall, and if any of the women hear within groanings or the din of men within our walls, let them not	ἐκ θαλάμου· ἔνδον γάρ, ὀΐομαι, οὐδέ πη ἄλλῃ τεύχεα κατθέσθην Ὀδυσεὺς καὶ φαίδιμος υἱός. ὣς εἰπὼν ἀνέβαινε Μελάνθιος, αἰπόλος αἰγῶν, εἰς θαλάμους Ὀδυσῆος ἀνὰ ῥῶγας μεγάροιο. ἔνθεν δώδεκα μὲν σάκεʼ ἔξελε, τόσσα δὲ δοῦρα
rush out, but remain where they are in silence at their work.” So he spoke, but her word remained unwinged; and she barred the doors of the stately halls. But in silence Philoetius hastened forth from the house, and barred the gates of the well-fenced court.	καὶ τόσσας κυνέας χαλκήρεας ἱπποδασείας· βῆ δʼ ἴμεναι, μάλα δʼ ὦκα φέρων μνηστῆρσιν ἔδωκεν. καὶ τότʼ Ὀδυσσῆος λύτο γούνατα καὶ φίλον ἦτορ, ὡς περιβαλλομένους ἴδε τεύχεα χερσί τε δοῦρα μακρὰ τινάσσοντας· μέγα δʼ αὐτῷ φαίνετο ἔργον.
Now there lay beneath the portico the cable of a curved ship, made of byblus plant, wherewith he made fast the gates, and then himself went within. Thereafter he came and sat down on the seat from which he had risen, and gazed upon Odysseus; now he was already handling the bow, turning it round and round, and trying it this way and that, lest worms might have eaten the horns, while its lord was afar. And thus would one speak with a glance at his neighbor: “Verily he has a shrewd eye, and is a cunning knave with a bow. It may be haply that he has himself such bows stored away at home, or else he is minded to make one, that he thus turns it this way and that in his hands, the rascally vagabond.” And again another of the proud youths would say: “Would that the fellow might find profit in just such measure as he shall prove able ever to string this bow.” So spoke the wooers, but Odysseus of many wiles, as soon as he had lifted the great bow and scanned it on every side—even as when a man well-skilled in the lyre and in song easily stretches the string about a new peg, making fast at either end the twisted sheep-gut—so without effort did Odysseus string the great bow. And he held it in his right hand, and tried the string, which sang sweetly beneath his touch, like to a swallow in tone. But upon the wooers came great grief, and the faces of them changed color, and Zeus thundered loud, shewing forth his signs. Then glad at heart was the much-enduring, goodly Odysseus that the son of crooked-counselling Cronos sent him an omen, and he took up a swift arrow, which lay by him on the table, bare, but the others were stored within the hollow quiver, even those of which the Achaeans were soon to taste. This he took, and laid upon the bridge of the bow, and drew the bow-string and the notched arrow even from the chair where he sat, and let fly the shaft with sure aim, and did not miss the end of the handle of one of the axes, but clean through and out at the end passed the arrow weighted with bronze. But he spoke to Telemachus, saying: “Telemachus, the stranger that sits in thy halls brings no shame upon thee, nor in any wise did I miss the mark, or labour long in stringing the bow; still is my strength unbroken—not as the wooers scornfully taunt me. But now it is time that supper too be made ready for the Achaeans, while yet there is light, and thereafter must yet other sport be made with song and with the lyre; for these things are the accompaniments of a feast.” He spoke, and made a sign with his brows, and Telemachus, the dear son of divine Odysseus, girt about him his sharp sword, and took his spear in his grasp, and stood by the chair at his father's side, armed with gleaming bronze.	αἶψα δὲ Τηλέμαχον ἔπεα πτερόεντα προσηύδα· Τηλέμαχʼ, ἦ μάλα δή τις ἐνὶ μεγάροισι γυναικῶν νῶϊν ἐποτρύνει πόλεμον κακὸν ἠὲ Μελανθεύς. τὸν δʼ αὖ Τηλέμαχος πεπνυμένος ἀντίον ηὔδα· ὦ πάτερ, αὐτὸς ἐγὼ τόδε γʼ ἤμβροτον—οὐδέ τις ἄλλος
But Odysseus of many wiles stripped off his rags and sprang to the great threshold with the bow and the quiver full of arrows, and poured forth the swift arrows right there before his feet, and spoke among the wooers:	ὣς οἱ μὲν τοιαῦτα πρὸς ἀλλήλους ἀγόρευον, βῆ δʼ αὖτις θάλαμόνδε Μελάνθιος, αἰπόλος αἰγῶν, οἴσων τεύχεα καλά. νόησε δὲ δῖος ὑφορβός, αἶψα δʼ Ὀδυσσῆα προσεφώνεεν ἐγγὺς ἐόντα· διογενὲς Λαερτιάδη, πολυμήχανʼ Ὀδυσσεῦ,
“Lo, now at last is this decisive contest ended; and now as for another mark, which till now no man has ever smitten, I will know if haply I may strike it, and Apollo grant me glory.” He spoke, and aimed a bitter arrow at Antinous. Now he was on the point of raising to his lips a fair goblet,	κεῖνος δʼ αὖτʼ ἀΐδηλος ἀνήρ, ὃν ὀϊόμεθʼ αὐτοί, ἔρχεται ἐς θάλαμον· σὺ δέ μοι νημερτὲς ἐνίσπες, ἤ μιν ἀποκτείνω, αἴ κε κρείσσων γε γένωμαι, ἦε σοὶ ἐνθάδʼ ἄγω, ἵνʼ ὑπερβασίας ἀποτίσῃ πολλάς, ὅσσας οὗτος ἐμήσατο σῷ ἐνὶ οἴκῳ.
 But Odysseus took aim, and smote him with an arrow in the throat, and clean out through the tender neck passed the point; he sank to one side, and the cup fell from his hand as he was smitten, and straightway up through his nostrils there came a thick jet of the blood of man; and quickly	τὸν δʼ ἀπαμειβόμενος προσέφη πολύμητις Ὀδυσσεύς· ἦ τοι ἐγὼ καὶ Τηλέμαχος μνηστῆρας ἀγαυοὺς σχήσομεν ἔντοσθεν μεγάρων, μάλα περ μεμαῶτας. σφῶϊ δʼ ἀποστρέψαντε πόδας καὶ χεῖρας ὕπερθεν ἐς θάλαμον βαλέειν, σανίδας δʼ ἐκδῆσαι ὄπισθε,
 he thrust the table from him with a kick of his foot, and spilled all the food on the floor, and the bread and roast flesh were befouled. Then into uproar broke the wooers through the halls, as they saw the man fallen, and from their high seats they sprang, driven in fear through the hall, gazing everywhere along the well-built walls;	σειρὴν δὲ πλεκτὴν ἐξ αὐτοῦ πειρήναντε κίονʼ ἀνʼ ὑψηλὴν ἐρύσαι πελάσαι τε δοκοῖσιν, ὥς κεν δηθὰ ζωὸς ἐὼν χαλέπʼ ἄλγεα πάσχῃ· ὣς ἔφαθʼ, οἱ δʼ ἄρα τοῦ μάλα μὲν κλύον ἠδʼ ἐπίθοντο, βὰν δʼ ἴμεν ἐς θάλαμον, λαθέτην δέ μιν ἔνδον ἐόντα.
but nowhere was there a shield or mighty spear to seize. But they railed at Odysseus with angry words: “Stranger, to thy cost dost thou shoot at men; never again shalt thou take part in other contests; now is thy utter destruction sure. Aye, for thou hast now slain a man who was far the best	ἦ τοι ὁ μὲν θαλάμοιο μυχὸν κάτα τεύχεʼ ἐρεύνα, τὼ δʼ ἔσταν ἑκάτερθε παρὰ σταθμοῖσι μένοντε. εὖθʼ ὑπὲρ οὐδὸν ἔβαινε Μελάνθιος, αἰπόλος αἰγῶν, τῇ ἑτέρῃ μὲν χειρὶ φέρων καλὴν τρυφάλειαν, τῇ δʼ ἑτέρῃ σάκος εὐρὺ γέρον, πεπαλαγμένον ἄζῃ,
of the youths in Ithaca ; therefore shall vultures devour thee here.” So spoke each man, for verily they thought that he had not slain the man willfully; and in their folly they knew not this, that over themselves one and all the cords of destruction had been made fast. Then with an angry glance from beneath his brows Odysseus of many wiles answered them:	Λαέρτεω ἥρωος, ὃ κουρίζων φορέεσκε· δὴ τότε γʼ ἤδη κεῖτο, ῥαφαὶ δὲ λέλυντο ἱμάντων· τὼ δʼ ἄρʼ ἐπαΐξανθʼ ἑλέτην ἔρυσάν τέ μιν εἴσω κουρίξ, ἐν δαπέδῳ δὲ χαμαὶ βάλον ἀχνύμενον κῆρ, σὺν δὲ πόδας χεῖράς τε δέον θυμαλγέϊ δεσμῷ
 “Ye dogs, ye thought that I should never more come home from the land of the Trojans, seeing that ye wasted my house, and lay with the maidservants by force, and while yet I lived covertly wooed my wife, having no fear of the gods, who hold broad heaven,	εὖ μάλʼ ἀποστρέψαντε διαμπερές, ὡς ἐκέλευσεν υἱὸς Λαέρταο, πολύτλας δῖος Ὀδυσσεύς· σειρὴν δὲ πλεκτὴν ἐξ αὐτοῦ πειρήναντε κίονʼ ἀνʼ ὑψηλὴν ἔρυσαν πέλασάν τε δοκοῖσι. τὸν δʼ ἐπικερτομέων προσέφης, Εὔμαιε συβῶτα·
nor of the indignation of men, that is to be hereafter. Now over you one and all have the cords of destruction been made fast.” So he spoke, and thereat pale fear seized them all, and each man gazed about to see how he might escape utter destruction; Eurymachus alone answered him, and said:	νῦν μὲν δὴ μάλα πάγχυ, Μελάνθιε, νύκτα φυλάξεις, εὐνῇ ἔνι μαλακῇ καταλέγμενος, ὥς σε ἔοικεν· οὐδέ σέ γʼ ἠριγένεια παρʼ Ὠκεανοῖο ῥοάων λήσει ἐπερχομένη χρυσόθρονος, ἡνίκʼ ἀγινεῖς αἶγας μνηστήρεσσι δόμον κάτα δαῖτα πένεσθαι.
“If thou art indeed Odysseus of Ithaca , come home again, this that thou sayest is just regarding all that the Achaeans have wrought—many deeds of wanton folly in thy halls and many in the field. But he now lies dead, who was to blame for all, even Antinous; for it was he who set on foot these deeds,	ὣς ὁ μὲν αὖθι λέλειπτο, ταθεὶς ὀλοῷ ἐνὶ δεσμῷ· τὼ δʼ ἐς τεύχεα δύντε, θύρην ἐπιθέντε φαεινήν, βήτην εἰς Ὀδυσῆα δαΐφρονα, ποικιλομήτην. ἔνθα μένος πνείοντες ἐφέστασαν, οἱ μὲν ἐπʼ οὐδοῦ τέσσαρες, οἱ δʼ ἔντοσθε δόμων πολέες τε καὶ ἐσθλοί.
not so much through desire or need of the marriage, but with another purpose, which the son of Cronos did not bring to pass for him, that in the land of settled Ithaca he might himself be king, and might lie in wait for thy son and slay him. But now he lies slain, as was his due, but do thou spare the people	τοῖσι δʼ ἐπʼ ἀγχίμολον θυγάτηρ Διὸς ἦλθεν Ἀθήνη, Μέντορι εἰδομένη ἠμὲν δέμας ἠδὲ καὶ αὐδήν. τὴν δʼ Ὀδυσεὺς γήθησεν ἰδὼν καὶ μῦθον ἔειπε· Μέντορ, ἄμυνον ἀρήν, μνῆσαι δʼ ἑτάροιο φίλοιο, ὅς σʼ ἀγαθὰ ῥέζεσκον· ὁμηλικίην δέ μοί ἐσσι.
 Then with an angry glance from beneath his brows Odysseus of many wiles answered him: “Eurymachus, not even if you should give me in requital all that your fathers left you, even all that you now have, and should add other wealth thereto from whence ye might, not even so would I henceforth stay my hands from slaying until the wooers had paid the full price of all their transgression.	ὣς φάτʼ, ὀϊόμενος λαοσσόον ἔμμεν Ἀθήνην. μνηστῆρες δʼ ἑτέρωθεν ὁμόκλεον ἐν μεγάροισι· πρῶτος τήν γʼ ἐνένιπε Δαμαστορίδης Ἀγέλαος· Μέντορ, μή σʼ ἐπέεσσι παραιπεπίθῃσιν Ὀδυσσεὺς μνηστήρεσσι μάχεσθαι, ἀμυνέμεναι δέ οἱ αὐτῷ.
Now it lies before you to fight in open fight, or to flee, if any man may avoid death and the fates; but many a one, methinks, shall not escape from utter destruction.” So he spoke, and their knees were loosened where they stood, and their hearts melted; and Eurymachus spoke among them again a second time:	ὧδε γὰρ ἡμέτερόν γε νόον τελέεσθαι ὀΐω· ὁππότε κεν τούτους κτέωμεν, πατέρʼ ἠδὲ καὶ υἱόν, ἐν δὲ σὺ τοῖσιν ἔπειτα πεφήσεαι, οἷα μενοινᾷς ἔρδειν ἐν μεγάροις· σῷ δʼ αὐτοῦ κράατι τίσεις. αὐτὰρ ἐπὴν ὑμέων γε βίας ἀφελώμεθα χαλκῷ,
 “Friends, for you see that this man will not stay his invincible hands, but now that he was got the polished bow and the quiver, will shoot from the smooth threshold until he slays us all, come, let us take thought of battle. Draw your swords, and hold the tables before you against	κτήμαθʼ ὁπόσσα τοί ἐστι, τά τʼ ἔνδοθι καὶ τὰ θύρηφι, τοῖσιν Ὀδυσσῆος μεταμίξομεν· οὐδέ τοι υἷας ζώειν ἐν μεγάροισιν ἐάσομεν, οὐδέ θύγατρας οὐδʼ ἄλοχον κεδνὴν Ἰθάκης κατὰ ἄστυ πολεύειν. ὣς φάτʼ, Ἀθηναίη δὲ χολώσατο κηρόθι μᾶλλον,
the arrows that bring swift death, and let us all have at him in a body, in the hope that we may thrust him from the threshold and the doorway, and go throughout the city, and so the alarm be swiftly raised; then should this fellow soon have shot his last.” So saying, he drew his sharp sword	νείκεσσεν δʼ Ὀδυσῆα χολωτοῖσιν ἐπέεσσιν· οὐκέτι σοί γʼ, Ὀδυσεῦ, μένος ἔμπεδον οὐδέ τις ἀλκή οἵη ὅτʼ ἀμφʼ Ἑλένῃ λευκωλένῳ εὐπατερείῃ, εἰνάετες Τρώεσσιν ἐμάρναο νωλεμὲς αἰεί, πολλοὺς δʼ ἄνδρας ἔπεφνες ἐν αἰνῇ δηϊοτῆτι,
 of bronze, two-edged, and sprang upon Odysseus with a terrible cry, but at the same instant goodly Odysseus let fly an arrow, and struck him upon the breast beside the nipple, and fixed the swift shaft in his liver. And Eurymachus let the sword fall from his hand to the ground, and writhing over the table	σῇ δʼ ἥλω βουλῇ Πριάμου πόλις εὐρυάγυια. πῶς δὴ νῦν, ὅτε σόν τε δόμον καὶ κτήμαθʼ ἱκάνεις, ἄντα μνηστήρων ὀλοφύρεαι ἄλκιμος εἶναι; ἀλλʼ ἄγε δεῦρο, πέπον, παρʼ ἔμʼ ἵστασο καὶ ἴδε ἔργον, ὄφρʼ εἰδῇς οἷός τοι ἐν ἀνδράσι δυσμενέεσσιν
he bowed and fell, and spilt upon the floor the food and the two-handled cup. With his brow he beat the earth in agony of soul, and with both his feet he spurned and shook the chair, and a mist was shed over his eyes. Then Amphinomus made at glorious Odysseus,	Μέντωρ Ἀλκιμίδης εὐεργεσίας ἀποτίνειν. ἦ ῥα, καὶ οὔ πω πάγχυ δίδου ἑτεραλκέα νίκην, ἀλλʼ ἔτʼ ἄρα σθένεός τε καὶ ἀλκῆς πειρήτιζεν ἠμὲν Ὀδυσσῆος ἠδʼ υἱοῦ κυδαλίμοιο. αὐτὴ δʼ αἰθαλόεντος ἀνὰ μεγάροιο μέλαθρον
 rushing straight upon him, and had drawn his sharp sword, in hope that Odysseus might give way before him from the door. But Telemachus was too quick for him, and cast, and smote him from behind with his bronze-tipped spear between the shoulders, and drove it through his breast; and he fell with a thud, and struck the ground full with his forehead.	ἕζετʼ ἀναΐξασα, χελιδόνι εἰκέλη ἄντην. μνηστῆρας δʼ ὤτρυνε Δαμαστορίδης Ἀγέλαος, Εὐρύνομός τε καὶ Ἀμφιμέδων Δημοπτόλεμός τε, Πείσανδρός τε Πολυκτορίδης Πόλυβός τε δαΐφρων· οἱ γὰρ μνηστήρων ἀρετῇ ἔσαν ἔξοχʼ ἄριστοι,
 But Telemachus sprang back, leaving the long spear where it was, fixed in Amphinomus, for he greatly feared lest, as he sought to draw forth the long spear, one of the Achaeans might rush upon him and stab with his sword, or deal him a blow as he stooped over the corpse. So he started to run, and came quickly to his dear father,	ὅσσοι ἔτʼ ἔζωον περί τε ψυχέων ἐμάχοντο· τοὺς δʼ ἤδη ἐδάμασσε βιὸς καὶ ταρφέες ἰοί. τοῖς δʼ Ἀγέλεως μετέειπεν, ἔπος πάντεσσι πιφαύσκων· ὦ φίλοι, ἤδη σχήσει ἀνὴρ ὅδε χεῖρας ἀάπτους· καὶ δή οἱ Μέντωρ μὲν ἔβη κενὰ εὔγματα εἰπών,
and standing by his side spoke to him winged words: “Father, now will I bring thee a shield and two spears and a helmet all of bronze, well fitted to the temples, and when I come back I will arm myself, and will give armour likewise to the swineherd and yon neatherd; for it is better to be clothed in armour.”	οἱ δʼ οἶοι λείπονται ἐπὶ πρώτῃσι θύρῃσι. τῷ νῦν μὴ ἅμα πάντες ἐφίετε δούρατα μακρά, ἀλλʼ ἄγεθʼ οἱ ἓξ πρῶτον ἀκοντίσατʼ, αἴ κέ ποθι Ζεὺς δώῃ Ὀδυσσῆα βλῆσθαι καὶ κῦδος ἀρέσθαι. τῶν δʼ ἄλλων οὐ κῆδος, ἐπὴν οὗτός γε πέσῃσιν.
 Thence he took four shields and eight spears and four helmets of bronze, with thick plumes of horse-hair; and he bore them forth, and quickly came to his dear father. Then first of all he himself girded the bronze about his body, and even in like manner the two slaves put on them the beautiful armour,	ὣς ἔφαθʼ, οἱ δʼ ἄρα πάντες ἀκόντισαν ὡς ἐκέλευεν, ἱέμενοι· τὰ δὲ πάντα ἐτώσια θῆκεν Ἀθήνη, τῶν ἄλλος μὲν σταθμὸν ἐϋσταθέος μεγάροιο βεβλήκει, ἄλλος δὲ θύρην πυκινῶς ἀραρυῖαν· ἄλλου δʼ ἐν τοίχῳ μελίη πέσε χαλκοβάρεια.
and took their stand on either side of Odysseus, the wise and crafty-minded. But he, so long as he had arrows to defend him, would ever aim, and smite the wooers one by one in his house, and they fell thick and fast. But when the arrows failed the prince, as he shot,	αὐτὰρ ἐπεὶ δὴ δούρατʼ ἀλεύαντο μνηστήρων, τοῖς δʼ ἄρα μύθων ἦρχε πολύτλας δῖος Ὀδυσσεύς· ὦ φίλοι, ἤδη μέν κεν ἐγὼν εἴποιμι καὶ ἄμμι μνηστήρων ἐς ὅμιλον ἀκοντίσαι, οἳ μεμάασιν ἡμέας ἐξεναρίξαι ἐπὶ προτέροισι κακοῖσιν.
 he leaned the bow against the door-post of the well-built hall, and let it stand against the bright entrance wall. For himself, he put about his shoulders a four-fold shield, and set on his mighty head a well-wrought helmet with horse-hair plume, and terribly did the plume wave above him;	ὣς ἔφαθʼ, οἱ δʼ ἄρα πάντες ἀκόντισαν ὀξέα δοῦρα ἄντα τιτυσκόμενοι· Δημοπτόλεμον μὲν Ὀδυσσεύς, Εὐρυάδην δʼ ἄρα Τηλέμαχος, Ἔλατον δὲ συβώτης, Πείσανδρον δʼ ἄρʼ ἔπεφνε βοῶν ἐπιβουκόλος ἀνήρ. οἱ μὲν ἔπειθʼ ἅμα πάντες ὀδὰξ ἕλον ἄσπετον οὖδας,
and he took two mighty spears, tipped with bronze. Now there was in the well-built wall a certain postern door, and along the topmost level of the threshold of the well-built hall was a way into a passage, and well-fitting folding doors closed it. This postern Odysseus bade the goodly swineherd watch,	μνηστῆρες δʼ ἀνεχώρησαν μεγάροιο μυχόνδε· τοὶ δʼ ἄρʼ ἐπήϊξαν, νεκύων δʼ ἐξ ἔγχεʼ ἕλοντο. αὖτις δὲ μνηστῆρες ἀκόντισαν ὀξέα δοῦρα ἱέμενοι· τὰ δὲ πολλὰ ἐτώσια θῆκεν Ἀθήνη. τῶν ἄλλος μὲν σταθμὸν ἐϋσταθέος μεγάροιο
taking his stand close by, for there was but a single way to reach it. Then Agelaus spoke among the wooers, and declared his word to all: “Friends, will not one mount up by the postern door, and tell the people, that so an alarm may be raised straightway? Then should this fellow soon have shot his last.”	βεβλήκειν, ἄλλος δὲ θύρην πυκινῶς ἀραρυῖαν· ἄλλου δʼ ἐν τοίχῳ μελίη πέσε χαλκοβάρεια. Ἀμφιμέδων δʼ ἄρα Τηλέμαχον βάλε χεῖρʼ ἐπὶ καρπῷ λίγδην, ἄκρον δὲ ῥινὸν δηλήσατο χαλκός. Κτήσιππος δʼ Εὔμαιον ὑπὲρ σάκος ἔγχεϊ μακρῷ
 Then Melanthius, the goatherd, answered him: “It may not be, Agelaus, fostered of Zeus, for terribly near is the fair door of the court, and the mouth of the passage is hard. One man could bar the way for all, so he were valiant. But come, let me bring you	ὦμον ἐπέγραψεν· τὸ δʼ ὑπέρπτατο, πῖπτε δʼ ἔραζε. τοὶ δʼ αὖτʼ ἀμφʼ Ὀδυσῆα δαΐφρονα ποικιλομήτην, μνηστήρων ἐς ὅμιλον ἀκόντισαν ὀξέα δοῦρα. ἔνθʼ αὖτʼ Εὐρυδάμαντα βάλε πτολίπορθος Ὀδυσσεύς, Ἀμφιμέδοντα δὲ Τηλέμαχος, Πόλυβον δὲ συβώτης·
from the store-room arms to don, for it is within, methinks, and nowhere else that Odysseus and his glorious son have laid the arms.” So saying, Melanthius, the goatherd, mounted up by the steps of the hall to the store-rooms of Odysseus. Thence he took twelve shields, as many spears,	Κτήσιππον δʼ ἄρʼ ἔπειτα βοῶν ἐπιβουκόλος ἀνὴρ βεβλήκει πρὸς στῆθος, ἐπευχόμενος δὲ προσηύδα· ὦ Πολυθερσεΐδη φιλοκέρτομε, μή ποτε πάμπαν εἴκων ἀφραδίῃς μέγα εἰπεῖν, ἀλλὰ θεοῖσιν μῦθον ἐπιτρέψαι, ἐπεὶ ἦ πολὺ φέρτεροί εἰσι.
 and as many helmets of bronze with thick plumes of horsehair, and went his way, and quickly brought and gave them to the wooers. Then the knees of Odysseus were loosened and his heart melted, when he saw them donning armour and brandishing long spears in their hands, and great did his task seem to him;	τοῦτό τοι ἀντὶ ποδὸς ξεινήϊον, ὅν ποτʼ ἔδωκας ἀντιθέῳ Ὀδυσῆϊ δόμον κάτʼ ἀλητεύοντι. ἦ ῥα βοῶν ἑλίκων ἐπιβουκόλος· αὐτὰρ Ὀδυσσεὺς οὖτα Δαμαστορίδην αὐτοσχεδὸν ἔγχεϊ μακρῷ. Τηλέμαχος δʼ Εὐηνορίδην Λειώκριτον οὖτα
but quickly he spoke to Telemachus winged words: “Telemachus, verily some one of the women in the halls is rousing against us an evil battle, or haply it is Melanthius.” Then wise Telemachus answered him: “Father, it is I myself that am at fault in this, and no other	δουρὶ μέσον κενεῶνα, διαπρὸ δὲ χαλκὸν ἔλασσεν· ἤριπε δὲ πρηνής, χθόνα δʼ ἤλασε παντὶ μετώπῳ. δὴ τότʼ Ἀθηναίη φθισίμβροτον αἰγίδʼ ἀνέσχεν ὑψόθεν ἐξ ὀροφῆς· τῶν δὲ φρένες ἐπτοίηθεν. οἱ δʼ ἐφέβοντο κατὰ μέγαρον βόες ὣς ἀγελαῖαι·
is to blame, for I left the close-fitting door of the store-room open: their watcher was better than I. But go now, goodly Eumaeus, close the door of the store-room, and see whether it is one of the women who does this, or Melanthius, son of Dolius, as I suspect.”	τὰς μέν τʼ αἰόλος οἶστρος ἐφορμηθεὶς ἐδόνησεν ὥρῃ ἐν εἰαρινῇ, ὅτε τʼ ἤματα μακρὰ πέλονται. οἱ δʼ ὥς τʼ αἰγυπιοὶ γαμψώνυχες ἀγκυλοχεῖλαι, ἐξ ὀρέων ἐλθόντες ἐπʼ ὀρνίθεσσι θόρωσι· ταὶ μέν τʼ ἐν πεδίῳ νέφεα πτώσσουσαι ἵενται,
Thus they spoke to one another. But Melanthius, the goatherd, went again to the store-room to bring beautiful armour; howbeit the goodly swineherd marked him, and straightway said to Odysseus who was near: “Son of Laertes, sprung from Zeus, Odysseus of many devices,	οἱ δέ τε τὰς ὀλέκουσιν ἐπάλμενοι, οὐδέ τις ἀλκὴ γίγνεται οὐδὲ φυγή· χαίρουσι δέ τʼ ἀνέρες ἄγρῃ· ὣς ἄρα τοὶ μνηστῆρας ἐπεσσύμενοι κατὰ δῶμα τύπτον ἐπιστροφάδην· τῶν δὲ στόνος ὤρνυτʼ ἀεικὴς κράτων τυπτομένων, δάπεδον δʼ ἅπαν αἵματι θῦε.
yonder again is the pestilent fellow, whom we ourselves suspect, going to the store-room. But do thou tell me truly, shall I slay him, if I prove the better man, or shall I bring him hither to thee, that the fellow may pay for the many crimes that he has planned in thy house?”	Λειώδης δʼ Ὀδυσῆος ἐπεσσύμενος λάβε γούνων, καί μιν λισσόμενος ἔπεα πτερόεντα προσηύδα· γουνοῦμαί σʼ, Ὀδυσεῦ· σὺ δέ μʼ αἴδεο καί μʼ ἐλέησον· οὐ γάρ πώ τινά φημι γυναικῶν ἐν μεγάροισιν εἰπεῖν οὐδέ τι ῥέξαι ἀτάσθαλον· ἀλλὰ καὶ ἄλλους
 Then Odysseus of many wiles answered him and said: “Verily I and Telemachus will keep the lordly wooers within the hall, how fierce soever they be, but do you two bend behind him his feet and his arms above, and cast him into the store-room, and tie boards behind his back;	παύεσκον μνηστῆρας, ὅτις τοιαῦτά γε ῥέζοι. ἀλλά μοι οὐ πείθοντο κακῶν ἄπο χεῖρας ἔχεσθαι· τῷ καὶ ἀτασθαλίῃσιν ἀεικέα πότμον ἐπέσπον. αὐτὰρ ἐγὼ μετὰ τοῖσι θυοσκόος οὐδὲν ἐοργὼς κείσομαι, ὡς οὐκ ἔστι χάρις μετόπισθʼ εὐεργέων·
then make fast to his body a twisted rope, and hoist him up the tall pillar, till you bring him near the roof-beams, that he may keep alive long, and suffer grievous torment.” So he spoke, and they readily hearkened and obeyed. Forth they went to the store-room, unseen of him who was within.	τὸν δʼ ἄρʼ ὑπόδρα ἰδὼν προσέφη πολύμητις Ὀδυσσεύς· εἰ μὲν δὴ μετὰ τοῖσι θυοσκόος εὔχεαι εἶναι, πολλάκι που μέλλεις ἀρήμεναι ἐν μεγάροισι τηλοῦ ἐμοὶ νόστοιο τέλος γλυκεροῖο γενέσθαι, σοὶ δʼ ἄλοχόν τε φίλην σπέσθαι καὶ τέκνα τεκέσθαι·
 He truly was seeking for armour in the innermost part of the store-room, and the two lay in wait, standing on either side of the door-posts. And when Melanthius, the goatherd, was about to pass over the threshold, bearing in one hand a goodly helm, and in the other a broad old shield, flecked with rust—	τῷ οὐκ ἂν θάνατόν γε δυσηλεγέα προφύγοισθα. ὣς ἄρα φωνήσας ξίφος εἵλετο χειρὶ παχείῃ κείμενον, ὅ ῥʼ Ἀγέλαος ἀποπροέηκε χαμᾶζε κτεινόμενος· τῷ τόν γε κατʼ αὐχένα μέσσον ἔλασσε. φθεγγομένου δʼ ἄρα τοῦ γε κάρη κονίῃσιν ἐμίχθη.
binding them firmly behind his back, as the son of Laertes bade them, the much enduring, goodly Odysseus; and they made fast to his body a twisted rope, and hoisted him up the tall pillar, till they brought him near the roof-beams. Then didst thou mock him, swineherd Eumaeus, and say:	Τερπιάδης δʼ ἔτʼ ἀοιδὸς ἀλύσκανε κῆρα μέλαιναν, Φήμιος, ὅς ῥʼ ἤειδε μετὰ μνηστῆρσιν ἀνάγκῃ. ἔστη δʼ ἐν χείρεσσίν ἔχων φόρμιγγα λίγειαν ἄγχι παρʼ ὀρσοθύρην· δίχα δὲ φρεσὶ μερμήριζεν, ἢ ἐκδὺς μεγάροιο Διὸς μεγάλου ποτὶ βωμὸν
“Now verily, Melanthius, shalt thou watch the whole night through, lying on a soft bed, as befits thee, nor shalt thou fail to mark the early Dawn, golden-throned, as she comes forth from the streams of Oceanus, at the hour when thou art wont to drive thy she-goats for the wooers, to prepare a feast in the halls.”	ἑρκείου ἵζοιτο τετυγμένον, ἔνθʼ ἄρα πολλὰ Λαέρτης Ὀδυσεύς τε βοῶν ἐπὶ μηρίʼ ἔκηαν, ἦ γούνων λίσσοιτο προσαΐξας Ὀδυσῆα. ὧδε δέ οἱ φρονέοντι δοάσσατο κέρδιον εἶναι, γούνων ἅψασθαι Λαερτιάδεω Ὀδυσῆος.
 So he was left there, stretched in the direful bond, but the two put on their armour, and closed the bright door, and went to Odysseus, the wise and crafty-minded. There they stood, breathing fury, those on the threshold but four, while those within the hall were many and brave.	ἦ τοι ὁ φόρμιγγα γλαφυρὴν κατέθηκε χαμᾶζε μεσσηγὺς κρητῆρος ἰδὲ θρόνου ἀργυροήλου, αὐτὸς δʼ αὖτʼ Ὀδυσῆα προσαΐξας λάβε γούνων, καί μιν λισσόμενος ἔπεα πτερόεντα προσηύδα· γουνοῦμαί σʼ, Ὀδυσεῦ· σὺ δέ μʼ αἴδεο καί μʼ ἐλέησον·
Then Athena, daughter of Zeus, drew near them, like unto Mentor in form and voice, and Odysseus saw her, and was glad; and he spoke, saying: “Mentor, ward off ruin, and remember me, thy dear comrade, who often befriended thee. Thou art of like age with myself.”	αὐτῷ τοι μετόπισθʼ ἄχος ἔσσεται, εἴ κεν ἀοιδὸν πέφνῃς, ὅς τε θεοῖσι καὶ ἀνθρώποισιν ἀείδω. αὐτοδίδακτος δʼ εἰμί, θεὸς δέ μοι ἐν φρεσὶν οἴμας παντοίας ἐνέφυσεν· ἔοικα δέ τοι παραείδειν ὥς τε θεῷ· τῷ μή με λιλαίεο δειροτομῆσαι.
So he spoke, deeming that it was Athena, the rouser of hosts. But the wooers on the other side shouted aloud in the hall, and first Agelaus, son of Damastor, rebuked Athena, saying: “Mentor, let not Odysseus beguile thee with his words to fight against the wooers and bear aid to himself.	καί κεν Τηλέμαχος τάδε γʼ εἴποι, σὸς φίλος υἱός, ὡς ἐγὼ οὔ τι ἑκὼν ἐς σὸν δόμον οὐδὲ χατίζων πωλεύμην μνηστῆρσιν ἀεισόμενος μετὰ δαῖτας, ἀλλὰ πολὺ πλέονες καὶ κρείσσονες ἦγον ἀνάγκῃ. ὣς φάτο, τοῦ δʼ ἤκουσʼ ἱερὴ ἲς Τηλεμάχοιο,
 For in this wise, methinks, shall our will be brought to pass: when we have killed these men, father and son, thereafter shalt thou too be slain with them, such deeds art thou minded to do in these halls: with thine own head shalt thou pay the price. But when with the sword we have stripped you of your might,	αἶψα δʼ ἑὸν πατέρα προσεφώνεεν ἐγγὺς ἐόντα· ἴσχεο μηδέ τι τοῦτον ἀναίτιον οὔταε χαλκῷ· καὶ κήρυκα Μέδοντα σαώσομεν, ὅς τέ μευ αἰεὶ οἴκῳ ἐν ἡμετέρῳ κηδέσκετο παιδὸς ἐόντος, εἰ δὴ μή μιν ἔπεφνε Φιλοίτιος ἠὲ συβώτης,
all the possessions that thou hast within doors and in the fields we will mingle with those of Odysseus, and will not suffer thy sons or thy daughters to dwell in thy halls, nor thy faithful wife to fare at large in the city of Ithaca .” So he spoke, and Athena waxed the more wroth at heart,	ἠὲ σοὶ ἀντεβόλησεν ὀρινομένῳ κατὰ δῶμα. ὣς φάτο, τοῦ δʼ ἤκουσε Μέδων πεπνυμένα εἰδώς· πεπτηὼς γὰρ ἔκειτο ὑπὸ θρόνον, ἀμφὶ δὲ δέρμα ἕστο βοὸς νεόδαρτον, ἀλύσκων κῆρα μέλαιναν. αἶψα δʼ ἀπὸ θρόνου ὦρτο, θοῶς δʼ ἀπέδυνε βοείην.
and she rebuked Odysseus with angry words: “Odysseus, no longer hast thou steadfast might nor any valor, such as was thine when for high-born Helen of the white arms thou didst for nine years battle with the Trojans unceasingly, and many men thou slewest in dread conflict,	Τηλέμαχον δʼ ἄρʼ ἔπειτα προσαΐξας λάβε γούνων, καί μιν λισσόμενος ἔπεα πτερόεντα προσηύδα· ὦ φίλʼ, ἐγὼ μὲν ὅδʼ εἰμί, σὺ δʼ ἴσχεο εἰπὲ δὲ πατρὶ μή με περισθενέων δηλήσεται ὀξέϊ χαλκῷ, ἀνδρῶν μνηστήρων κεχολωμένος, οἵ οἱ ἔκειρον
 and by thy counsel was the broad-wayed city of Priam taken. How is it that now, when thou hast come to thy house and thine own possessions, thou shrinkest with wailing from playing the man, and that against the wooers? Nay, friend, come hither and take thy stand by my side, and see my deeds, that thou mayest know what manner of man	κτήματʼ ἐνὶ μεγάροις, σὲ δὲ νήπιοι οὐδὲν ἔτιον. τὸν δʼ ἐπιμειδήσας προσέφη πολύμητις Ὀδυσσεύς· θάρσει, ἐπεὶ δή σʼ οὗτος ἐρύσσατο καὶ ἐσάωσεν, ὄφρα γνῷς κατὰ θυμόν, ἀτὰρ εἴπῃσθα καὶ ἄλλῳ, ὡς κακοεργίης εὐεργεσίη μέγʼ ἀμείνων.
Mentor, son of Alcimus, is to repay kindness in the midst of the foe.” She spoke, but did not give him strength utterly to turn the course of the battle, but still made trial of the might and valor of Odysseus and his glorious son; and for herself,	ἀλλʼ ἐξελθόντες μεγάρων ἕζεσθε θύραζε ἐκ φόνου εἰς αὐλήν, σύ τε καὶ πολύφημος ἀοιδός, ὄφρʼ ἂν ἐγὼ κατὰ δῶμα πονήσομαι ὅττεό με χρή. ὣς φάτο, τὼ δʼ ἔξω βήτην μεγάροιο κιόντε, ἑζέσθην δʼ ἄρα τώ γε Διὸς μεγάλου ποτὶ βωμόν,
she flew up to the roof-beam of the smoky hall, and sat there in the guise of a swallow to look upon. Now the wooers were urged on by Agelaus, son of Damastor, by Eurynomus, and Amphimedon and Demoptolemus and Peisander, son of Polyctor, and wise Polybus, for these were in valiance far the best of all the wooers	πάντοσε παπταίνοντε, φόνον ποτιδεγμένω αἰεί. πάπτηνεν δʼ Ὀδυσεὺς καθʼ ἑὸν δόμον, εἴ τις ἔτʼ ἀνδρῶν ζωὸς ὑποκλοπέοιτο, ἀλύσκων κῆρα μέλαιναν. τοὺς δὲ ἴδεν μάλα πάντας ἐν αἵματι καὶ κονίῃσι πεπτεῶτας πολλούς, ὥστʼ ἰχθύας, οὕς θʼ ἁλιῆες
who still lived and fought for their lives; but the rest the bow and the swiftly-falling arrows had by now laid low. But Agelaus spoke among them, and declared his word to all: “Friends, now at length will this man stay his invincible hands. Lo, Mentor has gone from him, and has but uttered empty boasts,	κοῖλον ἐς αἰγιαλὸν πολιῆς ἔκτοσθε θαλάσσης δικτύῳ ἐξέρυσαν πολυωπῷ· οἱ δέ τε πάντες κύμαθʼ ἁλὸς ποθέοντες ἐπὶ ψαμάθοισι κέχυνται· τῶν μέν τʼ Ἠέλιος φαέθων ἐξείλετο θυμόν· ὣς τότʼ ἄρα μνηστῆρες ἐπʼ ἀλλήλοισι κέχυντο.
and they are left alone there at the outer doors. Therefore hurl not now upon them your long spears all at once, but come, do you six throw first in the hope that Zeus may grant that Odysseus be struck, and that we win glory. Of the rest there is no care, once he shall have fallen.”	δὴ τότε Τηλέμαχον προσέφη πολύμητις Ὀδυσσεύς· Τηλέμαχʼ, εἰ δʼ ἄγε μοι κάλεσον τροφὸν Εὐρύκλειαν, ὄφρα ἔπος εἴπωμι τό μοι καταθύμιόν ἐστιν. ὣς φάτο, Τηλέμαχος δὲ φίλῳ ἐπεπείθετο πατρί, κινήσας δὲ θύρην προσέφη τροφὸν Εὐρύκλειαν·
 So he spoke, and they all hurled their spears, as he bade, eagerly; but Athena made all vain. One man smote the door-post of the well-built hall, another the close-fitting door, another's ashen spear, heavy with bronze, struck upon the wall.	δεῦρο δὴ ὄρσο, γρηῢ παλαιγενές, ἥ τε γυναικῶν δμῳάων σκοπός ἐσσι κατὰ μέγαρʼ ἡμετεράων· ἔρχεο· κικλήσκει σε πατὴρ ἐμός, ὄφρα τι εἴπῃ. ὣς ἄρʼ ἐφώνησεν, τῇ δʼ ἄπτερος ἔπλετο μῦθος, ὤϊξεν δὲ θύρας μεγάρων εὖ ναιεταόντων,
But when they had avoided the spears of the wooers, first among them spoke the much-enduring goodly Odysseus: “Friends, now I give the word that we too cast our spears into the throng of the wooers, who are minded to slay us in addition to their former wrongs.”	βῆ δʼ ἴμεν· αὐτὰρ Τηλέμαχος πρόσθʼ ἡγεμόνευεν. εὗρεν ἔπειτʼ Ὀδυσῆα μετὰ κταμένοισι νέκυσσιν, αἵματι καὶ λύθρῳ πεπαλαγμένον ὥστε λέοντα, ὅς ῥά τε βεβρωκὼς βοὸς ἔρχεται ἀγραύλοιο· πᾶν δʼ ἄρα οἱ στῆθός τε παρήϊά τʼ ἀμφοτέρωθεν
 So he spoke, and they all hurled their sharp spears with sure aim. Odysseus smote Demoptolemus, Telemachus Euryades, the swineherd Elatus, and the herdsmen of the cattle slew Peisander. So these all at the same moment bit the vast floor with their teeth,	αἱματόεντα πέλει, δεινὸς δʼ εἰς ὦπα ἰδέσθαι· ὣς Ὀδυσεὺς πεπάλακτο πόδας καὶ χεῖρας ὕπερθεν. ἡ δʼ ὡς οὖν νέκυάς τε καὶ ἄσπετον εἴσιδεν αἷμα, ἴθυσέν ῥʼ ὀλολύξαι, ἐπεὶ μέγα εἴσιδεν ἔργον· ἀλλʼ Ὀδυσεὺς κατέρυκε καὶ ἔσχεθεν ἱεμένην περ,
and the wooers drew back to the innermost part of the hall. But the others sprang forward and drew forth their spears from the dead bodies. Then again the wooers hurled their sharp spears eagerly, but Athena made them vain, many as they were. One man	καί μιν φωνήσας ἔπεα πτερόεντα προσηύδα· ἐν θυμῷ, γρηῦ, χαῖρε καὶ ἴσχεο μηδʼ ὀλόλυζε· οὐχ ὁσίη κταμένοισιν ἐπʼ ἀνδράσιν εὐχετάασθαι. τούσδε δὲ μοῖρʼ ἐδάμασσε θεῶν καὶ σχέτλια ἔργα· οὔ τινα γὰρ τίεσκον ἐπιχθονίων ἀνθρώπων,
 smote the door-post of the well-built hall, another the close-fitting door, another's ashen spear, heavy with bronze, struck upon the wall. But Amphimedon smote Telemachus on the hand by the wrist, a grazing blow, and the bronze tore the surface of the skin. And Ctesippus with his long spear	οὐ κακὸν οὐδὲ μὲν ἐσθλόν, ὅτις σφέας εἰσαφίκοιτο· τῷ καὶ ἀτασθαλίῃσιν ἀεικέα πότμον ἐπέσπον. ἀλλʼ ἄγε μοι σὺ γυναῖκας ἐνὶ μεγάροις κατάλεξον, αἵ τέ μʼ ἀτιμάζουσι καὶ αἳ νηλείτιδές εἰσιν. τὸν δʼ αὖτε προσέειπε φίλη τροφὸς Εὐρύκλεια·
 grazed the shoulder of Eumaeus above his shield, but the spear flew over and fell upon the ground. Then once more Odysseus, the wise and crafty-minded, and his company hurled their sharp spears into the throng of the wooers, and again Odysseus, the sacker of cities, smote Eurydamas, and Telemachus Amphimedon, the swineherd Polybus,	τοιγὰρ ἐγώ τοι, τέκνον, ἀληθείην καταλέξω. πεντήκοντά τοί εἰσιν ἐνὶ μεγάροισι γυναῖκες δμῳαί, τὰς μέν τʼ ἔργα διδάξαμεν ἐργάζεσθαι, εἴριά τε ξαίνειν καὶ δουλοσύνην ἀνέχεσθαι· τάων δώδεκα πᾶσαι ἀναιδείης ἐπέβησαν,
and thereafter the herdsman of the cattle smote Ctesippus in the breast, and boasted over him, saying: “Son of Polytherses, thou lover of revilings, never more at all do thou speak big, yielding to folly, but leave the matter to the gods, since verily they are mightier far.	οὔτʼ ἐμὲ τίουσαι οὔτʼ αὐτὴν Πηνελόπειαν. Τηλέμαχος δὲ νέον μὲν ἀέξετο, οὐδέ ἑ μήτηρ σημαίνειν εἴασκεν ἐπὶ δμῳῇσι γυναιξίν. ἀλλʼ ἄγʼ ἐγὼν ἀναβᾶσʼ ὑπερώϊα σιγαλόεντα εἴπω σῇ ἀλόχῳ, τῇ τις θεὸς ὕπνον ἐπῶρσε.
 with a spear-thrust full upon the groin, and drove the bronze clean through, and he fell headlong and struck the ground full with his forehead. Then Athena held up her aegis, the bane of mortals, on high from the roof, and the minds of the wooers were panic-stricken, and they fled through the halls like a herd of kine	τὴν δʼ ἀπαμειβόμενος προσέφη πολύμητις Ὀδυσσεύς μή πω τήνδʼ ἐπέγειρε· σὺ δʼ ἐνθάδε εἰπὲ γυναιξὶν ἐλθέμεν, αἵ περ πρόσθεν ἀεικέα μηχανόωντο. ὣς ἄρʼ ἔφη, γρηῢς δὲ διὲκ μεγάροιο βεβήκει ἀγγελέουσα γυναιξὶ καὶ ὀτρυνέουσα νέεσθαι.
 that the darting gad-fly falls upon and drives along in the season of spring, when the long days come. And even as vultures of crooked talons and curved beaks come forth from the mountains and dart upon smaller birds, which scour the plain, flying low beneath the clouds,	αὐτὰρ ὁ Τηλέμαχον καὶ βουκόλον ἠδὲ συβώτην εἰς ἓ καλεσσάμενος ἔπεα πτερόεντα προσηύδα· ἄρχετε νῦν νέκυας φορέειν καὶ ἄνωχθε γυναῖκας· αὐτὰρ ἔπειτα θρόνους περικαλλέας ἠδὲ τραπέζας ὕδατι καὶ σπόγγοισι πολυτρήτοισι καθαίρειν.
and the vultures pounce upon them and slay them, and they have no defence or way of escape, and men rejoice at the chase; even so did those others set upon the wooers and smite them left and right through the hall. And therefrom rose hideous groaning as heads were smitten, and all the floor swam with blood.	αὐτὰρ ἐπὴν δὴ πάντα δόμον κατακοσμήσησθε, δμῳὰς ἐξαγαγόντες ἐϋσταθέος μεγάροιο, μεσσηγύς τε θόλου καὶ ἀμύμονος ἕρκεος αὐλῆς, θεινέμεναι ξίφεσιν τανυήκεσιν, εἰς ὅ κε πασέων ψυχὰς ἐξαφέλησθε καὶ ἐκλελάθωντʼ Ἀφροδίτης,
But Leiodes rushed forward and clasped the knees of Odysseus, and made entreaty to him, and spoke winged words: “By thy knees I beseech thee, Odysseus, and do thou respect me and have pity. For I declare to thee that never yet have I wronged one of the women in thy halls by wanton word or deed; nay,	τὴν ἄρʼ ὑπὸ μνηστῆρσιν ἔχον μίσγοντό τε λάθρη. ὣς ἔφαθʼ, αἱ δὲ γυναῖκες ἀολλέες ἦλθον ἅπασαι, αἴνʼ ὀλοφυρόμεναι, θαλερὸν κατὰ δάκρυ χέουσαι. πρῶτα μὲν οὖν νέκυας φόρεον κατατεθνηῶτας, κὰδ δʼ ἄρʼ ὑπʼ αἰθούσῃ τίθεσαν εὐερκέος αὐλῆς,
I sought to check the other wooers, when any would do such deeds. But they would not hearken to me to withhold their hands from evil, wherefore through their wanton folly they have met a cruel doom. Yet I, the soothsayer among them, that have done no wrong, shall be laid low even as they; so true is it that there is no gratitude in aftertime for good deeds done.”	ἀλλήλοισιν ἐρείδουσαι· σήμαινε δʼ Ὀδυσσεὺς αὐτὸς ἐπισπέρχων· ταὶ δʼ ἐκφόρεον καὶ ἀνάγκῃ. αὐτὰρ ἔπειτα θρόνους περικαλλέας ἠδὲ τραπέζας ὕδατι καὶ σπόγγοισι πολυτρήτοισι κάθαιρον. αὐτὰρ Τηλέμαχος καὶ βουκόλος ἠδὲ συβώτῃς
 Then with an angry glance from beneath his brows Odysseus of many wiles answered him: “If verily thou dost declare thyself the soothsayer among these men, often, I ween, must thou have prayed in the halls that far from me the issue of a joyous return might be removed, and that it might be with thee that my dear wife should go and bear thee children;	λίστροισιν δάπεδον πύκα ποιητοῖο δόμοιο ξῦον· ταὶ δʼ ἐφόρεον δμῳαί, τίθεσαν δὲ θύραζε. αὐτὰρ ἐπειδὴ πᾶν μέγαρον διεκοσμήσαντο, δμῳὰς δʼ ἐξαγαγόντες ἐϋσταθέος μεγάροιο, μεσσηγύς τε θόλου καὶ ἀμύμονος ἕρκεος αὐλῆς,
wherefore thou shalt not escape grievous death.” So saying, he seized in his strong hand a sword that lay near, which Agelaus had let fall to the ground when he was slain, and with this he smote him full upon the neck. And even while he was yet speaking his head was mingled with the dust.	εἴλεον ἐν στείνει, ὅθεν οὔ πως ἦεν ἀλύξαι. τοῖσι δὲ Τηλέμαχος πεπνυμένος ἦρχʼ ἀγορεύειν· μὴ μὲν δὴ καθαρῷ θανάτῳ ἀπὸ θυμὸν ἑλοίμην τάων, αἳ δὴ ἐμῇ κεφαλῇ κατʼ ὀνείδεα χεῦαν μητέρι θʼ ἡμετέρῃ παρά τε μνηστῆρσιν ἴαυον.
 and sit down by the well-built altar of great Zeus, the God of the court, whereon Laertes and Odysseus had burned many things of oxen, or whether he should rush forward and clasp the knees of Odysseus in prayer. And as he pondered this seemed to him the better course, to clasp the knees of Odysseus, son of Laertes.	ὣς ἄρʼ ἔφη, καὶ πεῖσμα νεὸς κυανοπρῴροιο κίονος ἐξάψας μεγάλης περίβαλλε θόλοιο, ὑψόσʼ ἐπεντανύσας, μή τις ποσὶν οὖδας ἵκοιτο. ὡς δʼ ὅτʼ ἂν ἢ κίχλαι τανυσίπτεροι ἠὲ πέλειαι ἕρκει ἐνιπλήξωσι, τό θʼ ἑστήκῃ ἐνὶ θάμνῳ,
So he laid the hollow lyre on the ground between the mixing-bowl and the silver-studded chair, and himself rushed forward and clasped Odysseus by the knees, and made entreaty to him, and spoke winged words: “By thy knees I beseech thee, Odysseus, and do thou respect me and have pity;	αὖλιν ἐσιέμεναι, στυγερὸς δʼ ὑπεδέξατο κοῖτος, ὣς αἵ γʼ ἑξείης κεφαλὰς ἔχον, ἀμφὶ δὲ πάσαις δειρῇσι βρόχοι ἦσαν, ὅπως οἴκτιστα θάνοιεν. ἤσπαιρον δὲ πόδεσσι μίνυνθά περ οὔ τι μάλα δήν. ἐκ δὲ Μελάνθιον ἦγον ἀνὰ πρόθυρόν τε καὶ αὐλήν·
 on thine own self shall sorrow come hereafter, if thou slayest the minstrel, even me, who sing to gods and men. Self-taught am I, and the god has planted in my heart all manner of lays, and worthy am I to sing to thee as to a god; wherefore be not eager to cut my throat.	τοῦ δʼ ἀπὸ μὲν ῥῖνάς τε καὶ οὔατα νηλέϊ χαλκῷ τάμνον, μήδεά τʼ ἐξέρυσαν, κυσὶν ὠμὰ δάσασθαι, χεῖράς τʼ ἠδὲ πόδας κόπτον κεκοτηότι θυμῷ. οἱ μὲν ἔπειτʼ ἀπονιψάμενοι χεῖράς τε πόδας τε εἰς Ὀδυσῆα δόμονδε κίον, τετέλεστο δὲ ἔργον·
Aye, and Telemachus too will bear witness to this, thy dear son, how that through no will or desire of mine I was wont to resort to thy house to sing to the wooers at their feasts, but they, being far more and stronger, led me hither perforce.” So he spoke, and the strong and mighty Telemachus heard him,	αὐτὰρ ὅ γε προσέειπε φίλην τροφὸν Εὐρύκλειαν· οἶσε θέειον, γρηΰ, κακῶν ἄκος, οἶσε δέ μοι πῦρ, ὄφρα θεειώσω μέγαρον· σὺ δὲ Πηνελόπειαν ἐλθεῖν ἐνθάδʼ ἄνωχθι σὺν ἀμφιπόλοισι γυναιξί· πάσας δʼ ὄτρυνον δμῳὰς κατὰ δῶμα νέεσθαι.
and quickly spoke to his father, who was near: “Stay thy hand, and do not wound this guiltless man with the sword. Aye, and let us save also the herald, Medon, who ever cared for me in our house, when I was a child—unless perchance Philoetius has already slain him, or the swineherd,	τὸν δʼ αὖτε προσέειπε φίλη τροφὸς Εὐρύκλεια· ναὶ δὴ ταῦτά γε, τέκνον ἐμόν, κατὰ μοῖραν ἔειπες. ἀλλʼ ἄγε τοι χλαῖνάν τε χιτῶνά τε εἵματʼ ἐνείκω, μηδʼ οὕτω ῥάκεσιν πεπυκασμένος εὐρέας ὤμους ἕσταθʼ ἐνὶ μεγάροισι· νεμεσσητὸν δέ κεν εἴη.
or he met thee as thou didst rage through the house.” So he spoke, and Medon, wise of heart, heard him, for he lay crouching beneath a chair, and had clothed himself in the skin of an ox, newly flayed, seeking to avoid black fate. Straightway he rose from beneath the chair and stripped off the ox-hide,	τὴν δʼ ἀπαμειβόμενος προσέφη πολύμητις Ὀδυσσεύς· πῦρ νῦν μοι πρώτιστον ἐνὶ μεγάροισι γενέσθω. ὣς ἔφατʼ, οὐδʼ ἀπίθησε φίλη τροφὸς Εὐρύκλεια, ἤνεικεν δʼ ἄρα πῦρ καὶ θήϊον· αὐτὰρ Ὀδυσσεὺς εὖ διεθείωσεν μέγαρον καὶ δῶμα καὶ αὐλήν.
and then rushed forward and clasped Telemachus by the knees, and made entreaty to him, and spoke winged words: “Friend, here I am; stay thou thy hand and bid thy father stay his, lest in the greatness of his might he harm me with the sharp bronze in his wrath against the wooers, who wasted his	γρηῢς δʼ αὖτʼ ἀπέβη διὰ δώματα κάλʼ Ὀδυσῆος ἀγγελέουσα γυναιξὶ καὶ ὀτρυνέουσα νέεσθαι· αἱ δʼ ἴσαν ἐκ μεγάροιο δάος μετὰ χερσὶν ἔχουσαι. αἱ μὲν ἄρʼ ἀμφεχέοντο καὶ ἠσπάζοντʼ Ὀδυσῆα, καὶ κύνεον ἀγαπαξόμεναι κεφαλήν τε καὶ ὤμους
possessions in the halls, and in their folly honored thee not at all.” But Odysseus of many wiles smiled, and said to him: “Be of good cheer, for he has delivered thee and saved thee, that thou mayest know in thy heart and tell also to another, how far better is the doing of good deeds than of evil.	χεῖράς τʼ αἰνύμεναι· τὸν δὲ γλυκὺς ἵμερος ᾕρει κλαυθμοῦ καὶ στοναχῆς, γίγνωσκε δʼ ἄρα φρεσὶ πάσας.
 gazing about on every side, ever expecting death. And Odysseus too gazed about all through his house to see if any man yet lived, and was hiding there, seeking to avoid black fate. But he found them one and all fallen in the blood and dust—all the host of them, like fishes that fishermen	γρηῢς δʼ εἰς ὑπερῷʼ ἀνεβήσετο καγχαλόωσα, δεσποίνῃ ἐρέουσα φίλον πόσιν ἔνδον ἐόντα· γούνατα δʼ ἐρρώσαντο, πόδες δʼ ὑπερικταίνοντο. στῆ δʼ ἄρʼ ὑπὲρ κεφαλῆς καί μιν πρὸς μῦθον ἔειπεν·
 have drawn forth in the meshes of their net from the grey sea upon the curving beach, and they all lie heaped upon the sand, longing for the waves of the sea, and the bright sun takes away their life; even so now the wooers lay heaped upon each other.	ἔγρεο, Πηνελόπεια, φίλον τέκος, ὄφρα ἴδηαι ὀφθαλμοῖσι τεοῖσι τά τʼ ἔλδεαι ἤματα πάντα. ἦλθʼ Ὀδυσεὺς καὶ οἶκον ἱκάνεται, ὀψέ περ ἐλθών. μνηστῆρας δʼ ἔκτεινεν ἀγήνορας, οἵ θʼ ἑὸν οἶκον κήδεσκον καὶ κτήματʼ ἔδον βιόωντό τε παῖδα.
Then Odysseus of many wiles spoke to Telemachus: “Telemachus, go call me the nurse Eurycleia, that I may tell her the word that is in my mind.” So he spoke, and Telemachus hearkened to his dear father, and shaking the door said to Eurycleia:	τὴν δʼ αὖτε προσέειπε περίφρων Πηνελόπεια· μαῖα φίλη, μάργην σε θεοὶ θέσαν, οἵ τε δύνανται ἄφρονα ποιῆσαι καὶ ἐπίφρονά περ μάλʼ ἐόντα, καί τε χαλιφρονέοντα σαοφροσύνης ἐπέβησαν· οἵ σέ περ ἔβλαψαν· πρὶν δὲ φρένας αἰσίμη ἦσθα.
“Up and hither, aged wife, that hast charge of all our woman servants in the halls. Come, my father calls thee, that he may tell thee somewhat.” So he spoke, but her word remained unwinged; she opened the doors of the stately hall,	τίπτε με λωβεύεις πολυπενθέα θυμὸν ἔχουσαν ταῦτα παρὲξ ἐρέουσα καὶ ἐξ ὕπνου μʼ ἀνεγείρεις ἡδέος, ὅς μʼ ἐπέδησε φίλα βλέφαρʼ ἀμφικαλύψας; οὐ γάρ πω τοιόνδε κατέδραθον, ἐξ οὗ Ὀδυσσεὺς ᾤχετʼ ἐποψόμενος Κακοΐλιον οὐκ ὀνομαστήν.
 and came forth, and Telemachus led the way before her. There she found Odysseus amid the bodies of the slain, all befouled with blood and filth, like a lion that comes from feeding on an ox of the farmstead, and all his breast and his cheeks on either side	ἀλλʼ ἄγε νῦν κατάβηθι καὶ ἂψ ἔρχευ μέγαρόνδε. εἰ γάρ τίς μʼ ἄλλη γε γυναικῶν, αἵ μοι ἔασι, ταῦτʼ ἐλθοῦσʼ ἤγγειλε καὶ ἐξ ὕπνου ἀνέγειρεν, τῷ κε τάχα στυγερῶς μιν ἐγὼν ἀπέπεμψα νέεσθαι αὖτις ἔσω μέγαρον· σὲ δὲ τοῦτό γε γῆρας ὀνήσει.
 are stained with blood, and he is terrible to look upon; even so was Odysseus befouled, his feet and his hands above. But she, when she beheld the corpses and the great welter of blood, made ready to utter loud cries of joy, seeing what a deed had been wrought. But Odysseus stayed and checked her in her eagerness,	τὴν δʼ αὖτε προσέειπε φίλη τροφὸς Εὐρύκλεια· οὔ τί σε λωβεύω, τέκνον φίλον, ἀλλʼ ἔτυμόν τοι ἦλθʼ Ὀδυσεὺς καὶ οἶκον ἱκάνεται, ὡς ἀγορεύω, ὁ ξεῖνος, τὸν πάντες ἀτίμων ἐν μεγάροισι. Τηλέμαχος δʼ ἄρα μιν πάλαι ᾔδεεν ἔνδον ἐόντα,
and spoke and addressed her with winged words: “In thine own heart rejoice, old dame, but refrain thyself and cry not out aloud: an unholy thing is it to boast over slain men. These men here has the fate of the gods destroyed and their own reckless deeds, for they honored no one of men upon the earth,	ἀλλὰ σαοφροσύνῃσι νοήματα πατρὸς ἔκευθεν, ὄφρʼ ἀνδρῶν τίσαιτο βίην ὑπερηνορεόντων. ὣς ἔφαθʼ, ἡ δʼ ἐχάρη καὶ ἀπὸ λέκτροιο θοροῦσα γρηῒ περιπλέχθη, βλεφάρων δʼ ἀπὸ δάκρυον ἧκεν· καί μιν φωνήσασʼ ἔπεα πτερόεντα προσηύδα·
were he evil or good, whosoever came among them; wherefore by their wanton folly they brought on themselves a shameful death. But come, name thou over to me the women in the halls, which ones dishonor me and which are guiltless.” Then the dear nurse Eurycleia answered him:	εἰ δʼ ἄγε δή μοι, μαῖα φίλη, νημερτὲς ἐνίσπες, εἰ ἐτεὸν δὴ οἶκον ἱκάνεται, ὡς ἀγορεύεις, ὅππως δὴ μνηστῆρσιν ἀναιδέσι χεῖρας ἐφῆκε μοῦνος ἐών, οἱ δʼ αἰὲν ἀολλέες ἔνδον ἔμιμνον. τὴν δʼ αὖτε προσέειπε φίλη τροφὸς Εὐρύκλεια·
 “Then verily, my child, will I tell thee all the truth. Fifty women servants hast thou in the halls, women that we have taught to do their work, to card the wool and bear the lot of slaves. Of these twelve in all have set their feet in the way of shamelessness,	οὐκ ἴδον, οὐ πυθόμην, ἀλλὰ στόνον οἶον ἄκουσα κτεινομένων· ἡμεῖς δὲ μυχῷ θαλάμων εὐπήκτων ἥμεθʼ ἀτυζόμεναι, σανίδες δʼ ἔχον εὖ ἀραρυῖαι, πρίν γʼ ὅτε δή με σὸς υἱὸς ἀπὸ μεγάροιο κάλεσσε Τηλέμαχος· τὸν γάρ ῥα πατὴρ προέηκε καλέσσαι.
and regard not me nor Penelope herself. And Telemachus is but newly grown to manhood, and his mother would not suffer him to rule over the women servants. But come, let me go up to the bright upper chamber and bear word to thy wife, on whom some god has sent sleep.”	εὗρον ἔπειτʼ Ὀδυσῆα μετὰ κταμένοισι νέκυσσιν ἑσταόθʼ· οἱ δέ μιν ἀμφί, κραταίπεδον οὖδας ἔχοντες, κείατʼ ἐπʼ ἀλλήλοισιν· ἰδοῦσά κε θυμὸν ἰάνθης. νῦν δʼ οἱ μὲν δὴ πάντες ἐπʼ αὐλείῃσι θύρῃσιν
Then Odysseus of many wiles answered her, and said: “Wake her not yet, but do thou bid come hither the women, who in time past have contrived shameful deeds.” So he spoke, and the old dame went forth through the hall to bear tidings to the women, and bid them come; but Odysseus called to him Telemachus and the neatherd and the swineherd, and spoke to them winged words: “Begin now to bear forth the dead bodies and bid the women help you, and thereafter cleanse the beautiful chairs and the tables with water and porous sponges. But when you have set all the house in order, lead the women forth from the well-built hall to a place between the dome and the goodly fence of the court, and there strike them down with your long swords, until you take away the life from them all, and they forget the love which they had at the bidding of the wooers, when they lay with them in secret.” So he spoke, and the women came all in a throng, wailing terribly and shedding big tears. First they bore forth the bodies of the slain and set them down beneath the portico of the well-fenced court, propping them one against the other; and Odysseus himself gave them orders and hastened on the work, and they bore the bodies forth perforce. Then they cleansed the beautiful high seats and the tables with water and porous sponges. But Telemachus and the neatherd and the swineherd scraped with hoes the floor of the well-built house, and the women bore the scrapings forth and threw them out of doors. But when they had set in order all the hall, they led the women forth from the well-built hall to a place between the dome and the goodly fence of the court, and shut them up in a narrow space, whence it was in no wise possible to escape. Then wise Telemachus was the first to speak to the others, saying: “Let it be by no clean death that I take the lives of these women, who on my own head have poured reproaches and on my mother, and were wont to lie with the wooers.” So he spoke, and tied the cable of a dark-prowed ship to a great pillar and flung it round the dome, stretching it on high that none might reach the ground with her feet. And as when long-winged thrushes or doves fall into a snare that is set in a thicket, as they seek to reach their resting-place, and hateful is the bed that gives them welcome, even so the women held their heads in a row, and round the necks of all nooses were laid, that they might die most piteously. And they writhed a little while with their feet, but not long. Then forth they led Melanthius through the doorway and the court, and cut off his nostrils and his ears with the pitiless bronze, and drew out his vitals for the dogs to eat raw, and cut off his hands and his feet in their furious wrath. Thereafter they washed their hands and feet, and went into the house to Odysseus, and the work was done. But Odysseus said to the dear nurse Eurycleia: “Bring sulphur, old dame, to cleanse from pollution, and bring me fire, that I may purge the hall; and do thou bid Penelope come hither with her handmaidens, and order all the women in the house to come.” Then the dear nurse Eurycleia answered him: “Yea, all this, my child, hast thou spoken aright. But come, let me bring thee a cloak and a tunic for raiment, and do not thou stand thus in the halls with thy broad shoulders wrapped in rags; that were a cause for blame.” Then Odysseus of many wiles answered her: “First of all let a fire now be made me in the hall.” So he spoke, and the dear nurse Eurycleia did not disobey, but brought fire and sulphur; but Odysseus throughly purged the hall and the house and the court. Then the old dame went back through the fair house of Odysseus to bear tidings to the women and bid them come; and they came forth from their hall with torches in their hands. They thronged about Odysseus and embraced him, and clasped and kissed his head and shoulders and his hands in loving welcome; and a sweet longing seized him to weep and wail, for in his heart he knew them all.	ἀθρόοι, αὐτὰρ ὁ δῶμα θεειοῦται περικαλλές, πῦρ μέγα κηάμενος· σὲ δέ με προέηκε καλέσσαι. ἀλλʼ ἕπευ, ὄφρα σφῶϊν ἐϋφροσύνης ἐπιβῆτον ἀμφοτέρω φίλον ἦτορ, ἐπεὶ κακὰ πολλὰ πέποσθε. νῦν δʼ ἤδη τόδε μακρὸν ἐέλδωρ ἐκτετέλεσται·
Then the old dame went up to the upper chamber, laughing aloud, to tell her mistress that her dear husband was in the house. Her knees moved nimbly, but her feet trotted along beneath her; and she stood above her lady's head, and spoke to her, and said:	οἶσθα γὰρ ὥς κʼ ἀσπαστὸς ἐνὶ μεγάροισι φανείη πᾶσι, μάλιστα δʼ ἐμοί τε καὶ υἱέϊ, τὸν τεκόμεσθα· ἀλλʼ οὐκ ἔσθʼ ὅδε μῦθος ἐτήτυμος, ὡς ἀγορεύεις, ἀλλά τις ἀθανάτων κτεῖνε μνηστῆρας ἀγαυούς, ὕβριν ἀγασσάμενος θυμαλγέα καὶ κακὰ ἔργα.
“Awake, Penelope, dear child, that with thine own eyes thou mayest see what thou desirest all thy days. Odysseus is here, and has come home, late though his coming has been, and has slain the proud wooers who vexed his house, and devoured his substance, and oppressed his son.”	οὔ τινα γὰρ τίεσκον ἐπιχθονίων ἀνθρώπων, οὐ κακὸν οὐδὲ μὲν ἐσθλόν, ὅτις σφέας εἰσαφίκοιτο· τῷ διʼ ἀτασθαλίας ἔπαθον κακόν· αὐτὰρ Ὀδυσσεὺς ὤλεσε τηλοῦ νόστον Ἀχαιΐδος, ὤλετο δʼ αὐτός. τὴν δʼ ἠμείβετʼ ἔπειτα φίλη τροφὸς Εὐρύκλεια·
 Then wise Penelope answered her: “Dear nurse, the gods have made thee mad, they who can make foolish even one who is full wise, and set the simple-minded in the paths of understanding; it is they that have marred thy wits, though heretofore thou wast sound of mind.	τέκνον ἐμόν, ποῖόν σε ἔπος φύγεν ἕρκος ὀδόντων, ἣ πόσιν ἔνδον ἐόντα παρʼ ἐσχάρῃ οὔ ποτʼ ἔφησθα οἴκαδʼ ἐλεύσεσθαι· θυμὸς δέ τοι αἰὲν ἄπιστος. ἀλλʼ ἄγε τοι καὶ σῆμα ἀριφραδὲς ἄλλο τι εἴπω, οὐλήν, τήν ποτέ μιν σῦς ἤλασε λευκῷ ὀδόντι.
Why dost thou mock me, who have a heart full of sorrow, to tell me this wild tale, and dost rouse me out of slumber, the sweet slumber that bound me and enfolded my eyelids? For never yet have I slept so sound since the day when Odysseus went forth to see evil Ilios that should not be named.	τὴν ἀπονίζουσα φρασάμην, ἔθελον δὲ σοὶ αὐτῇ εἰπέμεν· ἀλλά με κεῖνος ἑλὼν ἐπὶ μάστακα χερσὶν οὐκ ἔα εἰπέμεναι πολυϊδρείῃσι νόοιο. ἀλλʼ ἕπευ· αὐτὰρ ἐγὼν ἐμέθεν περιδώσομαι αὐτῆς, αἴ κέν σʼ ἐξαπάφω, κτεῖναί μʼ οἰκτίστῳ ὀλέθρῳ.
Nay come now, go down and back to the women's hall, for if any other of the women that are mine had come and told me this, and had roused me out of sleep, straightway would I have sent her back in sorry wise to return again to the hall, but to thee old age shall bring this profit.”	τὴν δʼ ἠμείβετʼ ἔπειτα περίφρων Πηνελόπεια· μαῖα φίλη, χαλεπόν σε θεῶν αἰειγενετάων δήνεα εἴρυσθαι, μὰλα περ πολύϊδριν ἐοῦσαν. ἀλλʼ ἔμπης ἴομεν μετὰ παῖδʼ ἐμόν, ὄφρα ἴδωμαι ἄνδρας μνηστῆρας τεθνηότας, ἠδʼ ὃς ἔπεφνεν.
 Then the dear nurse Eurycleia answered her: “I mock thee not, dear child, but in very truth Odysseus is here, and has come home, even as I tell thee. He is that stranger to whom all men did dishonor in the halls. But Telemachus long ago knew that he was here,	ὣς φαμένη κατέβαινʼ ὑπερώϊα· πολλὰ δέ οἱ κῆρ ὥρμαινʼ, ἢ ἀπάνευθε φίλον πόσιν ἐξερεείνοι, ἦ παρστᾶσα κύσειε κάρη καὶ χεῖρε λαβοῦσα. ἡ δʼ ἐπεὶ εἰσῆλθεν καὶ ὑπέρβη λάϊνον οὐδόν, ἕζετʼ ἔπειτʼ Ὀδυσῆος ἐναντίη, ἐν πυρὸς αὐγῇ,
yet in his prudence he hid the purpose of his father, till he should take vengeance on the violence of overweening men.” So she spoke, and Penelope was glad, and she leapt from her bed and flung her arms about the old woman and let the tears fall from her eyelids; and she spoke, and addressed her with winged words:	τοίχου τοῦ ἑτέρου· ὁ δʼ ἄρα πρὸς κίονα μακρὴν ἧστο κάτω ὁρόων, ποτιδέγμενος εἴ τί μιν εἴποι ἰφθίμη παράκοιτις, ἐπεὶ ἴδεν ὀφθαλμοῖσιν. ἡ δʼ ἄνεω δὴν ἧστο, τάφος δέ οἱ ἦτορ ἵκανεν· ὄψει δʼ ἄλλοτε μέν μιν ἐνωπαδίως ἐσίδεσκεν,
“Come now, dear nurse, I pray thee tell me truly, if verily he has come home, as thou sayest, how he put forth his hands upon the shameless wooers, all alone as he was, while they remained always in a body in the house.” Then the dear nurse Eurycleia answered her:	ἄλλοτε δʼ ἀγνώσασκε κακὰ χροῒ εἵματʼ ἔχοντα. Τηλέμαχος δʼ ἐνένιπεν ἔπος τʼ ἔφατʼ ἔκ τʼ ὀνόμαζε· μῆτερ ἐμή, δύσμητερ, ἀπηνέα θυμὸν ἔχουσα, τίφθʼ οὕτω πατρὸς νοσφίζεαι, οὐδὲ παρʼ αὐτὸν ἑζομένη μύθοισιν ἀνείρεαι οὐδὲ μεταλλᾷς;
 “I saw not, I asked not; only I heard the groaning of men that were being slain. As for us women, we sat terror-stricken in the innermost part of our well-built chambers, and the close-fitting doors shut us in, until the hour when thy son Telemachus called me from the hall, for his father had sent him forth to call me.	οὐ μέν κʼ ἄλλη γʼ ὧδε γυνὴ τετληότι θυμῷ ἀνδρὸς ἀφεσταίη, ὅς οἱ κακὰ πολλὰ μογήσας ἔλθοι ἐεικοστῷ ἔτεϊ ἐς πατρίδα γαῖαν· σοὶ δʼ αἰεὶ κραδίη στερεωτέρη ἐστὶ λίθοιο. τὸν δʼ αὖτε προσέειπε περίφρων Πηνελόπεια·
Then I found Odysseus standing among the bodies of the slain, and they, stretched all around him on the hard floor, lay one upon the other; the sight would have warmed thy heart with cheer. And now the bodies are all gathered together at the gates of the court,	τέκνον ἐμόν, θυμός μοι ἐνὶ στήθεσσι τέθηπεν, οὐδέ τι προσφάσθαι δύναμαι ἔπος οὐδʼ ἐρέεσθαι οὐδʼ εἰς ὦπα ἰδέσθαι ἐναντίον. εἰ δʼ ἐτεὸν δὴ ἔστʼ Ὀδυσεὺς καὶ οἶκον ἱκάνεται, ἦ μάλα νῶϊ γνωσόμεθʼ ἀλλήλων καὶ λώϊον· ἔστι γὰρ ἡμῖν
 but he is purging the fair house with sulphur, and has kindled a great fire, and sent me forth to call thee. Nay, come with me, that the hearts of you two may enter into joy, for you have suffered many woes. But now at length has this thy long desire been fulfilled:	σήμαθʼ, ἃ δὴ καὶ νῶϊ κεκρυμμένα ἴδμεν ἀπʼ ἄλλων. ὣς φάτο, μείδησεν δὲ πολύτλας δῖος Ὀδυσσεύς, αἶψα δὲ Τηλέμαχον ἔπεα πτερόεντα προσηύδα· Τηλέμαχʼ, ἦ τοι μητέρʼ ἐνὶ μεγάροισιν ἔασον πειράζειν ἐμέθεν· τάχα δὲ φράσεται καὶ ἄρειον.
he has come himself, alive to his own hearth, and he has found both thee and his son in the halls; while as for those, even the wooers, who wrought him evil, on them has he taken vengeance one and all in his house.” Then wise Penelope answered her: “Dear nurse, boast not yet loudly over them with laughter.	νῦν δʼ ὅττι ῥυπόω, κακὰ δὲ χροῒ εἵματα εἷμαι, τοὔνεκʼ ἀτιμάζει με καὶ οὔ πω φησὶ τὸν εἶναι. ἡμεῖς δὲ φραζώμεθʼ ὅπως ὄχʼ ἄριστα γένηται. καὶ γάρ τίς θʼ ἕνα φῶτα κατακτείνας ἐνὶ δήμῳ, ᾧ μὴ πολλοὶ ἔωσιν ἀοσσητῆρες ὀπίσσω,
 Thou knowest how welcome the sight of him in the halls would be to all, but above all to me and to his son, born of us two. But this is no true tale, as thou tellest it; nay, some one of the immortals has slain the lordly wooers in wrath at their grievous insolence and their evil deeds.	φεύγει πηούς τε προλιπὼν καὶ πατρίδα γαῖαν· ἡμεῖς δʼ ἕρμα πόληος ἀπέκταμεν, οἳ μέγʼ ἄριστοι κούρων εἰν Ἰθάκῃ· τὰ δέ σε φράζεσθαι ἄνωγα. τὸν δʼ αὖ Τηλέμαχος πεπνυμένος ἀντίον ηὔδα· αὐτὸς ταῦτά γε λεῦσσε, πάτερ φίλε· σὴν γὰρ ἀρίστην
For they honored no one among men upon the earth, were he evil or good, whosoever came among them; therefore it is through their own wanton folly that they have suffered evil. But Odysseus far away has lost his return to the land of Achaea , and is lost himself.” Then the dear nurse Eurycleia answered her:	μῆτιν ἐπʼ ἀνθρώπους φάσʼ ἔμμεναι, οὐδέ κέ τίς τοι ἄλλος ἀνὴρ ἐρίσειε καταθνητῶν ἀνθρώπων. ἡμεῖς δʼ ἐμμεμαῶτες ἅμʼ ἑψόμεθʼ, οὐδέ τί φημι ἀλκῆς δευήσεσθαι, ὅση δύναμίς γε πάρεστιν. τὸν δʼ ἀπαμειβόμενος προσέφη πολύμητις Ὀδυσσεύς
 “My child, what a word has escaped the barrier of thy teeth, in that thou saidst that thy husband, who even now is here, at his own hearth, would never more return! Thy heart is ever unbelieving. Nay come, I will tell thee a manifest sign besides, even the scar of the wound which long ago the boar dealt him with his white tusk.	τοιγὰρ ἐγὼν ἐρέω ὥς μοι δοκεῖ εἶναι ἄριστα. πρῶτα μὲν ἂρ λούσασθε καὶ ἀμφιέσασθε χιτῶνας, δμῳὰς δʼ ἐν μεγάροισιν ἀνώγετε εἵμαθʼ ἑλέσθαι· αὐτὰρ θεῖος ἀοιδὸς ἔχων φόρμιγγα λίγειαν ἡμῖν ἡγείσθω φιλοπαίγμονος ὀρχηθμοῖο,
This I marked while I washed his feet, and was fain to tell it to thee as well, but he laid his hand upon my mouth, and in the great wisdom of his heart would not suffer me to speak. So come with me; but I will set my very life at stake that, if I deceive thee, thou shouldest slay me by a most pitiful death.”	ὥς κέν τις φαίη γάμον ἔμμεναι ἐκτὸς ἀκούων, ἢ ἀνʼ ὁδὸν στείχων, ἢ οἳ περιναιετάουσι· μὴ πρόσθε κλέος εὐρὺ φόνου κατὰ ἄστυ γένηται ἀνδρῶν μνηστήρων, πρίν γʼ ἡμέας ἐλθέμεν ἔξω ἀγρὸν ἐς ἡμέτερον πολυδένδρεον· ἔνθα δʼ ἔπειτα
Then wise Penelope answered her: “Dear nurse, it is hard for thee to comprehend the counsels of the gods that are forever, how wise soever thou art. Nevertheless let us go to my son, that I may see the wooers dead and him that slew them.”	φρασσόμεθʼ ὅττι κε κέρδος Ὀλύμπιος ἐγγυαλίξῃ. ὣς ἔφαθʼ, οἱ δʼ ἄρα τοῦ μάλα μὲν κλύον ἠδʼ ἐπίθοντο πρῶτα μὲν οὖν λούσαντο καὶ ἀμφιέσαντο χιτῶνας, ὅπλισθεν δὲ γυναῖκες· ὁ δʼ εἵλετο θεῖος ἀοιδὸς φόρμιγγα γλαφυρήν, ἐν δέ σφισιν ἵμερον ὦρσε
 So saying, she went down from the upper chamber, and much her heart pondered whether she should stand aloof and question her dear husband, or whether she should go up to him, and clasp and kiss his head and hands. But when she had come in and had passed over the stone threshold, she sat down opposite Odysseus in the light of the fire	μολπῆς τε γλυκερῆς καὶ ἀμύμονος ὀρχηθμοῖο. τοῖσιν δὲ μέγα δῶμα περιστεναχίζετο ποσσὶν ἀνδρῶν παιζόντων καλλιζώνων τε γυναικῶν. ὧδε δέ τις εἴπεσκε δόμων ἔκτοσθεν ἀκούων· ἦ μάλα δή τις ἔγημε πολυμνήστην βασίλειαν·
 beside the further wall; but he was sitting by a tall pillar, looking down, and waiting to see whether his noble wife would say aught to him, when her eyes beheld him. Howbeit she sat long in silence, and amazement came upon her soul; and now with her eyes she would look full upon his face, and now again	σχετλίη, οὐδʼ ἔτλη πόσιος οὗ κουριδίοιο εἴρυσθαι μέγα δῶμα διαμπερές, ἧος ἵκοιτο. ὣς ἄρα τις εἴπεσκε, τὰ δʼ οὐκ ἴσαν ὡς ἐτέτυκτο. αὐτὰρ Ὀδυσσῆα μεγαλήτορα ᾧ ἐνὶ οἴκῳ Εὐρυνόμη ταμίη λοῦσεν καὶ χρῖσεν ἐλαίῳ,
she would fail to know him, for that he had upon him mean raiment. But Telemachus rebuked her, and spoke, and addressed her: “My mother, cruel mother, that hast an unyielding heart, why dost thou thus hold aloof from my father, and dost not sit by his side and ask and question him?	ἀμφὶ δέ μιν φᾶρος καλὸν βάλεν ἠδὲ χιτῶνα· αὐτὰρ κὰκ κεφαλῆς κάλλος πολὺ χεῦεν Ἀθήνη μείζονά τʼ εἰσιδέειν καὶ πάσσονα· κὰδ δὲ κάρητος οὔλας ἧκε κόμας, ὑακινθίνῳ ἄνθει ὁμοίας. ὡς δʼ ὅτε τις χρυσὸν περιχεύεται ἀργύρῳ ἀνὴρ
No other woman would harden her heart as thou dost, and stand aloof from her husband, who after many grievous toils had come back to her in the twentieth year to his native land: but thy heart is ever harder than stone.” Then wise Penelope answered him:	ἴδρις, ὃν Ἥφαιστος δέδαεν καὶ Παλλὰς Ἀθήνη τέχνην παντοίην, χαρίεντα δὲ ἔργα τελείει· ὣς μὲν τῷ περίχευε χάριν κεφαλῇ τε καὶ ὤμοις. ἐκ δʼ ἀσαμίνθου βῆ δέμας ἀθανάτοισιν ὁμοῖος· ἂψ δʼ αὖτις κατʼ ἄρʼ ἕζετʼ ἐπὶ θρόνου ἔνθεν ἀνέστη,
 “My child, the heart in my breast is lost in wonder, and I have no power to speak at all, nor to ask a question, nor to look him in the face. But if in very truth he is Odysseus, and has come home, we two shall surely know one another more certainly;	ἀντίον ἧς ἀλόχου, καί μιν πρὸς μῦθον ἔειπε· δαιμονίη, περί σοί γε γυναικῶν θηλυτεράων κῆρ ἀτέραμνον ἔθηκαν Ὀλύμπια δώματʼ ἔχοντες· οὐ μέν κʼ ἄλλη γʼ ὧδε γυνὴ τετληότι θυμῷ ἀνδρὸς ἀφεσταίη, ὅς οἱ κακὰ πολλὰ μογήσας
for we have signs which we two alone know, signs hidden from others.” So she spoke, and the much-enduring, goodly Odysseus smiled, and straightway spoke to Telemachus winged words: “Telemachus, suffer now thy mother to test me in the halls; presently shall she win more certain knowledge.	ἔλθοι ἐεικοστῷ ἔτεϊ ἐς πατρίδα γαῖαν. ἀλλʼ ἄγε μοι, μαῖα, στόρεσον λέχος, ὄφρα καὶ αὐτὸς λέξομαι· ἦ γὰρ τῇ γε σιδήρεον ἐν φρεσὶ ἦτορ. τὸν δʼ αὖτε προσέειπε περίφρων Πηνελόπεια· δαιμόνιʼ, οὔτʼ ἄρ τι μεγαλίζομαι οὔτʼ ἀθερίζω
 But now because I am foul, and am clad about my body in mean clothing, she scorns me, and will not yet admit that I am he. But for us, let us take thought how all may be the very best. For whoso has slain but one man in a land, even though it be a man that leaves not many behind to avenge him,	οὔτε λίην ἄγαμαι, μάλα δʼ εὖ οἶδʼ οἷος ἔησθα ἐξ Ἰθάκης ἐπὶ νηὸς ἰὼν δολιχηρέτμοιο. ἀλλʼ ἄγε οἱ στόρεσον πυκινὸν λέχος, Εὐρύκλεια, ἐκτὸς ἐϋσταθέος θαλάμου, τόν ῥʼ αὐτὸς ἐποίει· ἔνθα οἱ ἐκθεῖσαι πυκινὸν λέχος ἐμβάλετʼ εὐνήν,
he goes into exile, and leaves his kindred and his native land; but we have slain those who were the very stay of the city, far the noblest of the youths of Ithaca . Of this I bid thee take thought.” Then wise Telemachus answered him: “Do thou thyself look to this, dear father; for thy	κώεα καὶ χλαίνας καὶ ῥήγεα σιγαλόεντα. ὣς ἄρʼ ἔφη πόσιος πειρωμένη· αὐτὰρ Ὀδυσσεὺς ὀχθήσας ἄλοχον προσεφώνεε κεδνὰ ἰδυῖαν· ὦ γύναι, ἦ μάλα τοῦτο ἔπος θυμαλγὲς ἔειπες· τίς δέ μοι ἄλλοσε θῆκε λέχος; χαλεπὸν δέ κεν εἴη
counsel, they say, is the best among men, nor could any other of mortal men vie with thee. As for us, we will follow with thee eagerly, nor methinks shall we be wanting in valor, so far as we have strength.” Then Odysseus of many wiles answered him and said:	καὶ μάλʼ ἐπισταμένῳ, ὅτε μὴ θεὸς αὐτὸς ἐπελθὼν ῥηϊδίως ἐθέλων θείη ἄλλῃ ἐνὶ χώρῃ. ἀνδρῶν δʼ οὔ κέν τις ζωὸς βροτός, οὐδὲ μάλʼ ἡβῶν, ῥεῖα μετοχλίσσειεν, ἐπεὶ μέγα σῆμα τέτυκται ἐν λέχει ἀσκητῷ· τὸ δʼ ἐγὼ κάμον οὐδέ τις ἄλλος.
 “Then will I tell thee what seems to me to be the best way. First bathe yourselves, and put on your tunics, and bid the handmaids in the halls to take their raiment. But let the divine minstrel with his clear-toned lyre in hand be our leader in the gladsome dance,	θάμνος ἔφυ τανύφυλλος ἐλαίης ἕρκεος ἐντός, ἀκμηνὸς θαλέθων· πάχετος δʼ ἦν ἠΰτε κίων. τῷ δʼ ἐγὼ ἀμφιβαλὼν θάλαμον δέμον, ὄφρʼ ἐτέλεσσα, πυκνῇσιν λιθάδεσσι, καὶ εὖ καθύπερθεν ἔρεψα, κολλητὰς δʼ ἐπέθηκα θύρας, πυκινῶς ἀραρυίας.
 that any man who hears the sound from without, whether a passer-by or one of those who dwell around, may say that it is a wedding feast; and so the rumor of the slaying of the wooers shall not be spread abroad throughout the city before we go forth to our well-wooded farm. There	καὶ τότʼ ἔπειτʼ ἀπέκοψα κόμην τανυφύλλου ἐλαίης, κορμὸν δʼ ἐκ ῥίζης προταμὼν ἀμφέξεσα χαλκῷ εὖ καὶ ἐπισταμένως, καὶ ἐπὶ στάθμην ἴθυνα, ἑρμῖνʼ ἀσκήσας, τέτρηνα δὲ πάντα τερέτρῳ. ἐκ δὲ τοῦ ἀρχόμενος λέχος ἔξεον, ὄφρʼ ἐτέλεσσα,
shall we afterwards devise whatever advantage the Olympian may vouchsafe us.” So he spoke, and they all readily hearkened and obeyed. First they bathed and put on their tunics, and the women arrayed themselves, and the divine minstrel took the hollow lyre and aroused in them the desire	δαιδάλλων χρυσῷ τε καὶ ἀργύρῳ ἠδʼ ἐλέφαντι· ἐκ δʼ ἐτάνυσσα ἱμάντα βοὸς φοίνικι φαεινόν. οὕτω τοι τόδε σῆμα πιφαύσκομαι· οὐδέ τι οἶδα, ἤ μοι ἔτʼ ἔμπεδόν ἐστι, γύναι, λέχος, ἦέ τις ἤδη ἀνδρῶν ἄλλοσε θῆκε, ταμὼν ὕπο πυθμένʼ ἐλαίης.
of sweet song and goodly dance. So the great hall resounded all about with the tread of dancing men and of fair-girdled women; and thus would one speak who heard the noise from without the house: “Aye, verily some one has wedded the queen wooed of many.	ὣς φάτο, τῆς δʼ αὐτοῦ λύτο γούνατα καὶ φίλον ἦτορ, σήματʼ ἀναγνούσῃ τά οἱ ἔμπεδα πέφραδʼ Ὀδυσσεύς· δακρύσασα δʼ ἔπειτʼ ἰθὺς δράμεν, ἀμφὶ δὲ χεῖρας δειρῇ βάλλʼ Ὀδυσῆϊ, κάρη δʼ ἔκυσʼ ἠδὲ προσηύδα· μή μοι, Ὀδυσσεῦ, σκύζευ, ἐπεὶ τά περ ἄλλα μάλιστα
Cruel she was, nor had she the heart to keep the great house of her wedded husband to the end, even till he should come.” So they would say, but they knew not how these things were. Meanwhile the housewife Eurynome bathed the great-hearted Odysseus in his house, and anointed him with oil,	ἀνθρώπων πέπνυσο· θεοὶ δʼ ὤπαζον ὀϊζύν, οἳ νῶϊν ἀγάσαντο παρʼ ἀλλήλοισι μένοντε ἥβης ταρπῆναι καὶ γήραος οὐδὸν ἱκέσθαι. αὐτὰρ μὴ νῦν μοι τόδε χώεο μηδὲ νεμέσσα, οὕνεκά σʼ οὐ τὸ πρῶτον, ἐπεὶ ἴδον, ὧδʼ ἀγάπησα.
 and cast about him a fair cloak and a tunic; and over his head Athena shed abundant beauty, making him taller to look upon and mightier, and from his head she made locks to flow in curls like the hyacinth flower. And as when a man overlays silver with gold,	αἰεὶ γάρ μοι θυμὸς ἐνὶ στήθεσσι φίλοισιν ἐρρίγει μή τίς με βροτῶν ἀπάφοιτο ἔπεσσιν ἐλθών· πολλοὶ γὰρ κακὰ κέρδεα βουλεύουσιν. οὐδέ κεν Ἀργείη Ἑλένη, Διὸς ἐκγεγαυῖα, ἀνδρὶ παρʼ ἀλλοδαπῷ ἐμίγη φιλότητι καὶ εὐνῇ,
 a cunning workman whom Hephaestus and Pallas Athena have taught all manner of craft, and full of grace is the work he produces, even so the goddess shed grace on his head and shoulders, and forth from the bath he came, in form like unto the immortals. Then he sat down again on the chair from which he had risen,	εἰ ᾔδη ὅ μιν αὖτις ἀρήϊοι υἷες Ἀχαιῶν ἀξέμεναι οἶκόνδε φίλην ἐς πατρίδʼ ἔμελλον. τὴν δʼ ἦ τοι ῥέξαι θεὸς ὤρορεν ἔργον ἀεικές· τὴν δʼ ἄτην οὐ πρόσθεν ἑῷ ἐγκάτθετο θυμῷ λυγρήν, ἐξ ἧς πρῶτα καὶ ἡμέας ἵκετο πένθος.
opposite his wife; and he spoke to her and said: “Strange lady! to thee beyond all women have the dwellers on Olympus given a heart that cannot be softened. No other woman would harden her heart as thou dost, and stand aloof from her husband who after many grievous toils	νῦν δʼ, ἐπεὶ ἤδη σήματʼ ἀριφραδέα κατέλεξας εὐνῆς ἡμετέρης, ἣν οὐ βροτὸς ἄλλος ὀπώπει, ἀλλʼ οἶοι σύ τʼ ἐγώ τε καὶ ἀμφίπολος μία μούνη, Ἀκτορίς, ἥν μοι δῶκε πατὴρ ἔτι δεῦρο κιούσῃ, ἣ νῶϊν εἴρυτο θύρας πυκινοῦ θαλάμοιο,
had come to her in the twentieth year to his native land. Nay come, nurse, strew me a couch, that all alone I may lay me down, for verily the heart in her breast is of iron.” Then wise Penelope answered him: “Strange sir, I am neither in any wise proud, nor do I scorn thee,	πείθεις δή μευ θυμόν, ἀπηνέα περ μάλʼ ἐόντα. ὣς φάτο, τῷ δʼ ἔτι μᾶλλον ὑφʼ ἵμερον ὦρσε γόοιο· κλαῖε δʼ ἔχων ἄλοχον θυμαρέα, κεδνὰ ἰδυῖαν. ὡς δʼ ὅτʼ ἂν ἀσπάσιος γῆ νηχομένοισι φανήῃ, ὧν τε Ποσειδάων εὐεργέα νῆʼ ἐνὶ πόντῳ
nor yet am I too greatly amazed, but right well do I know what manner of man thou wast, when thou wentest forth from Ithaca on thy long-oared ship. Yet come, Eurycleia, strew for him the stout bedstead outside the well-built bridal chamber which he made himself. Thither do ye bring for him the stout bedstead, and cast upon it bedding,	ῥαίσῃ, ἐπειγομένην ἀνέμῳ καὶ κύματι πηγῷ· παῦροι δʼ ἐξέφυγον πολιῆς ἁλὸς ἤπειρόνδε νηχόμενοι, πολλὴ δὲ περὶ χροῒ τέτροφεν ἅλμη, ἀσπάσιοι δʼ ἐπέβαν γαίης, κακότητα φυγόντες· ὣς ἄρα τῇ ἀσπαστὸς ἔην πόσις εἰσοροώσῃ,
fleeces and cloaks and bright coverlets.” So she spoke, and made trial of her husband. But Odysseus, in a burst of anger, spoke to his true-hearted wife, and said: “Woman, truly this is a bitter word that thou hast spoken. Who has set my bed elsewhere? Hard would it be for one,	δειρῆς δʼ οὔ πω πάμπαν ἀφίετο πήχεε λευκώ. καί νύ κʼ ὀδυρομένοισι φάνη ῥοδοδάκτυλος Ἠώς, εἰ μὴ ἄρʼ ἄλλʼ ἐνόησε θεὰ γλαυκῶπις Ἀθήνη. νύκτα μὲν ἐν περάτῃ δολιχὴν σχέθεν, Ἠῶ δʼ αὖτε ῥύσατʼ ἐπʼ Ὠκεανῷ χρυσόθρονον, οὐδʼ ἔα ἵππους
 though never so skilled, unless a god himself should come and easily by his will set it in another place. But of men there is no mortal that lives, be he never so young and strong, who could easily pry it from its place, for a great token is wrought in the fashioned bed, and it was I that built it and none other.	ζεύγνυσθʼ ὠκύποδας, φάος ἀνθρώποισι φέροντας, Λάμπον καὶ Φαέθονθʼ, οἵ τʼ Ἠῶ πῶλοι ἄγουσι. καὶ τότʼ ἄρʼ ἣν ἄλοχον προσέφη πολύμητις Ὀδυσσεύς ὦ γύναι, οὐ γάρ πω πάντων ἐπὶ πείρατʼ ἀέθλων ἤλθομεν, ἀλλʼ ἔτʼ ὄπισθεν ἀμέτρητος πόνος ἔσται,
 A bush of long-leafed olive was growing within the court, strong and vigorous, and girth it was like a pillar. Round about this I built my chamber, till I had finished it, with close-set stones, and I roofed it over well, and added to it jointed doors, close-fitting.	πολλὸς καὶ χαλεπός, τὸν ἐμὲ χρὴ πάντα τελέσσαι. ὣς γάρ μοι ψυχὴ μαντεύσατο Τειρεσίαο ἤματι τῷ ὅτε δὴ κατέβην δόμον Ἄϊδος εἴσω, νόστον ἑταίροισιν διζήμενος ἠδʼ ἐμοὶ αὐτῷ. ἀλλʼ ἔρχευ, λέκτρονδʼ ἴομεν, γύναι, ὄφρα καὶ ἤδη
 Thereafter I cut away the leafy branches of the long-leafed olive, and, trimming the trunk from the root, I smoothed it around with the adze well and cunningly, and made it straight to the line, thus fashioning the bed-post; and I bored it all with the augur. Beginning with this I hewed out my bed, till I had finished it,	ὕπνῳ ὕπο γλυκερῷ ταρπώμεθα κοιμηθέντε. τὸν δʼ αὖτε προσέειπε περίφρων Πηνελόπεια· εὐνὴ μὲν δή σοί γε τότʼ ἔσσεται ὁππότε θυμῷ σῷ ἐθέλῃς, ἐπεὶ ἄρ σε θεοὶ ποίησαν ἱκέσθαι οἶκον ἐϋκτίμενον καὶ σὴν ἐς πατρίδα γαῖαν·
inlaying it with gold and silver and ivory, and I stretched on it a thong of ox-hide, bright with purple. Thus do I declare to thee this token; but I know not, woman, whether my bedstead is still fast in its place, or whether by now some man has cut from beneath the olive stump, and set the bedstead elsewhere.”	ἀλλʼ ἐπεὶ ἐφράσθης καί τοι θεὸς ἔμβαλε θυμῷ, εἴπʼ ἄγε μοι τὸν ἄεθλον, ἐπεὶ καὶ ὄπισθεν, ὀΐω, πεύσομαι, αὐτίκα δʼ ἐστὶ δαήμεναι οὔ τι χέρειον. τὴν δʼ ἀπαμειβόμενος προσέφη πολύμητις Ὀδυσσεύς· δαιμονίη, τί τʼ ἄρʼ αὖ με μάλʼ ὀτρύνουσα κελεύεις
So he spoke, and her knees were loosened where she sat, and her heart melted, as she knew the sure tokens which Odysseus told her. Then with a burst of tears she ran straight toward him, and flung her arms about the neck of Odysseus, and kissed his head, and spoke, saying: “Be not vexed with me, Odysseus, for in all else	εἰπέμεν; αὐτὰρ ἐγὼ μυθήσομαι οὐδʼ ἐπικεύσω. οὐ μέν τοι θυμὸς κεχαρήσεται· οὐδὲ γὰρ αὐτὸς χαίρω, ἐπεὶ μάλα πολλὰ βροτῶν ἐπὶ ἄστεʼ ἄνωγεν ἐλθεῖν, ἐν χείρεσσιν ἔχοντʼ εὐῆρες ἐρετμόν, εἰς ὅ κε τοὺς ἀφίκωμαι οἳ οὐκ ἴσασι θάλασσαν
 thou wast ever the wisest of men. It is the gods that gave us sorrow, the gods who begrudged that we two should remain with each other and enjoy our youth, and come to the threshold of old age. But be not now wroth with me for this, nor full of indignation, because at the first, when I saw thee, I did not thus give thee welcome.	ἀνέρες, οὐδέ θʼ ἅλεσσι μεμιγμένον εἶδαρ ἔδουσιν· οὐδʼ ἄρα τοί γʼ ἴσασι νέας φοινικοπαρῄους, οὐδʼ εὐήρεʼ ἐρετμά, τά τε πτερὰ νηυσὶ πέλονται. σῆμα δέ μοι τόδʼ ἔειπεν ἀριφραδές, οὐδέ σε κεύσω· ὁππότε κεν δή μοι ξυμβλήμενος ἄλλος ὁδίτης
 For always the heart in my breast was full of dread, lest some man should come and beguile me with his words; for there are many that plan devices of evil. Nay, even Argive Helen, daughter of Zeus, would not have lain in love with a man of another folk,	φήῃ ἀθηρηλοιγὸν ἔχειν ἀνὰ φαιδίμῳ ὤμῳ, καὶ τότε μʼ ἐν γαίῃ πήξαντʼ ἐκέλευεν ἐρετμόν, ἔρξανθʼ ἱερὰ καλὰ Ποσειδάωνι ἄνακτι, ἀρνειὸν ταῦρόν τε συῶν τʼ ἐπιβήτορα κάπρον, οἴκαδʼ ἀποστείχειν, ἔρδειν θʼ ἱερὰς ἑκατόμβας
 had she known that the warlike sons of the Achaeans were to bring her home again to her dear native land. Yet verily in her case a god prompted her to work a shameful deed; nor until then did she lay up in her mind the thought of that folly, the grievous folly from which at the first sorrow came upon us too.	ἀθανάτοισι θεοῖσι, τοὶ οὐρανὸν εὐρὺν ἔχουσι, πᾶσι μάλʼ ἑξείης· θάνατος δέ μοι ἐξ ἁλὸς αὐτῷ ἀβληχρὸς μάλα τοῖος ἐλεύσεται, ὅς κέ με πέφνῃ γήρα’ ὕπο λιπαρῷ ἀρημένον· ἀμφὶ δὲ λαοὶ ὄλβιοι ἔσσονται· τὰ δέ μοι φάτο πάντα τελεῖσθαι.
 But now, since thou hast told the clear tokens of our bed, which no mortal beside has ever seen save thee and me alone and one single handmaid, the daughter of Actor, whom my father gave me or ever I came hither, even her who kept the doors of our strong bridal chamber,	τὸν δʼ αὖτε προσέειπε περίφρων Πηνελόπεια· εἰ μὲν δὴ γῆράς γε θεοὶ τελέουσιν ἄρειον, ἐλπωρή τοι ἔπειτα κακῶν ὑπάλυξιν ἔσεσθαι. ὣς οἱ μὲν τοιαῦτα πρὸς ἀλλήλους ἀγόρευον· τόφρα δʼ ἄρʼ Εὐρυνόμη τε ἰδὲ τροφὸς ἔντυον εὐνὴν
lo, thou dost convince my heart, unbending as it is.” So she spoke, and in his heart aroused yet more the desire for lamentation; and he wept, holding in his arms his dear and true-hearted wife. And welcome as is the sight of land to men that swim, whose well-built ship Poseidon	ἐσθῆτος μαλακῆς, δαΐδων ὕπο λαμπομενάων. αὐτὰρ ἐπεὶ στόρεσαν πυκινὸν λέχος ἐγκονέουσαι, γρηῢς μὲν κείουσα πάλιν οἶκόνδε βεβήκει, τοῖσιν δʼ Εὐρυνόμη θαλαμηπόλος ἡγεμόνευεν ἐρχομένοισι λέχοσδε, δάος μετὰ χερσὶν ἔχουσα·
 has smitten on the sea as it was driven on by the wind and the swollen wave, and but few have made their escape from the gray sea to the shore by swimming, and thickly are their bodies crusted with brine, and gladly have they set foot on the land and escaped from their evil case; even so welcome to her was her husband, as she gazed upon him,	ἐς θάλαμον δʼ ἀγαγοῦσα πάλιν κίεν. οἱ μὲν ἔπειτα ἀσπάσιοι λέκτροιο παλαιοῦ θεσμὸν ἵκοντο· αὐτὰρ Τηλέμαχος καὶ βουκόλος ἠδὲ συβώτης παῦσαν ἄρʼ ὀρχηθμοῖο πόδας, παῦσαν δὲ γυναῖκας, αὐτοὶ δʼ εὐνάζοντο κατὰ μέγαρα σκιόεντα.
 and from his neck she could in no wise let her white arms go. And now would the rosy-fingered Dawn have arisen upon their weeping, had not the goddess, flashing-eyed Athena, taken other counsel. The long night she held back at the end of its course, and likewise stayed the golden-throned Dawn at the streams of Oceanus, and would not suffer her	τὼ δʼ ἐπεὶ οὖν φιλότητος ἐταρπήτην ἐρατεινῆς, τερπέσθην μύθοισι, πρὸς ἀλλήλους ἐνέποντε, ἡ μὲν ὅσʼ ἐν μεγάροισιν ἀνέσχετο δῖα γυναικῶν, ἀνδρῶν μνηστήρων ἐσορῶσʼ ἀΐδηλον ὅμιλον, οἳ ἕθεν εἵνεκα πολλά, βόας καὶ ἴφια μῆλα,
to yoke her swift-footed horses that bring light to men, Lampus and Phaethon, who are the colts that bear the Dawn. Then to his wife said Odysseus of many wiles: “Wife, we have not yet come to the end of all our trials, but still hereafter there is to be measureless toil,	ἔσφαζον, πολλὸς δὲ πίθων ἠφύσσετο οἶνος· αὐτὰρ ὁ διογενὴς Ὀδυσεὺς ὅσα κήδεʼ ἔθηκεν ἀνθρώποις ὅσα τʼ αὐτὸς ὀϊζύσας ἐμόγησε, πάντʼ ἔλεγʼ· ἡ δʼ ἄρʼ ἐτέρπετʼ ἀκούουσʼ, οὐδέ οἱ ὕπνος πῖπτεν ἐπὶ βλεφάροισι πάρος καταλέξαι ἅπαντα.
lulled now by sweet slumber we may take our joy of rest.” Then wise Penelope answered him: “Thy bed shall be ready for thee whensoever thy heart shall desire it, since the gods have indeed caused thee to come back to thy well-built house and thy native land.	ἤρξατο δʼ ὡς πρῶτον Κίκονας δάμασʼ, αὐτὰρ ἔπειτα ἦλθʼ ἐς Λωτοφάγων ἀνδρῶν πίειραν ἄρουραν· ἠδʼ ὅσα Κύκλωψ ἔρξε, καὶ ὡς ἀπετίσατο ποινὴν ἰφθίμων ἑτάρων, οὓς ἤσθιεν οὐδʼ ἐλέαιρεν· ἠδʼ ὡς Αἴολον ἵκεθʼ, ὅ μιν πρόφρων ὑπέδεκτο
But since thou hast bethought thee of this, and a god has put it into thy heart, come, tell me of this trial, for in time to come, methinks, I shall learn of it, and to know it at once is no whit worse.” And Odysseus of many wiles answered her, and said: “Strange lady! why dost thou now so urgently bid me	καὶ πέμπʼ, οὐδέ πω αἶσα φίλην ἐς πατρίδʼ ἱκέσθαι ἤην, ἀλλά μιν αὖτις ἀναρπάξασα θύελλα πόντον ἐπʼ ἰχθυόεντα φέρεν βαρέα στενάχοντα· ἠδʼ ὡς Τηλέπυλον Λαιστρυγονίην ἀφίκανεν, οἳ νῆάς τʼ ὄλεσαν καὶ ἐϋκνήμιδας ἑταίρους
 tell thee? Yet I will declare it, and will hide nothing. Verily thy heart shall have no joy of it, even as I myself have none; for Teiresias bade me go forth to full many cities of men, bearing a shapely oar in my hands, till I should come	πάντας· Ὀδυσσεὺς δʼ οἶος ὑπέκφυγε νηῒ μελαίνῃ· καὶ Κίρκης κατέλεξε δόλον πολυμηχανίην τε, ἠδʼ ὡς εἰς Ἀΐδεω δόμον ἤλυθεν εὐρώεντα, ψυχῇ χρησόμενος Θηβαίου Τειρεσίαο, νηῒ πολυκλήϊδι, καὶ εἴσιδε πάντας ἑταίρους
 to men that know naught of the sea, and eat not of food mingled with salt; aye, and they know naught of ships with purple cheeks, or of shapely oars that serve as wings to ships. And he told me this sign, right manifest; nor will I hide it from thee. When another wayfarer, on meeting me,	μητέρα θʼ, ἥ μιν ἔτικτε καὶ ἔτρεφε τυτθὸν ἐόντα· ἠδʼ ὡς Σειρήνων ἁδινάων φθόγγον ἄκουσεν, ὥς θʼ ἵκετο Πλαγκτὰς πέτρας δεινήν τε Χάρυβδιν Σκύλλην θʼ, ἣν οὔ πώ ποτʼ ἀκήριοι ἄνδρες ἄλυξαν· ἠδʼ ὡς Ἠελίοιο βόας κατέπεφνον ἑταῖροι·
 should say that I had a winnowing fan on my stout shoulder, then he bade me fix my oar in the earth, and make goodly offerings to lord Poseidon—a ram and a bull and a boar, that mates with sows—and depart for my home, and offer sacred hecatombs	ἠδʼ ὡς νῆα θοὴν ἔβαλε ψολόεντι κεραυνῷ Ζεὺς ὑψιβρεμέτης, ἀπὸ δʼ ἔφθιθεν ἐσθλοὶ ἑταῖροι πάντες ὁμῶς, αὐτὸς δὲ κακὰς ὑπὸ κῆρας ἄλυξεν· ὥς θʼ ἵκετʼ Ὠγυγίην νῆσον νύμφην τε Καλυψώ, ἣ δή μιν κατέρυκε, λιλαιομένη πόσιν εἶναι,
to the immortal gods, who hold broad heaven, to each one in due order. And death shall come to me myself far from the sea, a death so gentle, that shall lay me low, when I am overcome with sleek old age, and my people shall dwell in prosperity around me. All this, he said, should I see fulfilled.”	ἐν σπέσσι γλαφυροῖσι, καὶ ἔτρεφεν ἠδὲ ἔφασκε θήσειν ἀθάνατον καὶ ἀγήραον ἤματα πάντα· ἀλλὰ τοῦ οὔ ποτε θυμὸν ἐνὶ στήθεσσιν ἔπειθεν· ἠδʼ ὡς ἐς Φαίηκας ἀφίκετο πολλὰ μογήσας, οἳ δή μιν περὶ κῆρι θεὸν ὣς τιμήσαντο
Then wise Penelope answered him: “If verily the gods are to bring about for thee a happier old age, there is hope then that thou wilt find an escape from evil.” Thus they spoke to one another; and meanwhile Eurynome and the nurse made ready the bed	καὶ πέμψαν σὺν νηῒ φίλην ἐς πατρίδα γαῖαν, χαλκόν τε χρυσόν τε ἅλις ἐσθῆτά τε δόντες. τοῦτʼ ἄρα δεύτατον εἶπεν ἔπος, ὅτε οἱ γλυκὺς ὕπνος λυσιμελὴς ἐπόρουσε, λύων μελεδήματα θυμοῦ. ἡ δʼ αὖτʼ ἄλλʼ ἐνόησε θεὰ γλαυκῶπις Ἀθήνη·
 of soft coverlets by the light of blazing torches. But when they had busily spread the stout-built bedstead, the old nurse went back to her chamber to lie down, and Eurynome, the maiden of the bedchamber, led them on their way to the couch with a torch in her hands;	ὁππότε δή ῥʼ Ὀδυσῆα ἐέλπετο ὃν κατὰ θυμὸν εὐνῆς ἧς ἀλόχου ταρπήμεναι ἠδὲ καὶ ὕπνου, αὐτίκʼ ἀπʼ Ὠκεανοῦ χρυσόθρονον ἠριγένειαν ὦρσεν, ἵνʼ ἀνθρώποισι φόως φέροι· ὦρτο δʼ Ὀδυσσεὺς εὐνῆς ἐκ μαλακῆς, ἀλόχῳ δʼ ἐπὶ μῦθον ἔτελλεν·
and when she had led them to the bridal chamber, she went back. And they then gladly came to the place of the couch that was theirs of old. But Telemachus and the neatherd and the swineherd stayed their feet from dancing, and stayed the women, and themselves lay down to sleep throughout the shadowy halls.	ὦ γύναι, ἤδη μὲν πολέων κεκορήμεθʼ ἀέθλων ἀμφοτέρω, σὺ μὲν ἐνθάδʼ ἐμὸν πολυκηδέα νόστον κλαίουσʼ. αὐτὰρ ἐμὲ Ζεὺς ἄλγεσι καὶ θεοὶ ἄλλοι ἱέμενον πεδάασκον ἐμῆς ἀπὸ πατρίδος αἴης· νῦν δʼ ἐπεὶ ἀμφοτέρω πολυήρατον ἱκόμεθʼ εὐνήν,
 But when the two had had their fill of the joy of love, they took delight in tales, speaking each to the other. She, the fair lady, told of all that she had endured in the halls, looking upon the destructive throng of the wooers, who for her sake	κτήματα μὲν τά μοι ἔστι, κομιζέμεν ἐν μεγάροισι, μῆλα δʼ ἅ μοι μνηστῆρες ὑπερφίαλοι κατέκειραν, πολλὰ μὲν αὐτὸς ἐγὼ ληΐσσομαι, ἄλλα δʼ Ἀχαιοὶ δώσουσʼ, εἰς ὅ κε πάντας ἐνιπλήσωσιν ἐπαύλους. ἀλλʼ ἦ τοι μὲν ἐγὼ πολυδένδρεον ἀγρὸν ἔπειμι,
slew many beasts, cattle and goodly sheep; and great store of wine was drawn from the jars. But Zeus-born Odysseus recounted all the woes that he had brought on men, and all the toil that in his sorrow he had himself endured, and she was glad to listen, nor did sweet sleep fall upon her eyelids, till he had told all the tale.	ὀψόμενος πατέρʼ ἐσθλόν, ὅ μοι πυκινῶς ἀκάχηται· σοὶ δέ, γύναι, τάδʼ ἐπιτέλλω, πινυτῇ περ ἐούσῃ· αὐτίκα γὰρ φάτις εἶσιν ἅμʼ ἠελίῳ ἀνιόντι ἀνδρῶν μνηστήρων, οὓς ἔκτανον ἐν μεγάροισιν· εἰς ὑπερῷʼ ἀναβᾶσα σὺν ἀμφιπόλοισι γυναιξὶν
He began by telling how at the first he overcame the Cicones, and then came to the rich land of the Lotus-eaters, and all that the Cyclops wrought, and how he made him pay the price for his mighty comrades, whom the Cyclops had eaten, and had shown no pity. Then how he came to Aeolus, who received him with a ready heart,	ἧσθαι, μηδέ τινα προτιόσσεο μηδʼ ἐρέεινε. ἦ ῥα καὶ ἀμφʼ ὤμοισιν ἐδύσετο τεύχεα καλά, ὦρσε δὲ Τηλέμαχον καὶ βουκόλον ἠδὲ συβώτην, πάντας δʼ ἔντεʼ ἄνωγεν ἀρήϊα χερσὶν ἑλέσθαι. οἱ δέ οἱ οὐκ ἀπίθησαν, ἐθωρήσσοντο δὲ χαλκῷ,
 and sent him on his way; but it was not yet his fate to come to his dear native land, nay, the storm-wind caught him up again, and bore him over the teeming deep, groaning heavily. Next how he came to Telepylus of the Laestrygonians, who destroyed his ships and his well-greaved comrades	ὤϊξαν δὲ θύρας, ἐκ δʼ ἤϊον· ἦρχε δʼ Ὀδυσσεύς. ἤδη μὲν φάος ἦεν ἐπὶ χθόνα, τοὺς δʼ ἄρʼ Ἀθήνη νυκτὶ κατακρύψασα θοῶς ἐξῆγε πόληος.
 and the mother who bore him and nursed him, when a child. And how he heard the voice of the Sirens, who sing unceasingly, and had come to the Wandering Rocks, and to dread Charybdis, and to Scylla, from whom never yet had men escaped unscathed. Then how his comrades slew the kine of Helios,	Ἑρμῆς δὲ ψυχὰς Κυλλήνιος ἐξεκαλεῖτο ἀνδρῶν μνηστήρων· ἔχε δὲ ῥάβδον μετὰ χερσὶν καλὴν χρυσείην, τῇ τʼ ἀνδρῶν ὄμματα θέλγει ὧν ἐθέλει, τοὺς δʼ αὖτε καὶ ὑπνώοντας ἐγείρει·
 and how Zeus, who thunders on high, smote his swift ship with a flaming thunderbolt, and his goodly comrades perished all together, while he alone escaped the evil fates. And how he came to the isle Ogygia and to the nymph Calypso, who kept him there	τῇ ῥʼ ἄγε κινήσας, ταὶ δὲ τρίζουσαι ἕποντο. ὡς δʼ ὅτε νυκτερίδες μυχῷ ἄντρου θεσπεσίοιο τρίζουσαι ποτέονται, ἐπεί κέ τις ἀποπέσῃσιν ὁρμαθοῦ ἐκ πέτρης, ἀνά τʼ ἀλλήλῃσιν ἔχονται, ὣς αἱ τετριγυῖαι ἅμʼ ἤϊσαν· ἦρχε δʼ ἄρα σφιν
 in her hollow caves, yearning that he should be her husband, and tended him, and said that she would make him immortal and ageless all his days; yet she could never persuade the heart in his breast. Then how he came after many toils to the Phaeacians, who heartily showed him all honor, as if he were a god,	Ἑρμείας ἀκάκητα κατʼ εὐρώεντα κέλευθα. πὰρ δʼ ἴσαν Ὠκεανοῦ τε ῥοὰς καὶ Λευκάδα πέτρην, ἠδὲ παρʼ Ἠελίοιο πύλας καὶ δῆμον ὀνείρων ἤϊσαν· αἶψα δʼ ἵκοντο κατʼ ἀσφοδελὸν λειμῶνα, ἔνθα τε ναίουσι ψυχαί, εἴδωλα καμόντων.
and sent him in a ship to his dear native land, after giving him stores of bronze and gold and raiment. This was the end of the tale he told, when sweet sleep, that loosens the limbs of men, leapt upon him, loosening the cares of his heart. Then again the goddess, flashing-eyed Athena, took other counsel.	εὗρον δὲ ψυχὴν Πηληϊάδεω Ἀχιλῆος καὶ Πατροκλῆος καὶ ἀμύμονος Ἀντιλόχοιο Αἴαντός θʼ, ὃς ἄριστος ἔην εἶδός τε δέμας τε τῶν ἄλλων Δαναῶν μετʼ ἀμύμονα Πηλεΐδαο ὣς οἱ μὲν περὶ κεῖνον ὁμίλεον· ἀγχίμολον δὲ
When she judged that the heart of Odysseus had had its fill of dalliance with his wife and of sleep, straightway she roused from Oceanus golden-throned Dawn to bring light to men; and Odysseus rose from his soft couch, and gave charge to his wife, saying:	ἤλυθʼ ἔπι ψυχὴ Ἀγαμέμνονος Ἀτρεΐδαο ἀχνυμένη· περὶ δʼ ἄλλαι ἀγηγέραθʼ, ὅσσαι ἅμʼ αὐτῷ οἴκῳ ἐν Αἰγίσθοιο θάνον καὶ πότμον ἐπέσπον. τὸν προτέρη ψυχὴ προσεφώνεε Πηλεΐωνος· Ἀτρεΐδη, περὶ μέν σʼ ἔφαμεν Διὶ τερπικεραύνῳ
 “Wife, by now have we had our fill of many trials, thou and I, thou here, mourning over my troublous journey home, while as for me, Zeus and the other gods bound me fast in sorrows far from my native land, all eager as I was to return. But now that we have both come to the couch of our desire,	ἀνδρῶν ἡρώων φίλον ἔμμεναι ἤματα πάντα, οὕνεκα πολλοῖσίν τε καὶ ἰφθίμοισιν ἄνασσες δήμῳ ἔνι Τρώων, ὅθι πάσχομεν ἄλγεʼ Ἀχαιοί. ἦ τʼ ἄρα καὶ σοὶ πρῶϊ παραστήσεσθαι ἔμελλεν μοῖρʼ ὀλοή, τὴν οὔ τις ἀλεύεται ὅς κε γένηται.
 do thou care for the wealth that I have within the halls; as for the flocks which the insolent wooers have wasted, I shall myself get me many as booty, and others will the Achaeans give, until they fill all my folds; but I verily will go to my well-wooded farm	ὡς ὄφελες τιμῆς ἀπονήμενος, ἧς περ ἄνασσες, δήμῳ ἔνι Τρώων θάνατον καὶ πότμον ἐπισπεῖν· τῷ κέν τοι τύμβον μὲν ἐποίησαν Παναχαιοί, ἠδέ κε καὶ σῷ παιδὶ μέγα κλέος ἤραʼ ὀπίσσω· νῦν δʼ ἄρα σʼ οἰκτίστῳ θανάτῳ εἵμαρτο ἁλῶναι.
and abide there. Look thou on no man, nor ask a question.” He spoke, and girt about his shoulders his beautiful armour, and roused Telemachus and the neatherd and the swineherd, and bade them all take weapons of war in their hands. They did not disobey, but clad themselves in bronze,	τὸν δʼ αὖτε ψυχὴ προσεφώνεεν Ἀτρείδαο· ὄλβιε Πηλέος υἱέ, θεοῖς ἐπιείκελʼ Ἀχιλλεῦ, ὃς θάνες ἐν Τροίῃ ἑκὰς Ἄργεος· ἀμφὶ δέ σʼ ἄλλοι κτείνοντο Τρώων καὶ Ἀχαιῶν υἷες ἄριστοι, μαρνάμενοι περὶ σεῖο· σὺ δʼ ἐν στροφάλιγγι κονίης
 and opened the doors, and went forth, and Odysseus led the way. By now there was light over the earth, but Athena hid them in night, and swiftly led them forth from the city.	κεῖσο μέγας μεγαλωστί, λελασμένος ἱπποσυνάων. ἡμεῖς δὲ πρόπαν ἦμαρ ἐμαρνάμεθʼ· οὐδέ κε πάμπαν παυσάμεθα πτολέμου, εἰ μὴ Ζεὺς λαίλαπι παῦσεν. αὐτὰρ ἐπεί σʼ ἐπὶ νῆας ἐνείκαμεν ἐκ πολέμοιο, κάτθεμεν ἐν λεχέεσσι, καθήραντες χρόα καλὸν
 Meanwhile Cyllenian Hermes called forth the spirits of the wooers. He held in his hands his wand, a fair wand of gold, wherewith he lulls to sleep the eyes of whom he will, while others again he wakens even out of slumber;	καί νύ κʼ ἀναΐξαντες ἔβαν κοίλας ἐπὶ νῆας, εἰ μὴ ἀνὴρ κατέρυκε παλαιά τε πολλά τε εἰδώς, Νέστωρ, οὗ καὶ πρόσθεν ἀρίστη φαίνετο βουλή· ὅ σφιν ἐϋφρονέων ἀγορήσατο καὶ μετέειπεν· ἴσχεσθʼ, Ἀργεῖοι, μὴ φεύγετε, κοῦροι Ἀχαιῶν·
with this he roused and led the spirits, and they followed gibbering. And as in the innermost recess of a wondrous cave bats flit about gibbering, when one has fallen from off the rock from the chain in which they cling to one another, so these went with him gibbering, and	μήτηρ ἐξ ἁλὸς ἥδε σὺν ἀθανάτῃς ἁλίῃσιν ἔρχεται, οὗ παιδὸς τεθνηότος ἀντιόωσα. ὣς ἔφαθʼ, οἱ δʼ ἔσχοντο φόβου μεγάθυμοι Ἀχαιοί· ἀμφὶ δέ σʼ ἔστησαν κοῦραι ἁλίοιο γέροντος οἴκτρʼ ὀλοφυρόμεναι, περὶ δʼ ἄμβροτα εἵματα ἕσσαν.
Hermes, the Helper, led them down the dank ways. Past the streams of Oceanus they went, past the rock Leucas , past the gates of the sun and the land of dreams, and quickly came to the mead of asphodel, where the spirits dwell, phantoms of men who have done with toils.	Μοῦσαι δʼ ἐννέα πᾶσαι ἀμειβόμεναι ὀπὶ καλῇ θρήνεον· ἔνθα κεν οὔ τινʼ ἀδάκρυτόν γʼ ἐνόησας Ἀργείων· τοῖον γὰρ ὑπώρορε Μοῦσα λίγεια. ἑπτὰ δὲ καὶ δέκα μέν σε ὁμῶς νύκτας τε καὶ ἦμαρ κλαίομεν ἀθάνατοί τε θεοὶ θνητοί τʼ ἄνθρωποι·
Here they found the spirit of Achilles, son of Peleus, and those of Patroclus, of peerless Antilochus, and of Aias, who in comeliness and form was the goodliest of all the Danaans after the peerless son of Peleus. So these were thronging about Achilles, and near to them	ὀκτωκαιδεκάτῃ δʼ ἔδομεν πυρί, πολλὰ δέ σʼ ἀμφὶ μῆλα κατεκτάνομεν μάλα πίονα καὶ ἕλικας βοῦς. καίεο δʼ ἔν τʼ ἐσθῆτι θεῶν καὶ ἀλείφατι πολλῷ καὶ μέλιτι γλυκερῷ· πολλοὶ δʼ ἥρωες Ἀχαιοὶ τεύχεσιν ἐρρώσαντο πυρὴν πέρι καιομένοιο,
drew the spirit of Agamemnon, son of Atreus, sorrowing; and round about him others were gathered, the spirits of all those who were slain with him in the house of Aegisthus, and met their fate. And the spirit of the son of Peleus was first to address him, saying: “Son of Atreus, we deemed that thou	πεζοί θʼ ἱππῆές τε· πολὺς δʼ ὀρυμαγδὸς ὀρώρει αὐτὰρ ἐπεὶ δή σε φλὸξ ἤνυσεν Ἡφαίστοιο, ἠῶθεν δή τοι λέγομεν λεύκʼ ὀστέʼ, Ἀχιλλεῦ, οἴνῳ ἐν ἀκρήτῳ καὶ ἀλείφατι· δῶκε δὲ μήτηρ χρύσεον ἀμφιφορῆα· Διωνύσοιο δὲ δῶρον
 above all other heroes wast all thy days dear to Zeus, who hurls the thunderbolt, because thou wast lord over many mighty men in the land of the Trojans, where we Achaeans suffered woes. But verily on thee too was deadly doom to come all too early, the doom that not one avoids of those who are born.	φάσκʼ ἔμεναι, ἔργον δὲ περικλυτοῦ Ἡφαίστοιο. ἐν τῷ τοι κεῖται λεύκʼ ὀστέα, φαίδιμʼ Ἀχιλλεῦ, μίγδα δὲ Πατρόκλοιο Μενοιτιάδαο θανόντος, χωρὶς δʼ Ἀντιλόχοιο, τὸν ἔξοχα τῖες ἁπάντων τῶν ἄλλων ἑτάρων, μετὰ Πάτροκλόν γε θανόντα.
Ah, would that in the pride of that honor of which thou wast master thou hadst met death and fate in the land of the Trojans. Then would the whole host of the Achaeans have made thee a tomb, and for thy son too wouldst thou have won great glory in days to come; but now, as it seems, it has been decreed that thou shouldst be cut off by a most piteous death.”	ἀμφʼ αὐτοῖσι δʼ ἔπειτα μέγαν καὶ ἀμύμονα τύμβον χεύαμεν Ἀργείων ἱερὸς στρατὸς αἰχμητάων ἀκτῇ ἔπι προὐχούσῃ, ἐπὶ πλατεῖ Ἑλλησπόντῳ, ὥς κεν τηλεφανὴς ἐκ ποντόφιν ἀνδράσιν εἴη τοῖς οἳ νῦν γεγάασι καὶ οἳ μετόπισθεν ἔσονται.
Then the spirit of the son of Atreus answered him: “Fortunate son of Peleus, godlike Achilles, that wast slain in the land of Troy far from Argos , and about thee others fell, the best of the sons of the Trojans and Achaeans, fighting for thy body; and thou in the whirl of dust	μήτηρ δʼ αἰτήσασα θεοὺς περικαλλέʼ ἄεθλα θῆκε μέσῳ ἐν ἀγῶνι ἀριστήεσσιν Ἀχαιῶν. ἤδη μὲν πολέων τάφῳ ἀνδρῶν ἀντεβόλησας ἡρώων, ὅτε κέν ποτʼ ἀποφθιμένου βασιλῆος ζώννυνταί τε νέοι καὶ ἐπεντύνονται ἄεθλα·
 didst lie mighty in thy mightiness, forgetful of thy horsemanship. We on our part strove the whole day long, nor should we ever have stayed from the fight, had not Zeus stayed us with a storm. But after we had borne thee to the ships from out the fight, we laid thee on a bier, and cleansed thy fair flesh	ἀλλά κε κεῖνα μάλιστα ἰδὼν θηήσαο θυμῷ, οἷʼ ἐπὶ σοὶ κατέθηκε θεὰ περικαλλέʼ ἄεθλα, ἀργυρόπεζα Θέτις· μάλα γὰρ φίλος ἦσθα θεοῖσιν. ὣς σὺ μὲν οὐδὲ θανὼν ὄνομʼ ὤλεσας, ἀλλά τοι αἰεὶ πάντας ἐπʼ ἀνθρώπους κλέος ἔσσεται ἐσθλόν, Ἀχιλλεῦ,
 with warm water and with ointment, and many hot tears did the Danaans shed around thee, and they shore their hair. And thy mother came forth from the sea with the immortal sea-nymphs, when she heard the tidings, and a wondrous cry arose over the deep, and thereat trembling laid hold of all the Achaeans.	αὐτὰρ ἐμοὶ τί τόδʼ ἦδος, ἐπεὶ πόλεμον τολύπευσα; ἐν νόστῳ γάρ μοι Ζεὺς μήσατο λυγρὸν ὄλεθρον Αἰγίσθου ὑπὸ χερσὶ καὶ οὐλομένης ἀλόχοιο. ὣς οἱ μὲν τοιαῦτα πρὸς ἀλλήλους ἀγόρευον, ἀγχίμολον δέ σφʼ ἦλθε διάκτορος ἀργεϊφόντης,
Then would they all have sprung up and rushed to the hollow ships, had not a man, wise in the wisdom of old, stayed them, even Nestor, whose counsel had before appeared the best. He with good intent addressed their assembly, and said: “‘Hold, ye Argives; flee not, Achaean youths.	ψυχὰς μνηστήρων κατάγων Ὀδυσῆϊ δαμέντων, τὼ δʼ ἄρα θαμβήσαντʼ ἰθὺς κίον, ὡς ἐσιδέσθην. ἔγνω δὲ ψυχὴ Ἀγαμέμνονος Ἀτρεΐδαο παῖδα φίλον Μελανῆος, ἀγακλυτὸν Ἀμφιμέδοντα· ξεῖνος γάρ οἱ ἔην Ἰθάκῃ ἔνι οἰκία ναίων.
'Tis his mother who comes here forth from the sea with the immortal sea-nymphs to look upon the face of her dead son.’ “So he spoke, and the great-hearted Achaeans ceased from their flight. Then around thee stood the daughters of the old man of the sea wailing piteously, and they clothed thee about with immortal raiment.	τὸν προτέρη ψυχὴ προσεφώνεεν Ἀτρεΐδαο· Ἀμφίμεδον, τί παθόντες ἐρεμνὴν γαῖαν ἔδυτε πάντες κεκριμένοι καὶ ὁμήλικες; οὐδέ κεν ἄλλως κρινάμενος λέξαιτο κατὰ πτόλιν ἄνδρας ἀρίστους. ἦ ὔμμʼ ἐν νήεσσι Ποσειδάων ἐδάμασσεν,
And the Muses, nine in all, replying to one another with sweet voices, led the dirge. There couldst thou not have seen an Argive but was in tears, so deeply did the clear-toned Muse move their hearts. Thus for seventeen days alike by night and day did we bewail thee, immortal gods and mortal men,	ὄρσας ἀργαλέους ἀνέμους καὶ κύματα μακρά; ἦ που ἀνάρσιοι ἄνδρες ἐδηλήσαντʼ ἐπὶ χέρσου βοῦς περιταμνομένους ἠδʼ οἰῶν πώεα καλά, ἠὲ περὶ πτόλιος μαχεούμενοι ἠδὲ γυναικῶν; εἰπέ μοι εἰρομένῳ· ξεῖνος δέ τοι εὔχομαι εἶναι.
 and on the eighteenth we gave thee to the fire, and many well-fatted sheep we slew around thee and sleek kine. So thou wast burned in the raiment of the gods and in abundance of unguents and sweet honey; and many Achaean warriors moved in their armour about the pyre, when thou wast burning,	ἦ οὐ μέμνῃ ὅτε κεῖσε κατήλυθον ὑμέτερον δῶ, ὀτρυνέων Ὀδυσῆα σὺν ἀντιθέῳ Μενελάῳ Ἴλιον εἰς ἅμʼ ἕπεσθαι ἐϋσσέλμων ἐπὶ νηῶν; μηνὶ δʼ ἄρʼ οὔλῳ πάντα περήσαμεν εὐρέα πόντον, σπουδῇ παρπεπιθόντες Ὀδυσσῆα πτολίπορθον.
 both footmen and charioteers, and a great din arose. But when the flame of Hephaestus had made an end of thee, in the morning we gathered thy white bones, Achilles, and laid them in unmixed wine and unguents. Thy mother had given a two-handled, golden urn, and	τὸν δʼ αὖτε ψυχὴ προσεφώνεεν Ἀμφιμέδοντος· Ἀτρεΐδη κύδιστε, ἄναξ ἀνδρῶν Ἀγάμεμνον, μέμνημαι τάδε πάντα, διοτρεφές, ὡς ἀγορεύεις· σοὶ δʼ ἐγὼ εὖ μάλα πάντα καὶ ἀτρεκέως καταλέξω, ἡμετέρου θανάτοιο κακὸν τέλος, οἷον ἐτύχθη.
 said that it was the gift of Dionysus, and the handiwork of famed Hephaestus. In this lie thy white bones, glorious Achilles, and mingled with them the bones of the dead Patroclus, son of Menoetius, but apart lie those of Antilochus, whom thou didst honor above all the rest of thy comrades after the dead Patroclus.	μνώμεθʼ Ὀδυσσῆος δὴν οἰχομένοιο δάμαρτα· ἡ δʼ οὔτʼ ἠρνεῖτο στυγερὸν γάμον οὔτʼ ἐτελεύτα, ἡμῖν φραζομένη θάνατον καὶ κῆρα μέλαιναν, ἀλλὰ δόλον τόνδʼ ἄλλον ἐνὶ φρεσὶ μερμήριξε· στησαμένη μέγαν ἱστὸν ἐνὶ μεγάροισιν ὕφαινε,
And over them we heaped up a great and goodly tomb, we the mighty host of Argive spearmen, on a projecting headland by the broad Hellespont , that it might be seen from far over the sea both by men that now are and that shall be born hereafter.	λεπτὸν καὶ περίμετρον· ἄφαρ δʼ ἡμῖν μετέειπε· κοῦροι ἐμοὶ μνηστῆρες, ἐπεὶ θάνε δῖος Ὀδυσσεύς, μίμνετʼ ἐπειγόμενοι τὸν ἐμὸν γάμον, εἰς ὅ κε φᾶρος ἐκτελέσω, μή μοι μεταμώνια νήματʼ ὄληται, Λαέρτῃ ἥρωϊ ταφήϊον, εἰς ὅτε κέν μιν
 But thy mother asked of the gods beautiful prizes, and set them in the midst of the list for the chiefs of the Achaeans. Ere now hast thou been present at the funeral games of many men that were warriors, when at the death of a king the young men gird themselves and make ready the contests,	μοῖρʼ ὀλοὴ καθέλῃσι τανηλεγέος θανάτοιο, μή τίς μοι κατὰ δῆμον Ἀχαιϊάδων νεμεσήσῃ, αἴ κεν ἄτερ σπείρου κεῖται πολλὰ κτεατίσσας. ὣς ἔφαθʼ, ἡμῖν δʼ αὖτʼ ἐπεπείθετο θυμὸς ἀγήνωρ. ἔνθα καὶ ἠματίη μὲν ὑφαίνεσκεν μέγαν ἱστόν,
but hadst thou seen that sight thou wouldst most have marvelled at heart, such beautiful prizes did the goddess, silver-footed Thetis, set there in thy honor; for very dear wast thou to the gods. Thus not even in death didst thou lose thy name, but ever shalt thou have fair renown among all men, Achilles.	νύκτας δʼ ἀλλύεσκεν, ἐπεὶ δαΐδας παραθεῖτο. ὣς τρίετες μὲν ἔληθε δόλῳ καὶ ἔπειθεν Ἀχαιούς· ἀλλʼ ὅτε τέτρατον ἦλθεν ἔτος καὶ ἐπήλυθον ὧραι, μηνῶν φθινόντων, περὶ δʼ ἤματα πόλλʼ ἐτελέσθη, καὶ τότε δή τις ἔειπε γυναικῶν, ἣ σάφα ᾔδη,
But, as for me, what pleasure have I now in this, that I wound up the skein of war? For on my return Zeus devised for me a woeful doom at the hands of Aegisthus and my accursed wife.” Thus they spoke to one another, but the messenger, Argeiphontes, drew near,	καὶ τήν γʼ ἀλλύουσαν ἐφεύρομεν ἀγλαὸν ἱστόν. ὣς τὸ μὲν ἐξετέλεσσε καὶ οὐκ ἐθέλουσʼ, ὑπʼ ἀνάγκης. εὖθʼ ἡ φᾶρος ἔδειξεν, ὑφήνασα μέγαν ἱστόν, πλύνασʼ, ἠελίῳ ἐναλίγκιον ἠὲ σελήνῃ, καὶ τότε δή ῥʼ Ὀδυσῆα κακός ποθεν ἤγαγε δαίμων
leading down the spirits of the wooers slain by Odysseus; and the two, seized with wonder, went straight toward them when they beheld them. And the spirit of Agamemnon, son of Atreus, recognized the dear son of Melaneus, glorious Amphimedon, who had been his host, dwelling in Ithaca .	ἀγροῦ ἐπʼ ἐσχατιήν, ὅθι δώματα ναῖε συβώτης. ἔνθʼ ἦλθεν φίλος υἱὸς Ὀδυσσῆος θείοιο, ἐκ Πύλου ἠμαθόεντος ἰὼν σὺν νηῒ μελαίνῃ· τὼ δὲ μνηστῆρσιν θάνατον κακὸν ἀρτύναντε ἵκοντο προτὶ ἄστυ περικλυτόν, ἦ τοι Ὀδυσσεὺς
Then the spirit of the son of Atreus spoke first to him and said “Amphimedon, what has befallen you that ye have come down beneath the dark earth, all of you picked men and of like age? One would make no other choice, were one to pick the best men in a city. Did Poseidon smite you on board your ships,	ὕστερος, αὐτὰρ Τηλέμαχος πρόσθʼ ἡγεμόνευε. τὸν δὲ συβώτης ἦγε κακὰ χροῒ εἵματʼ ἔχοντα, πτωχῷ λευγαλέῳ ἐναλίγκιον ἠδὲ γέροντι σκηπτόμενον· τὰ δὲ λυγρὰ περὶ χροῒ εἵματα ἕστο· οὐδέ τις ἡμείων δύνατο γνῶναι τὸν ἐόντα
 when he had roused cruel winds and long waves? Or did foemen work you harm on the land, while you were cutting off their cattle and fair flocks of sheep, or while they fought in defence of their city and their women? Tell me what I ask; for I declare that I am a friend of thy house.	ἐξαπίνης προφανέντʼ, οὐδʼ οἳ προγενέστεροι ἦσαν, ἀλλʼ ἔπεσίν τε κακοῖσιν ἐνίσσομεν ἠδὲ βολῇσιν. αὐτὰρ ὁ τῆος ἐτόλμα ἐνὶ μεγάροισιν ἑοῖσι βαλλόμενος καὶ ἐνισσόμενος τετληότι θυμῷ· ἀλλʼ ὅτε δή μιν ἔγειρε Διὸς νοός αἰγιόχοιο,
Dost thou not remember when I came thither to your house with godlike Menelaus to urge Odysseus to go with us to Ilios on the benched ships? A full month it took us to cross all the wide sea, for hardly could we win to our will Odysseus, the sacker of cities.”	σὺν μὲν Τηλεμάχῳ περικαλλέα τεύχεʼ ἀείρας ἐς θάλαμον κατέθηκε καὶ ἐκλήϊσεν ὀχῆας, αὐτὰρ ὁ ἣν ἄλοχον πολυκερδείῃσιν ἄνωγε τόξον μνηστήρεσσι θέμεν πολιόν τε σίδηρον, ἡμῖν αἰνομόροισιν ἀέθλια καὶ φόνου ἀρχήν.
 Then the spirit of Amphimedon answered him, and said: “Most glorious son of Atreus, king of men, Agamemnon, I remember all these things, O thou fostered of Zeus, even as thou dost tell them; and on my part I will frankly tell thee all the truth, how for us an evil end of death was wrought.	οὐδέ τις ἡμείων δύνατο κρατεροῖο βιοῖο νευρὴν ἐντανύσαι, πολλὸν δʼ ἐπιδευέες ἦμεν. ἀλλʼ ὅτε χεῖρας ἵκανεν Ὀδυσσῆος μέγα τόξον, ἔνθʼ ἡμεῖς μὲν πάντες ὁμοκλέομεν ἐπέεσσι τόξον μὴ δόμεναι, μηδʼ εἰ μάλα πολλʼ ἀγορεύοι·
 We wooed the wife of Odysseus, that had long been gone, and she neither refused the hateful marriage, nor would she ever make an end, devising for us death and black fate. Nay, she contrived in her heart this guileful thing also: she set up in her halls a great web, and fell to weaving—	Τηλέμαχος δέ μιν οἶος ἐποτρύνων ἐκέλευσεν. αὐτὰρ ὁ δέξατο χειρὶ πολύτλας δῖος Ὀδυσσεύς, ῥηϊδίως δʼ ἐτάνυσσε βιόν, διὰ δʼ ἧκε σιδήρου, στῆ δʼ ἄρʼ ἐπʼ οὐδὸν ἰών, ταχέας δʼ ἐκχεύατʼ ὀϊστοὺς δεινὸν παπταίνων, βάλε δʼ Ἀντίνοον βασιλῆα.
fine of thread was the web and very wide; and straightway she spoke among us: “‘Young men, my wooers, since goodly Odysseus is dead, be patient, though eager for my marriage, until I finish this robe—I would not that my spinning should come to naught—a shroud for the lord Laertes against the time when	αὐτὰρ ἔπειτʼ ἄλλοις ἐφίει βέλεα στονόεντα, ἄντα τιτυσκόμενος· τοὶ δʼ ἀγχιστῖνοι ἔπιπτον. γνωτὸν δʼ ἦν ὅ ῥά τίς σφι θεῶν ἐπιτάρροθος ἦεν· αὐτίκα γὰρ κατὰ δώματʼ ἐπισπόμενοι μένεϊ σφῷ κτεῖνον ἐπιστροφάδην, τῶν δὲ στόνος ὤρνυτʼ ἀεικὴς
the fell fate of grievous death shall strike him down; lest any of the Achaean women in the land should be wroth at me, if he were to lie without a shroud, who had won great possessions.’ “So she spoke, and our proud hearts consented. Then day by day she would weave at the great web,	κράτων τυπτομένων, δάπεδον δʼ ἅπαν αἵματι θῦεν. ὣς ἡμεῖς, Ἀγάμεμνον, ἀπωλόμεθʼ, ὧν ἔτι καὶ νῦν σώματʼ ἀκηδέα κεῖται ἐνὶ μεγάροις Ὀδυσῆος· οὐ γάρ πω ἴσασι φίλοι κατὰ δώμαθʼ ἑκάστου, οἵ κʼ ἀπονίψαντες μέλανα βρότον ἐξ ὠτειλέων
 but by night would unravel it, when she had let place torches by her. Thus for three years she by her craft kept the Achaeans from knowing, and beguiled them; but when the fourth year came, as the seasons rolled on, as the months waned and many days were brought in their course, even then one of her women who knew all, told us,	κατθέμενοι γοάοιεν· ὃ γὰρ γέρας ἐστὶ θανόντων. τὸν δʼ αὖτε ψυχὴ προσεφώνεεν Ἀτρεΐδαο· ὄλβιε Λαέρταο πάϊ, πολυμήχανʼ Ὀδυσσεῦ, ἦ ἄρα σὺν μεγάλῃ ἀρετῇ ἐκτήσω ἄκοιτιν. ὡς ἀγαθαὶ φρένες ἦσαν ἀμύμονι Πηνελοπείῃ,
and we caught her unravelling the splendid web. So she finished it against her will perforce. “Now when she had shewn us the robe, after weaving the great web and washing it, and it shone like the sun or the moon, then it was that some cruel god brought Odysseus from somewhere	κούρῃ Ἰκαρίου· ὡς εὖ μέμνητʼ Ὀδυσῆος, ἀνδρὸς κουριδίου· τῷ οἱ κλέος οὔ ποτʼ ὀλεῖται ἧς ἀρετῆς, τεύξουσι δʼ ἐπιχθονίοισιν ἀοιδὴν ἀθάνατοι χαρίεσσαν ἐχέφρονι Πηνελοπείῃ, οὐχ ὡς Τυνδαρέου κούρη κακὰ μήσατο ἔργα,
to the border of the land, where the swineherd dwelt. Thither too came the dear son of divine Odysseus on his return from sandy Pylos in his black ship, and these two, when they had planned an evil death for the wooers, came to the famous city, Odysseus verily	κουρίδιον κτείνασα πόσιν, στυγερὴ δέ τʼ ἀοιδὴ ἔσσετʼ ἐπʼ ἀνθρώπους, χαλεπὴν δέ τε φῆμιν ὀπάσσει θηλυτέρῃσι γυναιξί, καὶ ἥ κʼ εὐεργὸς ἔῃσιν. ὣς οἱ μὲν τοιαῦτα πρὸς ἀλλήλους ἀγόρευον, ἑσταότʼ εἰν Ἀΐδαο δόμοις, ὑπὸ κεύθεσι γαίης·
 later, but Telemachus led the way before him. Now the swineherd brought his master, clad in mean raiment, in the likeness of a woeful and aged beggar, leaning on a staff, and miserable was the raiment that he wore about his body; and not one of us could know that it was he,	οἱ δʼ ἐπεὶ ἐκ πόλιος κατέβαν, τάχα δʼ ἀγρὸν ἵκοντο καλὸν Λαέρταο τετυγμένον, ὅν ῥά ποτʼ αὐτὸς Λαέρτης κτεάτισσεν, ἐπεὶ μάλα πόλλʼ ἐμόγησεν. ἔνθα οἱ οἶκος ἔην, περὶ δὲ κλίσιον θέε πάντη, ἐν τῷ σιτέσκοντο καὶ ἵζανον ἠδὲ ἴαυον
 when he appeared so suddenly, no, not even those that were older men, but we assailed him with evil words and with missiles. Howbeit he with steadfast heart endured for a time to be pelted and taunted in his own halls; but when at last the will of Zeus, who bears the aegis, roused him,	δμῶες ἀναγκαῖοι, τοί οἱ φίλα ἐργάζοντο. ἐν δὲ γυνὴ Σικελὴ γρηῢς πέλεν, ἥ ῥα γέροντα ἐνδυκέως κομέεσκεν ἐπʼ ἀγροῦ, νόσφι πόληος. ἔνθʼ Ὀδυσεὺς δμώεσσι καὶ υἱέϊ μῦθον ἔειπεν· ὑμεῖς μὲν νῦν ἔλθετʼ ἐϋκτίμενον δόμον εἴσω,
 with the help of Telemachus he took all the beautiful arms and laid them away in the store-room and made fast the bolts. Then in his great cunning he bade his wife set before the wooers his bow and the grey iron to be a contest for us ill-fated men and the beginning of death.	δεῖπνον δʼ αἶψα συῶν ἱερεύσατε ὅς τις ἄριστος· αὐτὰρ ἐγὼ πατρὸς πειρήσομαι ἡμετέροιο, αἴ κέ μʼ ἐπιγνώῃ καὶ φράσσεται ὀφθαλμοῖσιν, ἦέ κεν ἀγνοιῇσι, πολὺν χρόνον ἀμφὶς ἐόντα. ὣς εἰπὼν δμώεσσιν ἀρήϊα τεύχεʼ ἔδωκεν.
 And no man of us was able to stretch the string of the mighty bow; nay, we fell far short of that strength. But when the great bow came to the hands of Odysseus, then we all cried out aloud not to give him the bow, how much soever he might speak;	οἱ μὲν ἔπειτα δόμονδε θοῶς κίον, αὐτὰρ Ὀδυσσεὺς ἆσσον ἴεν πολυκάρπου ἀλωῆς πειρητίζων. οὐδʼ εὗρεν Δολίον, μέγαν ὄρχατον ἐσκαταβαίνων, οὐδέ τινα δμώων οὐδʼ υἱῶν· ἀλλʼ ἄρα τοί γε αἱμασιὰς λέξοντες ἀλωῆς ἔμμεναι ἕρκος
 but Telemachus alone urged him on, and bade him take it. Then he took the bow in his hand, the much-enduring, goodly Odysseus, and with ease did he string it and send an arrow through the iron. Then he went and stood on the threshold, and poured out the swift arrows, glaring about him terribly, and smote king Antinous.	ᾤχοντʼ, αὐτὰρ ὁ τοῖσι γέρων ὁδὸν ἡγεμόνευε. τὸν δʼ οἶον πατέρʼ εὗρεν ἐϋκτιμένῃ ἐν ἀλωῇ, λιστρεύοντα φυτόν· ῥυπόωντα δὲ ἕστο χιτῶνα ῥαπτὸν ἀεικέλιον, περὶ δὲ κνήμῃσι βοείας κνημῖδας ῥαπτὰς δέδετο, γραπτῦς ἀλεείνων,
 And thereafter upon the others he with sure aim let fly his shafts, fraught with groanings, and the men fell thick and fast. Then was it known that some god was their helper; for straightway rushing on through the halls in their fury they slew men left and right, and therefrom rose hideous groaning,	χειρῖδάς τʼ ἐπὶ χερσὶ βάτων ἕνεκʼ· αὐτὰρ ὕπερθεν αἰγείην κυνέην κεφαλῇ ἔχε, πένθος ἀέξων. τὸν δʼ ὡς οὖν ἐνόησε πολύτλας δῖος Ὀδυσσεὺς γήραϊ τειρόμενον, μέγα δὲ φρεσὶ πένθος ἔχοντα, στὰς ἄρʼ ὑπὸ βλωθρὴν ὄγχνην κατὰ δάκρυον εἶβε.
 as heads were smitten, and all the floor swam with blood. Thus we perished, Agamemnon, and even now our bodies still lie uncared-for in the halls of Odysseus; for our friends in each man's home know naught as yet—our friends who might wash the black blood from our wounds	μερμήριξε δʼ ἔπειτα κατὰ φρένα καὶ κατὰ θυμὸν κύσσαι καὶ περιφῦναι ἑὸν πατέρʼ, ἠδὲ ἕκαστα εἰπεῖν, ὡς ἔλθοι καὶ ἵκοιτʼ ἐς πατρίδα γαῖαν, ἦ πρῶτʼ ἐξερέοιτο ἕκαστά τε πειρήσαιτο. ὧδε δέ οἱ φρονέοντι δοάσσατο κέρδιον εἶναι,
and lay our bodies out with wailing; for that is the due of the dead.” Then the spirit of the son of Atreus answered him: “Happy son of Laertes, Odysseus of many devices, of a truth full of all excellence was the wife thou didst win, so good of understanding was peerless Penelope,	πρῶτον κερτομίοις ἐπέεσσιν πειρηθῆναι. τὰ φρονέων ἰθὺς κίεν αὐτοῦ δῖος Ὀδυσσεύς. ἦ τοι ὁ μὲν κατέχων κεφαλὴν φυτὸν ἀμφελάχαινε· τὸν δὲ παριστάμενος προσεφώνεε φαίδιμος υἱός· ὦ γέρον, οὐκ ἀδαημονίη σʼ ἔχει ἀμφιπολεύειν
 daughter of Icarius, in that she was loyally mindful of Odysseus, her wedded husband. Therefore the fame of her virtue shall never perish, but the immortals shall make among men on earth a pleasant song in honor of constant Penelope. Not on this wise did the daughter of Tyndareus devise evil deeds	ὄρχατον, ἀλλʼ εὖ τοι κομιδὴ ἔχει, οὐδέ τι πάμπαν, οὐ φυτόν, οὐ συκέη, οὐκ ἄμπελος, οὐ μὲν ἐλαίη, οὐκ ὄγχνη, οὐ πρασιή τοι ἄνευ κομιδῆς κατὰ κῆπον. ἄλλο δέ τοι ἐρέω, σὺ δὲ μὴ χόλον ἔνθεο θυμῷ αὐτόν σʼ οὐκ ἀγαθὴ κομιδὴ ἔχει, ἀλλʼ ἅμα γῆρας
and slay her wedded husband, and hateful shall the song regarding her be among men, and evil repute doth she bring upon all womankind, even upon her that doeth uprightly.” Thus the two spoke to one another, as they stood in the house of Hades beneath the depths of the earth.	λυγρὸν ἔχεις αὐχμεῖς τε κακῶς καὶ ἀεικέα ἕσσαι. οὐ μὲν ἀεργίης γε ἄναξ ἕνεκʼ οὔ σε κομίζει, οὐδέ τί τοι δούλειον ἐπιπρέπει εἰσοράασθαι εἶδος καὶ μέγεθος· βασιλῆϊ γὰρ ἀνδρὶ ἔοικας. τοιούτῳ δὲ ἔοικας, ἐπεὶ λούσαιτο φάγοι τε,
But Odysseus and his men, when they had gone down from the city, quickly came to the fair and well-ordered farm of Laertes, which he had won for himself in days past, and much had he toiled for it. There was his house, and all about it ran the sheds in which ate, and sat, and slept	εὑδέμεναι μαλακῶς· ἡ γὰρ δίκη ἐστὶ γερόντων. ἀλλʼ ἄγε μοι τόδε εἰπὲ καὶ ἀτρεκέως κατάλεξον, τεῦ δμὼς εἶς ἀνδρῶν; τεῦ δʼ ὄρχατον ἀμφιπολεύεις; καὶ μοι τοῦτʼ ἀγόρευσον ἐτήτυμον, ὄφρʼ ἐῢ εἰδῶ, εἰ ἐτεόν γʼ Ἰθάκην τήνδʼ ἱκόμεθʼ, ὥς μοι ἔειπεν
the servants that were bondsmen, that did his pleasure; but within it was an old Sicilian woman, who tended the old man with kindly care there at the farm, far from the city. Then Odysseus spoke to the servants and to his son, saying: “Do you now go within the well-built house,	οὗτος ἀνὴρ νῦν δὴ ξυμβλήμενος ἐνθάδʼ ἰόντι, οὔ τι μάλʼ ἀρτίφρων, ἐπεὶ οὐ τόλμησεν ἕκαστα εἰπεῖν ἠδʼ ἐπακοῦσαι ἐμὸν ἔπος, ὡς ἐρέεινον ἀμφὶ ξείνῳ ἐμῷ, ἤ που ζώει τε καὶ ἔστιν ἦ ἤδη τέθνηκε καὶ εἰν Ἀΐδαο δόμοισιν.
and straightway slay for dinner the best of the swine; but I will make trial of my father, and see whether he will recognize me and know me by sight, or whether he will fail to know me, since I have been gone so long a time.” So saying, he gave to the slaves his battle-gear.	ἐκ γάρ τοι ἐρέω, σὺ δὲ σύνθεο καί μευ ἄκουσον· ἄνδρα ποτʼ ἐξείνισσα φίλῃ ἐνὶ πατρίδι γαίῃ ἡμέτερόνδʼ ἐλθόντα, καὶ οὔ πω τις βροτὸς ἄλλος ξείνων τηλεδαπῶν φιλίων ἐμὸν ἵκετο δῶμα· εὔχετο δʼ ἐξ Ἰθάκης γένος ἔμμεναι, αὐτὰρ ἔφασκε
 They thereafter went quickly to the house; but Odysseus drew near to the fruitful vineyard in his quest. Now he did not find Dolius as he went down into the great orchard, nor any of his slaves or of his sons, but as it chanced	Λαέρτην Ἀρκεισιάδην πατέρʼ ἔμμεναι αὐτῷ. τὸν μὲν ἐγὼ πρὸς δώματʼ ἄγων ἐῢ ἐξείνισσα, ἐνδυκέως φιλέων, πολλῶν κατὰ οἶκον ἐόντων, καί οἱ δῶρα πόρον ξεινήϊα, οἷα ἐῴκει. χρυσοῦ μέν οἱ δῶκʼ εὐεργέος ἑπτὰ τάλαντα,
 they had gone to gather stones for the vineyard wall, and the old man was their leader. But he found his father alone in the well-ordered vineyard, digging about a plant; and he was clothed in a foul tunic, patched and wretched, and about his shins he had bound stitched greaves of ox-hide to guard against scratches,	δῶκα δέ οἱ κρητῆρα πανάργυρον ἀνθεμόεντα, δώδεκα δʼ ἁπλοΐδας χλαίνας, τόσσους δὲ τάπητας, τόσσα δὲ φάρεα καλά, τόσους δʼ ἐπὶ τοῖσι χιτῶνας, χωρὶς δʼ αὖτε γυναῖκας, ἀμύμονα ἔργα ἰδυίας, τέσσαρας εἰδαλίμας, ἃς ἤθελεν αὐτὸς ἑλέσθαι.
and he wore gloves upon his hands because of the thorns, and on his head a goatskin cap; and he nursed his sorrow. Now when the much-enduring, goodly Odysseus saw him, worn with old age and laden with great grief at heart, he stood still beneath a tall pear tree, and shed tears.	τὸν δʼ ἠμείβετʼ ἔπειτα πατὴρ κατὰ δάκρυον εἴβων· ξεῖνʼ, ἦ τοι μὲν γαῖαν ἱκάνεις, ἣν ἐρεείνεις, ὑβρισταὶ δʼ αὐτὴν καὶ ἀτάσθαλοι ἄνδρες ἔχουσιν· δῶρα δʼ ἐτώσια ταῦτα χαρίζεο, μυρίʼ ὀπάζων· εἰ γάρ μιν ζωόν γʼ ἐκίχεις Ἰθάκης ἐνὶ δήμῳ,
 Then he debated in mind and heart whether to kiss and embrace his father, and tell him all, how he had returned and come to his native land, or whether he should first question him, and prove him in each thing. And, as he pondered, this seemed to him the better course,	τῷ κέν σʼ εὖ δώροισιν ἀμειψάμενος ἀπέπεμψε καὶ ξενίῃ ἀγαθῇ ἡ γὰρ θέμις, ὅς τις ὑπάρξῃ. ἀλλʼ ἄγε μοι τόδε εἰπὲ καὶ ἀτρεκέως κατάλεξον, πόστον δὴ ἔτος ἐστίν, ὅτε ξείνισσας ἐκεῖνον σὸν ξεῖνον δύστηνον, ἐμὸν παῖδʼ, εἴ ποτʼ ἔην γε,
to prove him first with mocking words. So with this in mind the goodly Odysseus went straight toward him. He verily was holding his head down, digging about a plant, and his glorious son came up to him, and addressed him, saying: “Old man, no lack of skill hast thou to tend	δύσμορον; ὅν που τῆλε φίλων καὶ πατρίδος αἴης ἠέ που ἐν πόντῳ φάγον ἰχθύες, ἢ ἐπὶ χέρσου θηρσὶ καὶ οἰωνοῖσιν ἕλωρ γένετʼ· οὐδέ ἑ μήτηρ κλαῦσε περιστείλασα πατήρ θʼ, οἵ μιν τεκόμεσθα· οὐδʼ ἄλοχος πολύδωρος, ἐχέφρων Πηνελόπεια,
 a garden; nay, thy care is good, and there is naught whatsoever, either plant or fig tree, or vine, nay, or olive, or pear, or garden-plot in all the field that lacks care. But another thing will I tell thee, and do thou not lay up wrath thereat in thy heart: thou thyself enjoyest no good care, but	κώκυσʼ ἐν λεχέεσσιν ἑὸν πόσιν, ὡς ἐπεῴκει, ὀφθαλμοὺς καθελοῦσα· τὸ γὰρ γέρας ἐστὶ θανόντων. καί μοι τοῦτʼ ἀγόρευσον ἐτήτυμον, ὄφρʼ ἐῢ εἰδῶ· τίς πόθεν εἶς ἀνδρῶν; πόθι τοι πόλις ἠδὲ τοκῆες; ποῦ δὲ νηῦς ἕστηκε θοή, ἥ σʼ ἤγαγε δεῦρο
 thou bearest woeful old age, and therewith art foul and unkempt, and clad in mean raiment. Surely it is not because of sloth on thy part that thy master cares not for thee, nor dost thou seem in any wise like a slave to look upon either in form or in stature; for thou art like a king, even like one who, when he has bathed and eaten,	ἀντιθέους θʼ ἑτάρους; ἦ ἔμπορος εἰλήλουθας νηὸς ἐπʼ ἀλλοτρίης, οἱ δʼ ἐκβήσαντες ἔβησαν; τὸν δʼ ἀπαμειβόμενος προσέφη πολύμητις Ὀδυσσεύς· τοιγὰρ ἐγώ τοι πάντα μάλʼ ἀτρεκέως καταλέξω. εἰμὶ μὲν ἐξ Ἀλύβαντος, ὅθι κλυτὰ δώματα ναίω,
should sleep soft; for this is the way of old men. But come, tell me this, and declare it truly. Whose slave art thou, and whose orchard dost thou tend? And tell me this also truly, that I may know full well, whether this is indeed Ithaca , to which we are now come, as	υἱὸς Ἀφείδαντος Πολυπημονίδαο ἄνακτος· αὐτὰρ ἐμοί γʼ ὄνομʼ ἐστὶν Ἐπήριτος· ἀλλά με δαίμων πλάγξʼ ἀπὸ Σικανίης δεῦρʼ ἐλθέμεν οὐκ ἐθέλοντα· νηῦς δέ μοι ἥδʼ ἕστηκεν ἐπʼ ἀγροῦ νόσφι πόληος. αὐτὰρ Ὀδυσσῆϊ τόδε δὴ πέμπτον ἔτος ἐστίν,
 a man yonder told me, who met me but now on my way hither. In no wise over sound of wit was he, for he deigned not to tell me of each thing, nor to listen to my word, when I questioned him about a friend of mine, whether haply he still lives, or is now dead and in the house of Hades.	ἐξ οὗ κεῖθεν ἔβη καὶ ἐμῆς ἀπελήλυθε πάτρης, δύσμορος· ἦ τέ οἱ ἐσθλοὶ ἔσαν ὄρνιθες ἰόντι, δεξιοί, οἷς χαίρων μὲν ἐγὼν ἀπέπεμπον ἐκεῖνον, χαῖρε δὲ κεῖνος ἰών· θυμὸς δʼ ἔτι νῶϊν ἐώλπει μίξεσθαι ξενίῃ ἠδʼ ἀγλαὰ δῶρα διδώσειν.
For I will tell thee, and do thou give heed and hearken. I once entertained in my dear native land a man that came to our house, and never did any man beside of strangers that dwell afar come to my house a more welcome guest. He declared that by lineage he came from Ithaca , and said	ὣς φάτο, τὸν δʼ ἄχεος νεφέλη ἐκάλυψε μέλαινα· ἀμφοτέρῃσι δὲ χερσὶν ἑλὼν κόνιν αἰθαλόεσσαν χεύατο κὰκ κεφαλῆς πολιῆς, ἁδινὰ στεναχίζων. τοῦ δʼ ὠρίνετο θυμός, ἀνὰ ῥῖνας δέ οἱ ἤδη δριμὺ μένος προὔτυψε φίλον πατέρʼ εἰσορόωντι.
 that his own father was Laertes, son of Arceisius. So I took him to the house and gave him entertainment with kindly welcome of the rich store that was within, and I gave him gifts of friendship, such as are meet. Of well-wrought gold	κύσσε δέ μιν περιφὺς ἐπιάλμενος, ἠδὲ προσηύδα· κεῖνος μέν τοι ὅδʼ αὐτὸς ἐγώ, πάτερ, ὃν σὺ μεταλλᾷς, ἤλυθον εἰκοστῷ ἔτεϊ ἐς πατρίδα γαῖαν. ἀλλʼ ἴσχεο κλαυθμοῖο γόοιό τε δακρυόεντος. ἐκ γάρ τοι ἐρέω· μάλα δὲ χρὴ σπευδέμεν ἔμπης·
I gave him seven talents, and a mixing-bowl all of silver, embossed with flowers, and twelve cloaks of single fold, and as many coverlets, and as many fair mantles, and as many tunics besides, and furthermore women, skilled in goodly handiwork, four comely women, whom he himself was minded to choose.”	μνηστῆρας κατέπεφνον ἐν ἡμετέροισι δόμοισι, λώβην τινύμενος θυμαλγέα καὶ κακὰ ἔργα. τὸν δʼ αὖ Λαέρτης ἀπαμείβετο φώνησέν τε· εἰ μὲν δὴ Ὀδυσεύς γε ἐμὸς πάϊς ἐνθάδʼ ἱκάνεις, σῆμά τί μοι νῦν εἰπὲ ἀριφραδές, ὄφρα πεποίθω.
Then his father answered him, weeping: “Stranger, verily thou art come to the country of which thou dost ask, but wanton and reckless men now possess it. And all in vain didst thou bestow those gifts, the countless gifts thou gavest. For if thou hadst found him yet alive in the land of Ithaca ,	τὸν δʼ ἀπαμειβόμενος προσέφη πολύμητις Ὀδυσσεύς· οὐλὴν μὲν πρῶτον τήνδε φράσαι ὀφθαλμοῖσι, τὴν ἐν Παρνησῷ μʼ ἔλασεν σῦς λευκῷ ὀδόντι οἰχόμενον· σὺ δέ με προΐεις καὶ πότνια μήτηρ ἐς πατέρʼ Αὐτόλυκον μητρὸς φίλον, ὄφρʼ ἂν ἑλοίμην
 then would he have sent thee on thy way with ample requital of gifts and good entertainment; for that is the due of him who begins the kindness But come, tell me this, and declare it truly. How many years have passed since thou didst entertain that guest, that hapless guest, my son—as sure as ever such a man there was—	δῶρα, τὰ δεῦρο μολών μοι ὑπέσχετο καὶ κατένευσεν. εἰ δʼ ἄγε τοι καὶ δένδρεʼ ἐϋκτιμένην κατʼ ἀλωὴν εἴπω, ἅ μοί ποτʼ ἔδωκας, ἐγὼ δʼ ᾔτεόν σε ἕκαστα παιδνὸς ἐών, κατὰ κῆπον ἐπισπόμενος· διὰ δʼ αὐτῶν ἱκνεύμεσθα, σὺ δʼ ὠνόμασας καὶ ἔειπες ἕκαστα.
my ill-starred son, whom far from his friends and his native land haply the fishes have devoured in the deep, or on the shore he has become the spoil of beasts and birds? Nor did his mother deck him for burial and weep over him, nor his father, we who gave him birth, no, nor did his wife, wooed with many gifts, constant Penelope,	ὄγχνας μοι δῶκας τρισκαίδεκα καὶ δέκα μηλέας, συκέας τεσσαράκοντʼ· ὄρχους δέ μοι ὧδʼ ὀνόμηνας δώσειν πεντήκοντα, διατρύγιος δὲ ἕκαστος ἤην· ἔνθα δʼ ἀνὰ σταφυλαὶ παντοῖαι ἔασιν— ὁππότε δὴ Διὸς ὧραι ἐπιβρίσειαν ὕπερθεν.
 bewail her own husband upon the bier, as was meet, when she had closed his eyes in death; though that is the due of the dead. And tell me this also truly, that I may know full well. Who art thou among men, and from whence? Where is thy city, and where thy parents? Where is the swift ship moored that brought thee hither	ὣς φάτο, τοῦ δʼ αὐτοῦ λύτο γούνατα καὶ φίλον ἦτορ, σήματʼ ἀναγνόντος τά οἱ ἔμπεδα πέφραδʼ Ὀδυσσεύς. ἀμφὶ δὲ παιδὶ φίλῳ βάλε πήχεε· τὸν δὲ ποτὶ οἷ εἷλεν ἀποψύχοντα πολύτλας δῖος Ὀδυσσεύς. αὐτὰρ ἐπεί ῥʼ ἄμπνυτο καὶ ἐς φρένα θυμὸς ἀγέρθη,
with thy godlike comrades? Or didst thou come as a passenger on another's ship, and did they depart when they had set thee on shore?” Then Odysseus of many wiles answered him, and said: “Then verily will I frankly tell thee all. I come from Alybas, where I have a glorious house,	ἐξαῦτις μύθοισιν ἀμειβόμενος προσέειπε· Ζεῦ πάτερ, ἦ ῥα ἔτʼ ἔστε θεοὶ κατὰ μακρὸν Ὄλυμπον, εἰ ἐτεὸν μνηστῆρες ἀτάσθαλον ὕβριν ἔτισαν. νῦν δʼ αἰνῶς δείδοικα κατὰ φρένα μὴ τάχα πάντες ἐνθάδʼ ἐπέλθωσιν Ἰθακήσιοι, ἀγγελίας δὲ
 and I am the son of Apheidas, son of lord Polypemon, and my own name is Eperitus. But a god drove me wandering from Sicania to come hither against my will and my ship lies yonder off the tilled land away from the city. But as for Odysseus, it is now the fifth year	πάντη ἐποτρύνωσι Κεφαλλήνων πολίεσσι. τὸν δʼ ἀπαμειβόμενος προσέφη πολύμητις Ὀδυσσεύς· θάρσει, μή τοι ταῦτα μετὰ φρεσὶ σῇσι μελόντων. ἀλλʼ ἴομεν προτὶ οἶκον, ὃς ὀρχάτου ἐγγύθι κεῖται· ἔνθα δὲ Τηλέμαχον καὶ βουκόλον ἠδὲ συβώτην
since he went thence, and departed from my country. Hapless man! Yet he had birds of good omen, when he set out, birds upon the right. So I was glad of them, as I sent him on his way, and he went gladly forth, and our hearts hoped that we should yet meet as host and guest and give one another glorious gifts.”	προὔπεμψʼ, ὡς ἂν δεῖπνον ἐφοπλίσσωσι τάχιστα. ὣς ἄρα φωνήσαντε βάτην πρὸς δώματα καλά. οἱ δʼ ὅτε δή ῥʼ ἵκοντο δόμους εὖ ναιετάοντας, εὗρον Τηλέμαχον καὶ βουκόλον ἠδὲ συβώτην ταμνομένους κρέα πολλὰ κερῶντάς τʼ αἴθοπα οἶνον.
So he spoke, and a dark cloud of grief enwrapped Laertes, and with both his hands he took the dark dust and strewed it over his grey head with ceaseless groaning. Then the heart of Odysseus was stirred, and up through his nostrils shot a keen pang, as he beheld his dear father.	τόφρα δὲ Λαέρτην μεγαλήτορα ᾧ ἐνὶ οἴκῳ ἀμφίπολος Σικελὴ λοῦσεν καὶ χρῖσεν ἐλαίῳ, ἀμφὶ δʼ ἄρα χλαῖναν καλὴν βάλεν· αὐτὰρ Ἀθήνη ἄγχι παρισταμένη μέλεʼ ἤλδανε ποιμένι λαῶν, μείζονα δʼ ἠὲ πάρος καὶ πάσσονα θῆκεν ἰδέσθαι.
And he sprang toward him, and clasped him in his arms, and kissed him, saying: “Lo, father, I here before thee, my very self, am that man of whom thou dost ask; I am come in the twentieth year to my native land. But cease from grief and tearful lamenting, for I will tell thee all, though great is the need of haste.	ἐκ δʼ ἀσαμίνθου βῆ· θαύμαζε δέ μιν φίλος υἱός, ὡς ἴδεν ἀθανάτοισι θεοῖς ἐναλίγκιον ἄντην· καί μιν φωνήσας ἔπεα πτερόεντα προσηύδα· ὦ πάτερ, ἦ μάλα τίς σε θεῶν αἰειγενετάων εἶδός τε μέγεθός τε ἀμείνονα θῆκεν ἰδέσθαι.
The wooers have I slain in our halls, and have taken vengeance on their grievous insolence and their evil deeds.” Then Laertes answered him again, and said: “If it is indeed as Odysseus, my son, that thou art come hither, tell me now some clear sign, that I maybe sure.”	τὸν δʼ αὖ Λαέρτης πεπνυμένος ἀντίον ηὔδα· αἲ γάρ, Ζεῦ τε πάτερ καὶ Ἀθηναίη καὶ Ἄπολλον, οἷος Νήρικον εἷλον, ἐϋκτίμενον πτολίεθρον, ἀκτὴν ἠπείροιο, Κεφαλλήνεσσιν ἀνάσσων, τοῖος ἐών τοι χθιζὸς ἐν ἡμετέροισι δόμοισιν,
And Odysseus of many wiles answered him and said: “This scar first do thou mark with thine eyes, the scar of the wound which a boar dealt me with his white tusk on Parnassus , when I had gone thither. It was thou that didst send me forth, thou and my honored mother, to Autolycus, my mother's father, that I might get	τεύχεʼ ἔχων ὤμοισιν, ἐφεστάμεναι καὶ ἀμύνειν ἄνδρας μνηστῆρας· τῷ κε σφέων γούνατʼ ἔλυσα πολλῶν ἐν μεγάροισι, σὺ δὲ φρένας ἔνδον ἐγήθεις. ὣς οἷ μὲν τοιαῦτα πρὸς ἀλλήλους ἀγόρευον. οἱ δʼ ἐπεὶ οὖν παύσαντο πόνου τετύκοντό τε δαῖτα,
 the gifts which, when he came hither, he promised and agreed to give me. And come, I will tell thee also the trees in the well-ordered garden which once thou gavest me, and I, who was but a child, was following thee through the garden, and asking thee for this and that. It was through these very trees that we passed, and thou didst name them, and tell me of each one.	ἑξείης ἕζοντο κατὰ κλισμούς τε θρόνους τε· ἔνθʼ οἱ μὲν δείπνῳ ἐπεχείρεον, ἀγχίμολον δὲ ἦλθʼ ὁ γέρων Δολίος, σὺν δʼ υἱεῖς τοῖο γέροντος, ἐξ ἔργων μογέοντες, ἐπεὶ προμολοῦσα κάλεσσεν μήτηρ γρηῦς Σικελή, ἥ σφεας τρέφε καί ῥα γέροντα
Pear-trees thirteen thou gavest me, and ten apple-trees, and forty fig-trees. And rows of vines too didst thou promise to give me, even as I say, fifty of them, which ripened severally at different times—and upon them are clusters of all sorts—whensoever the seasons of Zeus weighed them down from above.”	ἐνδυκέως κομέεσκεν, ἐπεὶ κατὰ γῆρας ἔμαρψεν. οἱ δʼ ὡς οὖν Ὀδυσῆα ἴδον φράσσαντό τε θυμῷ, ἔσταν ἐνὶ μεγάροισι τεθηπότες· αὐτὰρ Ὀδυσσεὺς μειλιχίοις ἐπέεσσι καθαπτόμενος προσέειπεν· ὦ γέρον, ἵζʼ ἐπὶ δεῖπνον, ἀπεκλελάθεσθε δὲ θάμβευς·
 So he spoke, and his father's knees were loosened where he stood, and his heart melted, as he knew the sure tokens which Odysseus told him. About his dear son he flung both his arms, and the much-enduring, goodly Odysseus caught him unto him fainting. But when he revived, and his spirit returned again into his breast,	δηρὸν γὰρ σίτῳ ἐπιχειρήσειν μεμαῶτες μίμνομεν ἐν μεγάροις, ὑμέας ποτιδέγμενοι αἰεί. ὣς ἄρ ἔφη, Δολίος δʼ ἰθὺς κίε χεῖρε πετάσσας ἀμφοτέρας, Ὀδυσεῦς δὲ λαβὼν κύσε χεῖρʼ ἐπὶ καρπῷ, καί μιν φωνήσας ἔπεα πτερόεντα προσηύδα·
once more he made answer, and spoke, saying: “Father Zeus, verily ye gods yet hold sway on high Olympus , if indeed the wooers have paid the price of their wanton insolence. But now I have wondrous dread at heart, lest straightway all the men of Ithaca come hither against us, and	ὦ φίλʼ, ἐπεὶ νόστησας ἐελδομένοισι μάλʼ ἡμῖν οὐδʼ ἔτʼ ὀϊομένοισι, θεοὶ δέ σʼ ἀνήγαγον αὐτοί, οὖλέ τε καὶ μάλα χαῖρε, θεοὶ δέ τοι ὄλβια δοῖεν. καί μοι τοῦτʼ ἀγόρευσον ἐτήτυμον, ὄφρʼ ἐῢ εἰδῶ, ἢ ἤδη σάφα οἶδε περίφρων Πηνελόπεια
send messengers everywhere to the cities of the Cephallenians.” Then Odysseus of many wiles answered him, and said: “Be of good cheer, and let not these things distress thy heart. But let us go to the house, which lies near the orchard, for thither	νοστήσαντά σε δεῦρʼ, ἦ ἄγγελον ὀτρύνωμεν. τὸν δʼ ἀπαμειβόμενος προσέφη πολύμητις Ὀδυσσεύς ὦ γέρον, ἤδη οἶδε· τί σε χρὴ ταῦτα πένεσθαι; ὣς φάθʼ, ὁ δʼ αὖτις ἄρʼ ἕζετʼ ἐϋξέστου ἐπὶ δίφρου. ὣς δʼ αὔτως παῖδες Δολίου κλυτὸν ἀμφʼ Ὀδυσῆα
I sent forward Telemachus and the neatherd and the swineherd, that with all speed they might prepare our meal.” So spoke the two, and went their way to the goodly house. And when they had come to the stately house, they found Telemachus, and the neatherd, and the swineherd carving flesh in abundance, and mixing the flaming wine.	δεικανόωντʼ ἐπέεσσι καὶ ἐν χείρεσσι φύοντο, ἑξείης δʼ ἕζοντο παραὶ Δολίον, πατέρα σφόν. ὣς οἱ μὲν περὶ δεῖπνον ἐνὶ μεγάροισι πένοντο· Ὄσσα δʼ ἄρʼ ἄγγελος ὦκα κατὰ πτόλιν ᾤχετο πάντη, μνηστήρων στυγερὸν θάνατον καὶ κῆρʼ ἐνέπουσα.
 Meanwhile the Sicilian handmaid bathed great-hearted Laertes in his house, and anointed him with oil, and about him cast a fair cloak. But Athena drew near, and made greater the limbs of the shepherd of the people, and made him taller than before and mightier to behold.	οἱ δʼ ἄρʼ ὁμῶς ἀΐοντες ἐφοίτων ἄλλοθεν ἄλλος μυχμῷ τε στοναχῇ τε δόμων προπάροιθʼ Ὀδυσῆος, ἐκ δὲ νέκυς οἴκων φόρεον καὶ θάπτον ἕκαστοι, τοὺς δʼ ἐξ ἀλλάων πολίων οἶκόνδε ἕκαστον πέμπον ἄγειν ἁλιεῦσι θοῇς ἐπὶ νηυσὶ τιθέντες·
Then he came forth from the bath, and his dear son marvelled at him, seeing him in presence like unto the immortal gods. And he spoke, and addressed him with winged words: “Father, surely some one of the gods that are forever has made thee goodlier to behold in comeliness and in stature.”	αὐτοὶ δʼ εἰς ἀγορὴν κίον ἀθρόοι, ἀχνύμενοι κῆρ. αὐτὰρ ἐπεί ῥʼ ἤγερθεν ὁμηγερέες τʼ ἐγένοντο, τοῖσιν δʼ Εὐπείθης ἀνά θʼ ἵστατο καὶ μετέειπε· παιδὸς γάρ οἱ ἄλαστον ἐνὶ φρεσὶ πένθος ἔκειτο, Ἀντινόου, τὸν πρῶτον ἐνήρατο δῖος Ὀδυσσεύς·
 Then wise Laertes answered him: “I would, O father Zeus, and Athena, and Apollo, that in such strength as when I took Nericus, the well built citadel on the shore of the mainland, when I was lord of the Cephallenians, even in such strength I had stood by thy side yesterday in our house	τοῦ ὅ γε δάκρυ χέων ἀγορήσατο καὶ μετέειπεν· ὦ φίλοι, ἦ μέγα ἔργον ἀνὴρ ὅδʼ ἐμήσατʼ Ἀχαιούς· τοὺς μὲν σὺν νήεσσιν ἄγων πολέας τε καὶ ἐσθλοὺς ὤλεσε μὲν νῆας γλαφυράς, ἀπὸ δʼ ὤλεσε λαούς· τοὺς δʼ ἐλθὼν ἔκτεινε Κεφαλλήνων ὄχʼ ἀρίστους,
with my armour about my shoulders, and had beaten back the wooers. So should I have loosened the knees of many of them in the halls, and thy heart would have been made glad within thee.” So they spoke to one another. But when the others had ceased from their labour, and had made ready the meal,	ἀλλʼ ἄγετε, πρὶν τοῦτον ἢ ἐς Πύλον ὦκα ἱκέσθαι ἢ καὶ ἐς Ἤλιδα δῖαν, ὅθι κρατέουσιν Ἐπειοί, ἴομεν· ἦ καὶ ἔπειτα κατηφέες ἐσσόμεθʼ αἰεί· λώβη γὰρ τάδε γʼ ἐστὶ καὶ ἐσσομένοισι πυθέσθαι, εἰ δὴ μὴ παίδων τε κασιγνήτων τε φονῆας
 they sat down in order on the chairs and high seats. Then they were about to set hands to their food, when the old man Dolius drew near, and with him the old man's sons, wearied from their work in the fields, for their mother, the old Sicilian woman, had gone forth and called them, she who	τισόμεθʼ. οὐκ ἂν ἐμοί γε μετὰ φρεσὶν ἡδὺ γένοιτο ζωέμεν, ἀλλὰ τάχιστα θανὼν φθιμένοισι μετείην. ἀλλʼ ἴομεν, μὴ φθέωσι περαιωθέντες ἐκεῖνοι. ὣς φάτο δάκρυ χέων, οἶκτος δʼ ἕλε πάντας Ἀχαιούς. ἀγχίμολον δέ σφʼ ἦλθε Μέδων καὶ θεῖος ἀοιδὸς
saw to their food, and tended the old man with kindly care, now that old age had laid hold of him. And they, when they saw Odysseus, and marked him in their minds, stood in the halls lost in wonder. But Odysseus addressed them with gentle words, and said: “Old man, sit down to dinner, and do ye wholly forget your wonder,	ἐκ μεγάρων Ὀδυσῆος, ἐπεί σφεας ὕπνος ἀνῆκεν, ἔσταν δʼ ἐν μέσσοισι· τάφος δʼ ἕλεν ἄνδρα ἕκαστον. τοῖσι δὲ καὶ μετέειπε Μέδων πεπνυμένα εἰδώς· κέκλυτε δὴ νῦν μευ, Ἰθακήσιοι· οὐ γὰρ Ὀδυσσεὺς ἀθανάτων ἀέκητι θεῶν τάδʼ ἐμήσατο ἔργα·
for long have we waited in the halls, though eager to set hands to the food, ever expecting your coming.” So he spoke, and Dolius ran straight toward him with both hands outstretched, and he clasped the hand of Odysseus and kissed it on the wrist, and spoke, and addressed him with winged words:	αὐτὸς ἐγὼν εἶδον θεὸν ἄμβροτον, ὅς ῥʼ Ὀδυσῆϊ ἐγγύθεν ἑστήκει καὶ Μέντορι πάντα ἐῴκει. ἀθάνατος δὲ θεὸς τοτὲ μὲν προπάροιθʼ Ὀδυσῆος φαίνετο θαρσύνων, τοτὲ δὲ μνηστῆρας ὀρίνων θῦνε κατὰ μέγαρον· τοὶ δʼ ἀγχιστῖνοι ἔπιπτον.
that thou hast come back hither, or shall we send her a messenger?” Then Odysseus of many wiles answered him, and said: “Old man, she knows already; why shouldst thou be busied with this?” So he spoke, and the other sat down again on the polished chair. And even in like manner the sons of Dolius gathered around glorious Odysseus	ὣς φάτο, τοὺς δʼ ἄρα πάντας ὑπὸ χλωρὸν δέος ᾕρει. τοῖσι δὲ καὶ μετέειπε γέρων ἥρως Ἁλιθέρσης Μαστορίδης· ὁ γὰρ οἶος ὅρα πρόσσω καὶ ὀπίσσω· ὅ σφιν ἐϋφρονέων ἀγορήσατο καὶ μετέειπε· κέκλυτε δὴ νῦν μευ, Ἰθακήσιοι, ὅττι κεν εἴπω·
and greeted him in speech, and clasped his hands. Then they sat down in order beside Dolius, their father. So they were busied with their meal in the halls; but meanwhile Rumor, the messenger, went swiftly throughout all the city, telling of the terrible death and fate of the wooers.	ὑμετέρῃ κακότητι, φίλοι, τάδε ἔργα γένοντο· οὐ γὰρ ἐμοὶ πείθεσθʼ, οὐ Μέντορι ποιμένι λαῶν, ὑμετέρους παῖδας καταπαυέμεν ἀφροσυνάων, οἳ μέγα ἔργον ἔρεξαν ἀτασθαλίῃσι κακῇσι, κτήματα κείροντες καὶ ἀτιμάζοντες ἄκοιτιν
 And the people heard it all at once, and gathered from every side with moanings and wailings before the palace of Odysseus. Forth from the halls they brought each his dead, and buried them; and those from other cities they sent each to his own home, placing them on swift ships for seamen to bear them,	ἀνδρὸς ἀριστῆος· τὸν δʼ οὐκέτι φάντο νέεσθαι. καὶ νῦν ὧδε γένοιτο. πίθεσθέ μοι ὡς ἀγορεύω· μὴ ἴομεν, μή πού τις ἐπίσπαστον κακὸν εὕρῃ. ὣς ἔφαθʼ, οἱ δʼ ἄρʼ ἀνήϊξαν μεγάλῳ ἀλαλητῷ ἡμίσεων πλείους· τοὶ δʼ ἀθρόοι αὐτόθι μίμνον·
 but they themselves went together to the place of assembly, sad at heart. Now when they were assembled and met together Eupeithes arose and spoke among them, for comfortless grief for his son lay heavy on his heart, even for Antinous, the first man whom goodly Odysseus had slain.	οὐ γὰρ σφιν ἅδε μῦθος ἐνὶ φρεσίν, ἀλλʼ Εὐπείθει πείθοντʼ· αἶψα δʼ ἔπειτʼ ἐπὶ τεύχεα ἐσσεύοντο. αὐτὰρ ἐπεί ῥʼ ἕσσαντο περὶ χροῒ νώροπα χαλκόν, ἀθρόοι ἠγερέθοντο πρὸ ἄστεος εὐρυχόροιο. τοῖσιν δʼ Εὐπείθης ἡγήσατο νηπιέῃσι·
Weeping for him he addressed their assembly and said: “Friends, a monstrous deed has this man of a truth devised against the Achaeans. Some he led forth in his ships, many men and goodly, and he has lost his hollow ships and utterly lost his men; and others again has he slain on his return, and these by far the best of the Cephallenians.	φῆ δʼ ὅ γε τίσεσθαι παιδὸς φόνον, οὐδʼ ἄρʼ ἔμελλεν ἂψ ἀπονοστήσειν, ἀλλʼ αὐτοῦ πότμον ἐφέψειν. αὐτὰρ Ἀθηναίη Ζῆνα Κρονίωνα προσηύδα· ὦ πάτερ ἡμέτερε, Κρονίδη, ὕπατε κρειόντων, εἰπέ μοι εἰρομένῃ, τί νύ τοι νόος ἔνδοθι κεύθει;
Nay then, come, before the fellow goes swiftly to Pylos or to goodly Elis , where the Epeans hold sway, let us go forth; verily even in days to come shall we be disgraced forever. For a shame is this even for men that are yet to be to hear of, if we shall not	ἢ προτέρω πόλεμόν τε κακὸν καὶ φύλοπιν αἰνὴν τεύξεις, ἦ φιλότητα μετʼ ἀμφοτέροισι τίθησθα; τὴν δʼ ἀπαμειβόμενος προσέφη νεφεληγερέτα Ζεύς· τέκνον ἐμόν, τί με ταῦτα διείρεαι ἠδὲ μεταλλᾷς; οὐ γὰρ δὴ τοῦτον μὲν ἐβούλευσας νόον αὐτή,
take vengeance on the slayers of our sons and our brothers. To me surely life would then no more be sweet; rather would I die at once and be among the dead. Nay, let us forth, lest they be too quick for us, and cross over the sea.” So he spoke, weeping, and pity laid hold of all the Achaeans. Then near them came Medon and the divine minstrel	ὡς ἦ τοι κείνους Ὀδυσεὺς ἀποτίσεται ἐλθών; ἔρξον ὅπως ἐθέλεις· ἐρέω τέ τοι ὡς ἐπέοικεν. ἐπεὶ δὴ μνηστῆρας ἐτίσατο δῖος Ὀδυσσεύς, ὅρκια πιστὰ ταμόντες ὁ μὲν βασιλευέτω αἰεί, ἡμεῖς δʼ αὖ παίδων τε κασιγνήτων τε φόνοιο
from the halls of Odysseus, for sleep had released them; and they took their stand in the midst, and wonder seized every man. Then Medon, wise of heart, spoke among them: “Hearken now to me, men of Ithaca , for verily not without the will of the immortal gods has Odysseus devised these deeds.	ἔκλησιν θέωμεν· τοὶ δʼ ἀλλήλους φιλεόντων ὡς τὸ πάρος, πλοῦτος δὲ καὶ εἰρήνη ἅλις ἔστω. ὣς εἰπὼν ὤτρυνε πάρος μεμαυῖαν Ἀθήνην, βῆ δὲ κατʼ Οὐλύμποιο καρήνων ἀΐξασα. οἱ δʼ ἐπεὶ οὖν σίτοιο μελίφρονος ἐξ ἔρον ἕντο,
Nay, I myself saw an immortal god, who stood close beside Odysseus, and seemed in all things like unto Mentor. Yet as an immortal god now in front of Odysseus would he appear, heartening him, and now again would rage through the hall, scaring the wooers; and they fell thick and fast.”	τοῖς δʼ ἄρα μύθων ἦρχε πολύτλας δῖος Ὀδυσσεύς· ἐξελθών τις ἴδοι μὴ δὴ σχεδὸν ὦσι κιόντες. ὣς ἔφατʼ· ἐκ δʼ υἱὸς Δολίου κίεν, ὡς ἐκέλευεν· στῆ δʼ ἄρʼ ἐπʼ οὐδὸν ἰών, τοὺς δὲ σχεδὸν ἔσιδε πάντας· αἶψα δʼ Ὀδυσσῆα ἔπεα πτερόεντα προσηύδα·
So he spoke, and thereat pale fear seized them all. Then among them spoke the old lord Halitherses, son of Mastor, for he alone saw before and after: he with good intent addressed their assembly, and said: “Hearken now to me, men of Ithaca , to the word that I shall say.	οἵδε δὴ ἐγγὺς ἔασʼ· ἀλλʼ ὁπλιζώμεθα θᾶσσον. ὣς ἔφαθʼ, οἱ δʼ ὤρνυντο καὶ ἐν τεύχεσσι δύοντο, τέσσαρες ἀμφʼ Ὀδυσῆʼ, ἓξ δʼ υἱεῖς οἱ Δολίοιο· ἐν δʼ ἄρα Λαέρτης Δολίος τʼ ἐς τεύχεʼ ἔδυνον, καὶ πολιοί περ ἐόντες, ἀναγκαῖοι πολεμισταί.
 Through your own cowardice, friends, have these deeds been brought to pass, for you would not obey me, nor Mentor, shepherd of the people, to make your sons cease from their folly. They wrought a monstrous deed in their blind and wanton wickedness, wasting the wealth and dishonoring the wife	αὐτὰρ ἐπεί ῥʼ ἕσσαντο περὶ χροῒ νώροπα χαλκόν, ὤϊξάν ῥα θύρας, ἐκ δʼ ἤϊον, ἄρχε δʼ Ὀδυσσεύς. τοῖσι δʼ ἐπʼ ἀγχίμολον θυγάτηρ Διὸς ἦλθεν Ἀθήνη Μέντορι εἰδομένη ἠμὲν δέμας ἠδὲ καὶ αὐδήν. τὴν μὲν ἰδὼν γήθησε πολύτλας δῖος Ὀδυσσεύς·
of a prince, who, they said, would never more return. Now then be it thus; and do you hearken to me, as I bid. Let us not go forth, lest haply many a one shall find a bane which he has brought upon himself.” So he spoke, but they sprang up with loud cries, more than half of them, but the rest remained together in their seats;	αἶψα δὲ Τηλέμαχον προσεφώνεεν ὃν φίλον υἱόν· Τηλέμαχʼ, ἤδη μὲν τόδε γʼ εἴσεαι αὐτὸς ἐπελθών, ἀνδρῶν μαρναμένων ἵνα τε κρίνονται ἄριστοι, μή τι καταισχύνειν πατέρων γένος, οἳ τὸ πάρος περ ἀλκῇ τʼ ἠνορέῃ τε κεκάσμεθα πᾶσαν ἐπʼ αἶαν.
 for his speech was not to their mind, but they hearkened to Eupeithes, and quickly thereafter they rushed for their arms. Then when they had clothed their bodies in gleaming bronze, they gathered together in front of the spacious city. And Eupeithes led them in his folly,	τὸν δʼ αὖ Τηλέμαχος πεπνυμένος ἀντίον ηὔδα· ὄψεαι, αἴ κʼ ἐθέλῃσθα, πάτερ φίλε, τῷδʼ ἐπὶ θυμῷ οὔ τι καταισχύνοντα τεὸν γένος, ὡς ἀγορεύεις. ὣς φάτο, Λαέρτης δʼ ἐχάρη καὶ μῦθον ἔειπε· τίς νύ μοι ἡμέρη ἥδε, θεοὶ φίλοι; ἦ μάλα χαίρω·
for he thought to avenge the slaying of his son; yet he was himself never more to come back, but was there to meet his doom. But Athena spoke to Zeus, son of Cronos, saying: “Father of us all, thou son of Cronos, high above all lords, tell to me that ask thee what purpose thy mind now hides within thee.	υἱός θʼ υἱωνός τʼ ἀρετῆς πέρι δῆριν ἔχουσιν. τὸν δὲ παρισταμένη προσέφη γλαυκῶπις Ἀθήνη· ὦ Ἀρκεισιάδη, πάντων πολὺ φίλταθʼ ἑταίρων, εὐξάμενος κούρῃ γλαυκώπιδι καὶ Διὶ πατρί, αἶψα μαλʼ ἀμπεπαλὼν προΐει δολιχόσκιον ἔγχος.
Wilt thou yet further bring to pass evil war and the dread din of battle, or wilt thou establish friendship betwixt the twain?” Then Zeus, the cloud-gatherer, answered her, and said: “My child, why dost thou ask and question me of this? Didst thou not thyself devise this plan,	ὣς φάτο, καί ῥʼ ἔμπνευσε μένος μέγα Παλλὰς Ἀθήνη εὐξάμενος δʼ ἄρʼ ἔπειτα Διὸς κούρῃ μεγάλοιο, αἶψα μάλʼ ἀμπεπαλὼν προΐει δολιχόσκιον ἔγχος, καὶ βάλεν Εὐπείθεα κόρυθος διὰ χαλκοπαρῄου. ἡ δʼ οὐκ ἔγχος ἔρυτο, διαπρὸ δὲ εἴσατο χαλκός,
 that verily Odysseus should take vengeance on these men at his coming? Do as thou wilt, but I will tell thee what is fitting. Now that goodly Odysseus has taken vengeance on the wooers, let them swear a solemn oath, and let him be king all his days, and let us on our part	δούπησεν δὲ πεσών, ἀράβησε δὲ τεύχεʼ ἐπʼ αὐτῷ. ἐν δʼ ἔπεσον προμάχοις Ὀδυσεὺς καὶ φαίδιμος υἱός, τύπτον δὲ ξίφεσίν τε καὶ ἔγχεσιν ἀμφιγύοισι. καί νύ κε δὴ πάντας ὄλεσαν καὶ ἔθηκαν ἀνόστους, εἰ μὴ Ἀθηναίη, κούρη Διὸς αἰγιόχοιο,
bring about a forgetting of the slaying of their sons and brothers; and let them love one another as before, and let wealth and peace abound.” So saying, he roused Athena, who was already eager, and she went darting down from the heights of Olympus . But when they had put from them the desire of honey-hearted food,	ἤϋσεν φωνῇ, κατὰ ἔσχεθε λαὸν ἅπαντα. ἴσχεσθε πτολέμου, Ἰθακήσιοι, ἀργαλέοιο, ὥς κεν ἀναιμωτί γε διακρινθῆτε τάχιστα. ὣς φάτʼ Ἀθηναίη, τοὺς δὲ χλωρὸν δέος εἷλεν· τῶν δʼ ἄρα δεισάντων ἐκ χειρῶν ἔπτατο τεύχεα,
the much-enduring, goodly Odysseus was the first to speak among his company, saying: “Let one go forth and see whether they be not now drawing near.” So he spoke, and a son of Dolius went forth, as he bade; he went and stood upon the threshold, and saw them all close at hand, and straightway he spoke to Odysseus winged words:	πάντα δʼ ἐπὶ χθονὶ πῖπτε, θεᾶς ὄπα φωνησάσης· πρὸς δὲ πόλιν τρωπῶντο λιλαιόμενοι βιότοιο. σμερδαλέον δʼ ἐβόησε πολύτλας δῖος Ὀδυσσεύς, οἴμησεν δὲ ἀλεὶς ὥς τʼ αἰετὸς ὑψιπετήεις. καὶ τότε δὴ Κρονίδης ἀφίει ψολόεντα κεραυνόν,
“Here they are close at hand. Quick, let us arm.” So he spoke, and they rose up and arrayed themselves in armour: Odysseus and his men were four, and six the sons of Dolius, and among them Laertes and Dolius donned their armour, grey-headed though they were, warriors perforce.	κὰδ δʼ ἔπεσε πρόσθε γλαυκώπιδος ὀβριμοπάτρης. δὴ τότʼ Ὀδυσσῆα προσέφη γλαυκῶπις Ἀθήνη· διογενὲς Λαερτιάδη, πολυμήχανʼ Ὀδυσσεῦ, ἴσχεο, παῦε δὲ νεῖκος ὁμοιΐου πολέμοιο, μή πως τοι Κρονίδης κεχολώσεται εὐρύοπα Ζεύς.
But when they had clothed their bodies in gleaming bronze, they opened the doors and went forth, and Odysseus led them. Then Athena, daughter of Zeus, drew near them in the likeness of Mentor both in form and in voice, and the much-enduring, goodly Odysseus was glad at sight of her, and straightway spoke to Telemachus, his dear son: “Telemachus, now shalt thou learn this—having thyself come to the place of battle, where the best warriors are put to the trial—to bring no disgrace upon the house of thy fathers, for we have ever excelled in strength and in valor over all the earth.” And wise Telemachus answered him: “Thou shalt see me, if thou wilt, dear father, in my present temper, bringing no disgrace upon thy house, even as thou sayest.” So said he, and Laertes was glad, and spoke, saying: “What a day is this for me, kind gods! Verily right glad am I: my son and my son's son are vying with one another in valor.” Then flashing-eyed Athena came near him and said: “Son of Arceisius, far the dearest of all my friends, make a prayer to the flashing-eyed maiden and to father Zeus, and then straightway raise aloft thy long spear, and hurl it.” So spoke Pallas Athena, and breathed into him great might. Then he prayed to the daughter of great Zeus, and straightway raised aloft his long spear, and hurled it, and smote Eupeithes through the helmet with cheek-piece of bronze. This stayed not the spear, but the bronze passed through, and he fell with a thud, and his armour clanged about him. Then on the foremost fighters fell Odysseus and his glorious son, and thrust at them with swords and double-pointed spears. And now would they have slain them all, and cut them off from returning, had not Athena, daughter of Zeus, who bears the aegis, shouted aloud, and checked all the host, saying: “Refrain, men of Ithaca , from grievous war, that with all speed you may part, and that without bloodshed.” So spoke Athena, and pale fear seized them. Then in their terror the arms flew from their hands and fell one and all to the ground, as the goddess uttered her voice, and they turned toward the city, eager to save their lives. Terribly then shouted the much-enduring, goodly Odysseus, and gathering himself together he swooped upon them like an eagle of lofty flight, and at that moment the son of Cronos cast a flaming thunderbolt, and down it fell before the flashing-eyed daughter of the mighty sire. Then flashing-eyed Athena spoke to Odysseus saying: “Son of Laertes, sprung from Zeus, Odysseus of many devices, stay thy hand, and make the strife of equal war to cease, lest haply the son of Cronos be wroth with thee, even Zeus, whose voice is borne afar.” So spoke Athena, and he obeyed, and was glad at heart. Then for all time to come a solemn covenant betwixt the twain was made by Pallas Athena, daughter of Zeus, who bears the aegis, in the likeness of Mentor both in form and in voice.	ὣς φάτʼ Ἀθηναίη, ὁ δʼ ἐπείθετο, χαῖρε δὲ θυμῷ. ὅρκια δʼ αὖ κατόπισθε μετʼ ἀμφοτέροισιν ἔθηκεν Παλλὰς Ἀθηναίη, κούρη Διὸς αἰγιόχοιο, Μέντορι εἰδομένη ἠμὲν δέμας ἠδὲ καὶ αὐδήν.
Tell me, O Muse, of that many-sided hero who traveled far and wide after he had sacked the famous town of Troy . Many cities did he visit, and many were the people with whose customs and thinking   he was acquainted; many things he suffered at sea while seeking to save his own life   and to achieve the safe homecoming   of his companions; but do what he might he could not save his men, for they perished through their own sheer recklessness in eating the cattle of the Sun-god Helios; so the god prevented them from ever reaching home. Tell me, as you have told those who came before me, about all these things, O daughter of Zeus, starting from whatsoever point you choose.	ἄνδρα μοι ἔννεπε, μοῦσα, πολύτροπον, ὃς μάλα πολλὰ πλάγχθη, ἐπεὶ Τροίης ἱερὸν πτολίεθρον ἔπερσεν· πολλῶν δʼ ἀνθρώπων ἴδεν ἄστεα καὶ νόον ἔγνω, πολλὰ δʼ ὅ γʼ ἐν πόντῳ πάθεν ἄλγεα ὃν κατὰ θυμόν, ἀρνύμενος ἥν τε ψυχὴν καὶ νόστον ἑταίρων. ἀλλʼ οὐδʼ ὣς ἑτάρους ἐρρύσατο, ἱέμενός περ· αὐτῶν γὰρ σφετέρῃσιν ἀτασθαλίῃσιν ὄλοντο, νήπιοι, οἳ κατὰ βοῦς Ὑπερίονος Ἠελίοιο ἤσθιον· αὐτὰρ ὁ τοῖσιν ἀφείλετο νόστιμον ἦμαρ. τῶν ἁμόθεν γε, θεά, θύγατερ Διός, εἰπὲ καὶ ἡμῖν.
So now all who escaped death in battle or by shipwreck had got safely home except Odysseus, and he, though he was longing for his return   to his wife and country, was detained by the goddess Calypso, who had got him into a large cave and wanted to marry him. But as years went by, there came a time when the gods settled that he should go back to Ithaca ; even then, however, when he was among his own people, his trials   were not yet over; nevertheless all the gods had now begun to pity him except Poseidon, who still persecuted him without ceasing and would not let him get home.	ἔνθʼ ἄλλοι μὲν πάντες, ὅσοι φύγον αἰπὺν ὄλεθρον, οἴκοι ἔσαν, πόλεμόν τε πεφευγότες ἠδὲ θάλασσαν· τὸν δʼ οἶον νόστου κεχρημένον ἠδὲ γυναικὸς νύμφη πότνιʼ ἔρυκε Καλυψὼ δῖα θεάων ἐν σπέσσι γλαφυροῖσι, λιλαιομένη πόσιν εἶναι. ἀλλʼ ὅτε δὴ ἔτος ἦλθε περιπλομένων ἐνιαυτῶν, τῷ οἱ ἐπεκλώσαντο θεοὶ οἶκόνδε νέεσθαι εἰς Ἰθάκην, οὐδʼ ἔνθα πεφυγμένος ἦεν ἀέθλων καὶ μετὰ οἷσι φίλοισι. θεοὶ δʼ ἐλέαιρον ἅπαντες νόσφι Ποσειδάωνος· ὁ δʼ ἀσπερχὲς μενέαινεν ἀντιθέῳ Ὀδυσῆι πάρος ἣν γαῖαν ἱκέσθαι.
Now Poseidon had gone off to the Ethiopians, who are at the world's end, and lie in two halves, the one looking West and the other East. He had gone there to accept a hecatomb of sheep and oxen, and was enjoying himself at his festival; but the other gods met in the house of Olympian Zeus, and the sire of gods and men spoke first. At that moment he was thinking of Aigisthos, who had been killed by Agamemnon's son Orestes; so he said to the other gods:	ἀλλʼ ὁ μὲν Αἰθίοπας μετεκίαθε τηλόθʼ ἐόντας, Αἰθίοπας τοὶ διχθὰ δεδαίαται, ἔσχατοι ἀνδρῶν, οἱ μὲν δυσομένου Ὑπερίονος οἱ δʼ ἀνιόντος, ἀντιόων ταύρων τε καὶ ἀρνειῶν ἑκατόμβης. ἔνθʼ ὅ γʼ ἐτέρπετο δαιτὶ παρήμενος· οἱ δὲ δὴ ἄλλοι Ζηνὸς ἐνὶ μεγάροισιν Ὀλυμπίου ἁθρόοι ἦσαν. τοῖσι δὲ μύθων ἦρχε πατὴρ ἀνδρῶν τε θεῶν τε· μνήσατο γὰρ κατὰ θυμὸν ἀμύμονος Αἰγίσθοιο, τόν ῥʼ Ἀγαμεμνονίδης τηλεκλυτὸς ἔκτανʼ Ὀρέστης· τοῦ ὅ γʼ ἐπιμνησθεὶς ἔπεʼ ἀθανάτοισι μετηύδα·
"""See now, how men consider us gods responsible   for what is after all nothing but their own folly. Look at Aigisthos; he must needs make love to Agamemnon's wife unrighteously and then kill Agamemnon, though he knew it would be the death of him; for I sent Hermes to warn him not to do either of these things, inasmuch as Orestes would be sure to take his revenge when he grew up and wanted to return home. Hermes told him this in all good will but he would not listen, and now he has paid for everything in full."""	ὢ πόποι, οἷον δή νυ θεοὺς βροτοὶ αἰτιόωνται· ἐξ ἡμέων γάρ φασι κάκʼ ἔμμεναι, οἱ δὲ καὶ αὐτοὶ σφῇσιν ἀτασθαλίῃσιν ὑπὲρ μόρον ἄλγεʼ ἔχουσιν, ὡς καὶ νῦν Αἴγισθος ὑπὲρ μόρον Ἀτρεΐδαο γῆμʼ ἄλοχον μνηστήν, τὸν δʼ ἔκτανε νοστήσαντα, εἰδὼς αἰπὺν ὄλεθρον, ἐπεὶ πρό οἱ εἴπομεν ἡμεῖς, Ἑρμείαν πέμψαντες, ἐύσκοπον ἀργεϊφόντην, μήτʼ αὐτὸν κτείνειν μήτε μνάασθαι ἄκοιτιν· ἐκ γὰρ Ὀρέσταο τίσις ἔσσεται Ἀτρεΐδαο, ὁππότʼ ἂν ἡβήσῃ τε καὶ ἧς ἱμείρεται αἴης. ὣς ἔφαθʼ Ἑρμείας, ἀλλʼ οὐ φρένας Αἰγίσθοιο πεῖθʼ ἀγαθὰ φρονέων· νῦν δʼ ἁθρόα πάντʼ ἀπέτισεν.
"Then Athena said, ""Father, son of Kronos, King of kings, it served Aigisthos right, and so it would any one else who does as he did; but Aigisthos is neither here nor there; it is for Odysseus that my heart bleeds, when I think of his sufferings in that lonely sea-girt island, far away, poor man, from all his friends. It is an island covered with forest, in the very middle of the sea, and a goddess lives there, daughter of the magician Atlas, who looks after the bottom of the ocean, and carries the great columns that keep heaven and earth asunder. This daughter of Atlas has got hold of poor unhappy Odysseus, and keeps trying by every kind of blandishment to make him forget his home, so that he is tired of life, and thinks of nothing but how he may once more see the smoke of his own chimneys. You, sir, take no heed of this, and yet when Odysseus was before Troy did he not propitiate you with many a burnt sacrifice? Why then should you keep on being so angry with him?"""	τὸν δʼ ἠμείβετʼ ἔπειτα θεά, γλαυκῶπις Ἀθήνη· ὦ πάτερ ἡμέτερε Κρονίδη, ὕπατε κρειόντων, καὶ λίην κεῖνός γε ἐοικότι κεῖται ὀλέθρῳ· ὡς ἀπόλοιτο καὶ ἄλλος, ὅτις τοιαῦτά γε ῥέζοι· ἀλλά μοι ἀμφʼ Ὀδυσῆι δαΐφρονι δαίεται ἦτορ, δυσμόρῳ, ὃς δὴ δηθὰ φίλων ἄπο πήματα πάσχει νήσῳ ἐν ἀμφιρύτῃ, ὅθι τʼ ὀμφαλός ἐστι θαλάσσης. νῆσος δενδρήεσσα, θεὰ δʼ ἐν δώματα ναίει, Ἄτλαντος θυγάτηρ ὀλοόφρονος, ὅς τε θαλάσσης πάσης βένθεα οἶδεν, ἔχει δέ τε κίονας αὐτὸς μακράς, αἳ γαῖάν τε καὶ οὐρανὸν ἀμφὶς ἔχουσιν. τοῦ θυγάτηρ δύστηνον ὀδυρόμενον κατερύκει, αἰεὶ δὲ μαλακοῖσι καὶ αἱμυλίοισι λόγοισιν θέλγει, ὅπως Ἰθάκης ἐπιλήσεται· αὐτὰρ Ὀδυσσεύς, ἱέμενος καὶ καπνὸν ἀποθρῴσκοντα νοῆσαι ἧς γαίης, θανέειν ἱμείρεται. οὐδέ νυ σοί περ ἐντρέπεται φίλον ἦτορ, Ὀλύμπιε. οὔ νύ τʼ Ὀδυσσεὺς Ἀργείων παρὰ νηυσὶ χαρίζετο ἱερὰ ῥέζων Τροίῃ ἐν εὐρείῃ; τί νύ οἱ τόσον ὠδύσαο, Ζεῦ;
"And Zeus said, ""My child, what are you talking about? How can I forget Odysseus than whom there is no more capable man on earth in regard to , nor more liberal in his offerings to the immortal gods that live in heaven? Bear in mind, however, that Poseidon is still furious with Odysseus for having blinded an eye of Polyphemus king of the Cyclopes. Polyphemus is son to Poseidon by the nymph Thoosa, daughter to the sea-king Phorkys; therefore though he will not kill Odysseus outright, he torments him by preventing him from his homecoming  . Still, let us lay our heads together and see how we can help him to return; Poseidon will then be pacified, for if we are all of a mind he can hardly stand out against us."""	τὴν δʼ ἀπαμειβόμενος προσέφη νεφεληγερέτα Ζεύς· τέκνον ἐμόν, ποῖόν σε ἔπος φύγεν ἕρκος ὀδόντων. πῶς ἂν ἔπειτʼ Ὀδυσῆος ἐγὼ θείοιο λαθοίμην, ὃς περὶ μὲν νόον ἐστὶ βροτῶν, περὶ δʼ ἱρὰ θεοῖσιν ἀθανάτοισιν ἔδωκε, τοὶ οὐρανὸν εὐρὺν ἔχουσιν; ἀλλὰ Ποσειδάων γαιήοχος ἀσκελὲς αἰεὶ Κύκλωπος κεχόλωται, ὃν ὀφθαλμοῦ ἀλάωσεν, ἀντίθεον Πολύφημον, ὅου κράτος ἐστὶ μέγιστον πᾶσιν Κυκλώπεσσι· Θόωσα δέ μιν τέκε νύμφη, Φόρκυνος θυγάτηρ ἁλὸς ἀτρυγέτοιο μέδοντος, ἐν σπέσσι γλαφυροῖσι Ποσειδάωνι μιγεῖσα. ἐκ τοῦ δὴ Ὀδυσῆα Ποσειδάων ἐνοσίχθων οὔ τι κατακτείνει, πλάζει δʼ ἀπὸ πατρίδος αἴης. ἀλλʼ ἄγεθʼ, ἡμεῖς οἵδε περιφραζώμεθα πάντες νόστον, ὅπως ἔλθῃσι· Ποσειδάων δὲ μεθήσει ὃν χόλον· οὐ μὲν γάρ τι δυνήσεται ἀντία πάντων ἀθανάτων ἀέκητι θεῶν ἐριδαινέμεν οἶος.
"And Athena said, ""Father, son of Kronos, King of kings, if, then, the gods now mean that Odysseus should get home, we should first send Hermes to the Ogygian island to tell Calypso that we have made up our minds and that he is to have his homecoming  . In the meantime I will go to Ithaca , to put heart into Odysseus' son Telemakhos; I will embolden him to call the Achaeans in assembly, and speak out to the suitors of his mother Penelope, who persist in eating up any number of his sheep and oxen; I will also conduct him to Sparta and to Pylos , to see if he can hear anything about the return   of his dear father - for this will give him genuine fame   throughout humankind."""	τὸν δʼ ἠμείβετʼ ἔπειτα θεά, γλαυκῶπις Ἀθήνη· ὦ πάτερ ἡμέτερε Κρονίδη, ὕπατε κρειόντων, εἰ μὲν δὴ νῦν τοῦτο φίλον μακάρεσσι θεοῖσιν, νοστῆσαι Ὀδυσῆα πολύφρονα ὅνδε δόμονδε, Ἑρμείαν μὲν ἔπειτα διάκτορον ἀργεϊφόντην νῆσον ἐς Ὠγυγίην ὀτρύνομεν, ὄφρα τάχιστα νύμφῃ ἐυπλοκάμῳ εἴπῃ νημερτέα βουλήν, νόστον Ὀδυσσῆος ταλασίφρονος, ὥς κε νέηται· αὐτὰρ ἐγὼν Ἰθάκηνδʼ ἐσελεύσομαι, ὄφρα οἱ υἱὸν μᾶλλον ἐποτρύνω καί οἱ μένος ἐν φρεσὶ θείω, εἰς ἀγορὴν καλέσαντα κάρη κομόωντας Ἀχαιοὺς πᾶσι μνηστήρεσσιν ἀπειπέμεν, οἵ τέ οἱ αἰεὶ μῆλʼ ἁδινὰ σφάζουσι καὶ εἰλίποδας ἕλικας βοῦς. πέμψω δʼ ἐς Σπάρτην τε καὶ ἐς Πύλον ἠμαθόεντα νόστον πευσόμενον πατρὸς φίλου, ἤν που ἀκούσῃ, ἠδʼ ἵνα μιν κλέος ἐσθλὸν ἐν ἀνθρώποισιν ἔχῃσιν.
So saying she bound on her glittering golden sandals, imperishable, with which she can fly like the wind over land or sea; she grasped the redoubtable bronze-shod spear, so stout and sturdy and strong, wherewith she quells the ranks of heroes who have displeased her, and down she darted from the topmost summits of Olympus , whereon forthwith she was in the of Ithaca , at the gateway of Odysseus' house, disguised as a visitor, Mentes, chief of the Taphians, and she held a bronze spear in her hand. There she found the lordly suitors seated on hides of the oxen which they had killed and eaten, and playing draughts in front of the house. Men-servants and pages were bustling about to wait upon them, some mixing wine with water in the mixing-bowls, some cleaning down the tables with wet sponges and laying them out again, and some cutting up great quantities of meat.	ὣς εἰποῦσʼ ὑπὸ ποσσὶν ἐδήσατο καλὰ πέδιλα, ἀμβρόσια χρύσεια, τά μιν φέρον ἠμὲν ἐφʼ ὑγρὴν ἠδʼ ἐπʼ ἀπείρονα γαῖαν ἅμα πνοιῇς ἀνέμοιο· εἵλετο δʼ ἄλκιμον ἔγχος, ἀκαχμένον ὀξέι χαλκῷ, βριθὺ μέγα στιβαρόν, τῷ δάμνησι στίχας ἀνδρῶν ἡρώων, τοῖσίν τε κοτέσσεται ὀβριμοπάτρη. βῆ δὲ κατʼ Οὐλύμποιο καρήνων ἀίξασα, στῆ δʼ Ἰθάκης ἐνὶ δήμῳ ἐπὶ προθύροις Ὀδυσῆος, οὐδοῦ ἐπʼ αὐλείου· παλάμῃ δʼ ἔχε χάλκεον ἔγχος, εἰδομένη ξείνῳ, Ταφίων ἡγήτορι Μέντῃ. εὗρε δʼ ἄρα μνηστῆρας ἀγήνορας. οἱ μὲν ἔπειτα πεσσοῖσι προπάροιθε θυράων θυμὸν ἔτερπον ἥμενοι ἐν ῥινοῖσι βοῶν, οὓς ἔκτανον αὐτοί· κήρυκες δʼ αὐτοῖσι καὶ ὀτρηροὶ θεράποντες οἱ μὲν οἶνον ἔμισγον ἐνὶ κρητῆρσι καὶ ὕδωρ, οἱ δʼ αὖτε σπόγγοισι πολυτρήτοισι τραπέζας νίζον καὶ πρότιθεν, τοὶ δὲ κρέα πολλὰ δατεῦντο.
"Telemakhos saw her long before any one else did. He was sitting moodily among the suitors thinking about his brave father, and how he would send them fleeing out of the house, if he were to come to his own again and be honored as in days gone by. Thus brooding as he sat among them, he caught sight of Athena and went straight to the gate, for he was vexed that a stranger should be kept waiting for admittance. He took her right hand in his own, and bade her give him her spear. ""Welcome,"" said he, ""to our house, and when you have partaken of food you shall tell us what you have come for."""	τὴν δὲ πολὺ πρῶτος ἴδε Τηλέμαχος θεοειδής, ἧστο γὰρ ἐν μνηστῆρσι φίλον τετιημένος ἦτορ, ὀσσόμενος πατέρʼ ἐσθλὸν ἐνὶ φρεσίν, εἴ ποθεν ἐλθὼν μνηστήρων τῶν μὲν σκέδασιν κατὰ δώματα θείη, τιμὴν δʼ αὐτὸς ἔχοι καὶ δώμασιν οἷσιν ἀνάσσοι. τὰ φρονέων, μνηστῆρσι μεθήμενος, εἴσιδʼ Ἀθήνην. βῆ δʼ ἰθὺς προθύροιο, νεμεσσήθη δʼ ἐνὶ θυμῷ ξεῖνον δηθὰ θύρῃσιν ἐφεστάμεν· ἐγγύθι δὲ στὰς χεῖρʼ ἕλε δεξιτερὴν καὶ ἐδέξατο χάλκεον ἔγχος, καί μιν φωνήσας ἔπεα πτερόεντα προσηύδα· χαῖρε, ξεῖνε, παρʼ ἄμμι φιλήσεαι· αὐτὰρ ἔπειτα δείπνου πασσάμενος μυθήσεαι ὅττεό σε χρή.
He led the way as he spoke, and Athena followed him. When they were within he took her spear and set it in the spear - stand against a strong bearing-post along with the many other spears of his unhappy father, and he conducted her to a richly decorated seat under which he threw a cloth of damask. There was a footstool also for her feet, and he set another seat near her for himself, away from the suitors, that she might not be annoyed while eating by their noise and insolence, and that he might ask her more freely about his father.	ὣς εἰπὼν ἡγεῖθʼ, ἡ δʼ ἕσπετο Παλλὰς Ἀθήνη. οἱ δʼ ὅτε δή ῥʼ ἔντοσθεν ἔσαν δόμου ὑψηλοῖο, ἔγχος μέν ῥʼ ἔστησε φέρων πρὸς κίονα μακρὴν δουροδόκης ἔντοσθεν ἐυξόου, ἔνθα περ ἄλλα ἔγχεʼ Ὀδυσσῆος ταλασίφρονος ἵστατο πολλά, αὐτὴν δʼ ἐς θρόνον εἷσεν ἄγων, ὑπὸ λῖτα πετάσσας, καλὸν δαιδάλεον· ὑπὸ δὲ θρῆνυς ποσὶν ἦεν. πὰρ δʼ αὐτὸς κλισμὸν θέτο ποικίλον, ἔκτοθεν ἄλλων μνηστήρων, μὴ ξεῖνος ἀνιηθεὶς ὀρυμαγδῷ δείπνῳ ἁδήσειεν, ὑπερφιάλοισι μετελθών, ἠδʼ ἵνα μιν περὶ πατρὸς ἀποιχομένοιο ἔροιτο.
A maid servant then brought them water in a beautiful golden ewer and poured it into a silver basin for them to wash their hands, and she drew a clean table beside them. An upper servant brought them bread, and offered them many good things of what there was in the house, the carver fetched them plates of all manner of meats and set cups of gold by their side, and a man-servant brought them wine and poured it out for them.	χέρνιβα δʼ ἀμφίπολος προχόῳ ἐπέχευε φέρουσα καλῇ χρυσείῃ, ὑπὲρ ἀργυρέοιο λέβητος, νίψασθαι· παρὰ δὲ ξεστὴν ἐτάνυσσε τράπεζαν. σῖτον δʼ αἰδοίη ταμίη παρέθηκε φέρουσα, εἴδατα πόλλʼ ἐπιθεῖσα, χαριζομένη παρεόντων· δαιτρὸς δὲ κρειῶν πίνακας παρέθηκεν ἀείρας παντοίων, παρὰ δέ σφι τίθει χρύσεια κύπελλα· κῆρυξ δʼ αὐτοῖσιν θάμʼ ἐπῴχετο οἰνοχοεύων.
Then the suitors came in and took their places on the benches and seats. Forthwith men servants poured water over their hands, maids went round with the bread-baskets, pages filled the mixing-bowls with wine and water, and they laid their hands upon the good things that were before them. As soon as they had had enough to eat and drink they wanted music and dancing, which are the crowning embellishments of a banquet, so a servant brought a lyre to Phemios, whom they compelled perforce to sing to them. As soon as he touched his lyre and began to sing Telemakhos spoke low to Athena, with his head close to hers that no man might hear.	ἐς δʼ ἦλθον μνηστῆρες ἀγήνορες. οἱ μὲν ἔπειτα ἑξείης ἕζοντο κατὰ κλισμούς τε θρόνους τε, τοῖσι δὲ κήρυκες μὲν ὕδωρ ἐπὶ χεῖρας ἔχευαν, σῖτον δὲ δμῳαὶ παρενήνεον ἐν κανέοισιν, κοῦροι δὲ κρητῆρας ἐπεστέψαντο ποτοῖο. οἱ δʼ ἐπʼ ὀνείαθʼ ἑτοῖμα προκείμενα χεῖρας ἴαλλον. αὐτὰρ ἐπεὶ πόσιος καὶ ἐδητύος ἐξ ἔρον ἕντο μνηστῆρες, τοῖσιν μὲν ἐνὶ φρεσὶν ἄλλα μεμήλει, μολπή τʼ ὀρχηστύς τε· τὰ γάρ τʼ ἀναθήματα δαιτός· κῆρυξ δʼ ἐν χερσὶν κίθαριν περικαλλέα θῆκεν Φημίῳ, ὅς ῥʼ ἤειδε παρὰ μνηστῆρσιν ἀνάγκῃ. ἦ τοι ὁ φορμίζων ἀνεβάλλετο καλὸν ἀείδειν. αὐτὰρ Τηλέμαχος προσέφη γλαυκῶπιν Ἀθήνην, ἄγχι σχὼν κεφαλήν, ἵνα μὴ πευθοίαθʼ οἱ ἄλλοι·
"""I hope, sir,"" said he, ""that you will not be offended with what I am going to say. Singing comes cheap to those who do not pay for it, and all this is done at the cost of one whose bones lie rotting in some wilderness or grinding to powder in the surf. If these men were to see my father come back to Ithaca they would pray for longer legs rather than a longer purse, for wealth would not serve them; but he, alas, has fallen on an ill fate, and even when people do sometimes say that he is coming, we no longer heed them; we shall never see him again. And now, sir, tell me and tell me true, who you are and where you come from. Tell me of your town and parents, what manner of ship you came in, how your crew brought you to Ithaca , and of what nation they declared themselves to be - for you cannot have come by land. Tell me also truly, for I want to know, are you a stranger to this house, or have you been here in my father's time? In the old days we had many visitors for my father went about much himself."""	ξεῖνε φίλʼ, ἦ καί μοι νεμεσήσεαι ὅττι κεν εἴπω; τούτοισιν μὲν ταῦτα μέλει, κίθαρις καὶ ἀοιδή, ῥεῖʼ, ἐπεὶ ἀλλότριον βίοτον νήποινον ἔδουσιν, ἀνέρος, οὗ δή που λεύκʼ ὀστέα πύθεται ὄμβρῳ κείμενʼ ἐπʼ ἠπείρου, ἢ εἰν ἁλὶ κῦμα κυλίνδει. εἰ κεῖνόν γʼ Ἰθάκηνδε ἰδοίατο νοστήσαντα, πάντες κʼ ἀρησαίατʼ ἐλαφρότεροι πόδας εἶναι ἢ ἀφνειότεροι χρυσοῖό τε ἐσθῆτός τε. νῦν δʼ ὁ μὲν ὣς ἀπόλωλε κακὸν μόρον, οὐδέ τις ἡμῖν θαλπωρή, εἴ πέρ τις ἐπιχθονίων ἀνθρώπων φῇσιν ἐλεύσεσθαι· τοῦ δʼ ὤλετο νόστιμον ἦμαρ. ἀλλʼ ἄγε μοι τόδε εἰπὲ καὶ ἀτρεκέως κατάλεξον· τίς πόθεν εἰς ἀνδρῶν; πόθι τοι πόλις ἠδὲ τοκῆες; ὁπποίης τʼ ἐπὶ νηὸς ἀφίκεο· πῶς δέ σε ναῦται ἤγαγον εἰς Ἰθάκην; τίνες ἔμμεναι εὐχετόωντο; οὐ μὲν γάρ τί σε πεζὸν ὀίομαι ἐνθάδʼ ἱκέσθαι. καί μοι τοῦτʼ ἀγόρευσον ἐτήτυμον, ὄφρʼ ἐὺ εἰδῶ, ἠὲ νέον μεθέπεις ἦ καὶ πατρώιός ἐσσι ξεῖνος, ἐπεὶ πολλοὶ ἴσαν ἀνέρες ἡμέτερον δῶ ἄλλοι, ἐπεὶ καὶ κεῖνος ἐπίστροφος ἦν ἀνθρώπων.
"And Athena answered, ""I will tell you truly and particularly all about it. I am Mentes, son of Anchialos, and I am King of the Taphians. I have come here with my ship and crew, on a voyage to men of a foreign tongue being bound for Temesa with a cargo of iron, and I shall bring back copper. As for my ship, it lies over yonder off the open country away from the town, in the harbor Rheithron under the wooded mountain Neritum. Our fathers were friends before us, as old Laertes will tell you, if you will go and ask him. They say, however, that he never comes to town now, and lives by himself in the country, faring hardly, with an old woman to look after him and get his dinner for him, when he comes in tired from pottering about his vineyard. They told me your father was at home again, and that was why I came, but it seems the gods are still keeping him back, for he is not dead yet not on the mainland. It is more likely he is on some sea-girt island in mid ocean, or a prisoner among savages who are detaining him against his will. I am no seer  , and know very little about omens, but I speak as it is borne in upon me from heaven, and assure you that he will not be away much longer; for he is a man of such resource that even though he were in chains of iron he would find some means of getting home again. But tell me, and tell me true, can Odysseus really have such a fine looking young man for a son? You are indeed wonderfully like him about the head and eyes, for we were close friends before he set sail for Troy where the flower of all the Argives went also. Since that time we have never either of us seen the other."""	τὸν δʼ αὖτε προσέειπε θεά, γλαυκῶπις Ἀθήνη· τοιγὰρ ἐγώ τοι ταῦτα μάλʼ ἀτρεκέως ἀγορεύσω.

"And Athena said, ""There is no fear of your race dying out yet, while Penelope has such a fine son as you are. But tell me, and tell me true, what is the meaning of all this feasting, and who are these people? What is it all about? Have you some banquet, or is there a wedding in the family - for no one seems to be bringing any provisions of his own? And the guests - how atrociously they are behaving; what riot they make over the whole house; it is enough to disgust any respectable person who comes near them."""	θῆκαν, ἐπεὶ σέ γε τοῖον ἐγείνατο Πηνελόπεια. ἀλλʼ ἄγε μοι τόδε εἰπὲ καὶ ἀτρεκέως κατάλεξον· τίς δαίς, τίς δὲ ὅμιλος ὅδʼ ἔπλετο; τίπτε δέ σε χρεώ; εἰλαπίνη ἠὲ γάμος; ἐπεὶ οὐκ ἔρανος τάδε γʼ ἐστίν· ὥς τέ μοι ὑβρίζοντες ὑπερφιάλως δοκέουσι δαίνυσθαι κατὰ δῶμα. νεμεσσήσαιτό κεν ἀνὴρ αἴσχεα πόλλʼ ὁρόων, ὅς τις πινυτός γε μετέλθοι.
"""Sir,"" said Telemakhos, ""as regards your question, so long as my father was here it was well with us and with the house, but the gods in their displeasure have willed it otherwise, and have hidden him away more closely than mortal man was ever yet hidden. I could have borne it better even though he were dead, if he had fallen with his men in the of Troy , or had died with friends around him when the days of his fighting were done; for then the Achaeans would have built a mound over his ashes, and I should myself have been heir to his renown  ; but now the storm-winds have spirited him away we know not wither; he is gone without leaving so much as a trace behind him, and I inherit nothing but dismay. Nor does the matter end simply with grief for the loss of my father; heaven has laid sorrows upon me of yet another kind; for the chiefs from all our islands, Dulichium, Same, and the woodland island of Zacynthus , as also all the principal men of Ithaca itself, are eating up my house under the pretext of paying their court to my mother, who will neither point blank say that she will not marry, nor yet bring matters to an end; so they are making havoc of my estate, and before long will do so also with myself."""	τὴν δʼ αὖ Τηλέμαχος πεπνυμένος ἀντίον ηὔδα· ξεῖνʼ, ἐπεὶ ἂρ δὴ ταῦτά μʼ ἀνείρεαι ἠδὲ μεταλλᾷς, μέλλεν μέν ποτε οἶκος ὅδʼ ἀφνειὸς καὶ ἀμύμων ἔμμεναι, ὄφρʼ ἔτι κεῖνος ἀνὴρ ἐπιδήμιος ἦεν· νῦν δʼ ἑτέρως ἐβόλοντο θεοὶ κακὰ μητιόωντες, οἳ κεῖνον μὲν ἄιστον ἐποίησαν περὶ πάντων ἀνθρώπων, ἐπεὶ οὔ κε θανόντι περ ὧδʼ ἀκαχοίμην, εἰ μετὰ οἷς ἑτάροισι δάμη Τρώων ἐνὶ δήμῳ, ἠὲ φίλων ἐν χερσίν, ἐπεὶ πόλεμον τολύπευσεν. τῷ κέν οἱ τύμβον μὲν ἐποίησαν Παναχαιοί, ἠδέ κε καὶ ᾧ παιδὶ μέγα κλέος ἤρατʼ ὀπίσσω. νῦν δέ μιν ἀκλειῶς ἅρπυιαι ἀνηρείψαντο· οἴχετʼ ἄιστος ἄπυστος, ἐμοὶ δʼ ὀδύνας τε γόους τε κάλλιπεν. οὐδέ τι κεῖνον ὀδυρόμενος στεναχίζω οἶον, ἐπεί νύ μοι ἄλλα θεοὶ κακὰ κήδεʼ ἔτευξαν. ὅσσοι γὰρ νήσοισιν ἐπικρατέουσιν ἄριστοι, Δουλιχίῳ τε Σάμῃ τε καὶ ὑλήεντι Ζακύνθῳ, ἠδʼ ὅσσοι κραναὴν Ἰθάκην κάτα κοιρανέουσιν, τόσσοι μητέρʼ ἐμὴν μνῶνται, τρύχουσι δὲ οἶκον. ἡ δʼ οὔτʼ ἀρνεῖται στυγερὸν γάμον οὔτε τελευτὴν ποιῆσαι δύναται· τοὶ δὲ φθινύθουσιν ἔδοντες οἶκον ἐμόν· τάχα δή με διαρραίσουσι καὶ αὐτόν.
"""Is that so?"" exclaimed Athena, ""then you do indeed want Odysseus home again. Give him his helmet, shield, and a couple lances, and if he is the man he was when I first knew him in our house, drinking and making merry, he would soon lay his hands about these rascally suitors, were he to stand once more upon his own threshold. He was then coming from Ephyra , where he had been to beg poison for his arrows from Ilos, son of Mermerus. Ilos feared the ever-living gods and would not give him any, but my father let him have some, for he was very fond of him. If Odysseus is the man he then was these suitors will have a swift doom and a sorry wedding."	τὸν δʼ ἐπαλαστήσασα προσηύδα Παλλὰς Ἀθήνη· ὢ πόποι, ἦ δὴ πολλὸν ἀποιχομένου Ὀδυσῆος δεύῃ, ὅ κε μνηστῆρσιν ἀναιδέσι χεῖρας ἐφείη. εἰ γὰρ νῦν ἐλθὼν δόμου ἐν πρώτῃσι θύρῃσι σταίη, ἔχων πήληκα καὶ ἀσπίδα καὶ δύο δοῦρε, τοῖος ἐὼν οἷόν μιν ἐγὼ τὰ πρῶτʼ ἐνόησα οἴκῳ ἐν ἡμετέρῳ πίνοντά τε τερπόμενόν τε, ἐξ Ἐφύρης ἀνιόντα παρʼ Ἴλου Μερμερίδαο— ᾤχετο γὰρ καὶ κεῖσε θοῆς ἐπὶ νηὸς Ὀδυσσεὺς φάρμακον ἀνδροφόνον διζήμενος, ὄφρα οἱ εἴη ἰοὺς χρίεσθαι χαλκήρεας· ἀλλʼ ὁ μὲν οὔ οἱ δῶκεν, ἐπεί ῥα θεοὺς νεμεσίζετο αἰὲν ἐόντας, ἀλλὰ πατήρ οἱ δῶκεν ἐμός· φιλέεσκε γὰρ αἰνῶς— τοῖος ἐὼν μνηστῆρσιν ὁμιλήσειεν Ὀδυσσεύς· πάντες κʼ ὠκύμοροί τε γενοίατο πικρόγαμοί τε.
"""But there! It rests with heaven to determine whether he is to return, and take his revenge in his own house or no; I would, however, urge you to set about trying to get rid of these suitors at once. Take my advice, call the Achaean heroes in assembly tomorrow -lay your case before them, and call heaven to bear you witness. Bid the suitors take themselves off, each to his own place, and if your mother's mind is set on marrying again, let her go back to her father, who will find her a husband and provide her with all the marriage gifts that so dear a daughter may expect. As for yourself, let me prevail upon you to take the best ship you can get, with a crew of twenty men, and go in quest of your father who has so long been missing. Some one may tell you something, or (and people often hear things in this way) some heaven-sent message   may direct you. First go to Pylos and ask Nestor; thence go on to Sparta and visit Menelaos, for he got home last of all the Achaeans; if you hear that your father is alive and about to achieve his homecoming  , you can put up with the waste these suitors will make for yet another twelve months. If on the other hand you hear of his death, come home at once, celebrate his funeral rites with all due pomp, build a grave marker   to his memory, and make your mother marry again. Then, having done all this, think it well over in your mind how, by fair means or foul, you may kill these suitors in your own house. You are too old to plead infancy any longer; have you not heard how people are singing Orestes' praises   for having killed his father's murderer Aigisthos? You are a fine, smart looking young man; show your mettle, then, and make yourself a name in story. Now, however, I must go back to my ship and to my crew, who will be impatient if I keep them waiting longer; think the matter over for yourself, and remember what I have said to you."""	ἀλλʼ ἦ τοι μὲν ταῦτα θεῶν ἐν γούνασι κεῖται, ἤ κεν νοστήσας ἀποτίσεται, ἦε καὶ οὐκί, οἷσιν ἐνὶ μεγάροισι· σὲ δὲ φράζεσθαι ἄνωγα, ὅππως κε μνηστῆρας ἀπώσεαι ἐκ μεγάροιο. εἰ δʼ ἄγε νῦν ξυνίει καὶ ἐμῶν ἐμπάζεο μύθων· αὔριον εἰς ἀγορὴν καλέσας ἥρωας Ἀχαιοὺς μῦθον πέφραδε πᾶσι, θεοὶ δʼ ἐπὶ μάρτυροι ἔστων. μνηστῆρας μὲν ἐπὶ σφέτερα σκίδνασθαι ἄνωχθι, μητέρα δʼ, εἴ οἱ θυμὸς ἐφορμᾶται γαμέεσθαι, ἂψ ἴτω ἐς μέγαρον πατρὸς μέγα δυναμένοιο· οἱ δὲ γάμον τεύξουσι καὶ ἀρτυνέουσιν ἔεδνα πολλὰ μάλʼ, ὅσσα ἔοικε φίλης ἐπὶ παιδὸς ἕπεσθαι. σοὶ δʼ αὐτῷ πυκινῶς ὑποθήσομαι, αἴ κε πίθηαι· νῆʼ ἄρσας ἐρέτῃσιν ἐείκοσιν, ἥ τις ἀρίστη, ἔρχεο πευσόμενος πατρὸς δὴν οἰχομένοιο, ἤν τίς τοι εἴπῃσι βροτῶν, ἢ ὄσσαν ἀκούσῃς ἐκ Διός, ἥ τε μάλιστα φέρει κλέος ἀνθρώποισι. πρῶτα μὲν ἐς Πύλον ἐλθὲ καὶ εἴρεο Νέστορα δῖον, κεῖθεν δὲ Σπάρτηνδε παρὰ ξανθὸν Μενέλαον· ὃς γὰρ δεύτατος ἦλθεν Ἀχαιῶν χαλκοχιτώνων. εἰ μέν κεν πατρὸς βίοτον καὶ νόστον ἀκούσῃς, ἦ τʼ ἂν τρυχόμενός περ ἔτι τλαίης ἐνιαυτόν· εἰ δέ κε τεθνηῶτος ἀκούσῃς μηδʼ ἔτʼ ἐόντος, νοστήσας δὴ ἔπειτα φίλην ἐς πατρίδα γαῖαν σῆμά τέ οἱ χεῦαι καὶ ἐπὶ κτέρεα κτερεΐξαι πολλὰ μάλʼ, ὅσσα ἔοικε, καὶ ἀνέρι μητέρα δοῦναι. αὐτὰρ ἐπὴν δὴ ταῦτα τελευτήσῃς τε καὶ ἔρξῃς, φράζεσθαι δὴ ἔπειτα κατὰ φρένα καὶ κατὰ θυμὸν ὅππως κε μνηστῆρας ἐνὶ μεγάροισι τεοῖσι κτείνῃς ἠὲ δόλῳ ἢ ἀμφαδόν· οὐδέ τί σε χρὴ νηπιάας ὀχέειν, ἐπεὶ οὐκέτι τηλίκος ἐσσι. ἢ οὐκ ἀίεις οἷον κλέος ἔλλαβε δῖος Ὀρέστης πάντας ἐπʼ ἀνθρώπους, ἐπεὶ ἔκτανε πατροφονῆα, Αἴγισθον δολόμητιν, ὅ οἱ πατέρα κλυτὸν ἔκτα; καὶ σύ, φίλος, μάλα γάρ σʼ ὁρόω καλόν τε μέγαν τε, ἄλκιμος ἔσσʼ, ἵνα τίς σε καὶ ὀψιγόνων ἐὺ εἴπῃ. αὐτὰρ ἐγὼν ἐπὶ νῆα θοὴν κατελεύσομαι ἤδη ἠδʼ ἑτάρους, οἵ πού με μάλʼ ἀσχαλόωσι μένοντες· σοὶ δʼ αὐτῷ μελέτω, καὶ ἐμῶν ἐμπάζεο μύθων.
"""Sir,"" answered Telemakhos, ""it has been very kind of you to talk to me in this way, as though I were your own son, and I will do all you tell me; I know you want to be getting on with your voyage, but stay a little longer till you have taken a bath and refreshed yourself. I will then give you a present, and you shall go on your way rejoicing; I will give you one of great beauty and value - a keepsake such as only dear friends give to one another."""	τὴν δʼ αὖ Τηλέμαχος πεπνυμένος ἀντίον ηὔδα· ξεῖνʼ, ἦ τοι μὲν ταῦτα φίλα φρονέων ἀγορεύεις, ὥς τε πατὴρ ᾧ παιδί, καὶ οὔ ποτε λήσομαι αὐτῶν. ἀλλʼ ἄγε νῦν ἐπίμεινον, ἐπειγόμενός περ ὁδοῖο, ὄφρα λοεσσάμενός τε τεταρπόμενός τε φίλον κῆρ, δῶρον ἔχων ἐπὶ νῆα κίῃς, χαίρων ἐνὶ θυμῷ, τιμῆεν, μάλα καλόν, ὅ τοι κειμήλιον ἔσται ἐξ ἐμεῦ, οἷα φίλοι ξεῖνοι ξείνοισι διδοῦσι.
"Athena answered, ""Do not try to keep me, for I would be on my way at once. As for any present you may be disposed to make me, keep it till I come again, and I will take it home with me. You shall give me a very good one, and I will give you one of no less value in return."""	τὸν δʼ ἠμείβετʼ ἔπειτα θεά, γλαυκῶπις Ἀθήνη· μή μʼ ἔτι νῦν κατέρυκε, λιλαιόμενόν περ ὁδοῖο. δῶρον δʼ ὅττι κέ μοι δοῦναι φίλον ἦτορ ἀνώγῃ, αὖτις ἀνερχομένῳ δόμεναι οἶκόνδε φέρεσθαι, καὶ μάλα καλὸν ἑλών· σοὶ δʼ ἄξιον ἔσται ἀμοιβῆς.
With these words she flew away like a bird into the air, but she had given Telemakhos courage, and had made him think more than ever about his father. He felt the change, wondered at it, and knew that the stranger had been a god, so he went straight to where the suitors were sitting.	ἡ μὲν ἄρʼ ὣς εἰποῦσʼ ἀπέβη γλαυκῶπις Ἀθήνη, ὄρνις δʼ ὣς ἀνόπαια διέπτατο· τῷ δʼ ἐνὶ θυμῷ θῆκε μένος καὶ θάρσος, ὑπέμνησέν τέ ἑ πατρὸς μᾶλλον ἔτʼ ἢ τὸ πάροιθεν. ὁ δὲ φρεσὶν ᾗσι νοήσας θάμβησεν κατὰ θυμόν· ὀίσατο γὰρ θεὸν εἶναι. αὐτίκα δὲ μνηστῆρας ἐπῴχετο ἰσόθεος φώς.
Phemios was still singing, and his hearers sat rapt in silence as he told the baneful tale of the homecoming   from Troy , and the ills Athena had laid upon the Achaeans. Penelope, daughter of Ikarios, heard his song from her room upstairs, and came down by the great staircase, not alone, but attended by two of her handmaids. When she reached the suitors she stood by one of the bearing posts that supported the roof of the cloisters with a staid maiden on either side of her. She held a veil, moreover, before her face, and was weeping bitterly.	τοῖσι δʼ ἀοιδὸς ἄειδε περικλυτός, οἱ δὲ σιωπῇ ἥατʼ ἀκούοντες· ὁ δʼ Ἀχαιῶν νόστον ἄειδε λυγρόν, ὃν ἐκ Τροίης ἐπετείλατο Παλλὰς Ἀθήνη. τοῦ δʼ ὑπερωιόθεν φρεσὶ σύνθετο θέσπιν ἀοιδὴν κούρη Ἰκαρίοιο, περίφρων Πηνελόπεια· κλίμακα δʼ ὑψηλὴν κατεβήσετο οἷο δόμοιο, οὐκ οἴη, ἅμα τῇ γε καὶ ἀμφίπολοι δύʼ ἕποντο. ἡ δʼ ὅτε δὴ μνηστῆρας ἀφίκετο δῖα γυναικῶν, στῆ ῥα παρὰ σταθμὸν τέγεος πύκα ποιητοῖο, ἄντα παρειάων σχομένη λιπαρὰ κρήδεμνα· ἀμφίπολος δʼ ἄρα οἱ κεδνὴ ἑκάτερθε παρέστη. δακρύσασα δʼ ἔπειτα προσηύδα θεῖον ἀοιδόν·
"""Phemios,"" she cried, ""you know many another feat of gods and heroes, such as poets love to celebrate. Sing the suitors some one of these, and let them drink their wine in silence, but cease this sad tale, for it breaks my sorrowful heart, and reminds me of my lost husband for whom I have grief   ever without ceasing, and whose name   was great over all Hellas and middle Argos ."""

"""Mother,"" answered Telemakhos, ""let the bard sing what he has a mind   to; bards are not responsible   for the ills they sing of; it is Zeus, not they, who is responsible  , and who sends weal or woe upon humankind according to his own good pleasure. There should be no feeling of against this one for singing the ill-fated return of the Danaans, for people always favor most warmly the of the latest songs. Make up your mind to it and bear it; Odysseus is not the only man who never came back from Troy , but many another went down as well as he. Go, then, within the house and busy yourself with your daily duties, your loom, your distaff, and the ordering of your servants; for speech is man's matter, and mine above all others - for it is I who am master here."""	τὴν δʼ αὖ Τηλέμαχος πεπνυμένος ἀντίον ηὔδα· μῆτερ ἐμή, τί τʼ ἄρα φθονέεις ἐρίηρον ἀοιδὸν τέρπειν ὅππῃ οἱ νόος ὄρνυται; οὔ νύ τʼ ἀοιδοὶ αἴτιοι, ἀλλά ποθι Ζεὺς αἴτιος, ὅς τε δίδωσιν ἀνδράσιν ἀλφηστῇσιν, ὅπως ἐθέλῃσιν, ἑκάστῳ. τούτῳ δʼ οὐ νέμεσις Δαναῶν κακὸν οἶτον ἀείδειν· τὴν γὰρ ἀοιδὴν μᾶλλον ἐπικλείουσʼ ἄνθρωποι, ἥ τις ἀκουόντεσσι νεωτάτη ἀμφιπέληται. σοὶ δʼ ἐπιτολμάτω κραδίη καὶ θυμὸς ἀκούειν· οὐ γὰρ Ὀδυσσεὺς οἶος ἀπώλεσε νόστιμον ἦμαρ ἐν Τροίῃ, πολλοὶ δὲ καὶ ἄλλοι φῶτες ὄλοντο. ἀλλʼ εἰς οἶκον ἰοῦσα τὰ σʼ αὐτῆς ἔργα κόμιζε, ἱστόν τʼ ἠλακάτην τε, καὶ ἀμφιπόλοισι κέλευε ἔργον ἐποίχεσθαι· μῦθος δʼ ἄνδρεσσι μελήσει πᾶσι, μάλιστα δʼ ἐμοί· τοῦ γὰρ κράτος ἔστʼ ἐνὶ οἴκῳ.
She went wondering back into the house, and laid her son's saying in her heart. Then, going upstairs with her handmaids into her room, she mourned her dear husband till Athena shed sweet sleep over her eyes. But the suitors were clamorous throughout the covered cloisters, and prayed each one that he might be her bed fellow.	ἡ μὲν θαμβήσασα πάλιν οἶκόνδε βεβήκει· παιδὸς γὰρ μῦθον πεπνυμένον ἔνθετο θυμῷ. ἐς δʼ ὑπερῷʼ ἀναβᾶσα σὺν ἀμφιπόλοισι γυναιξὶ κλαῖεν ἔπειτʼ Ὀδυσῆα φίλον πόσιν, ὄφρα οἱ ὕπνον ἡδὺν ἐπὶ βλεφάροισι βάλε γλαυκῶπις Ἀθήνη. μνηστῆρες δʼ ὁμάδησαν ἀνὰ μέγαρα σκιόεντα, πάντες δʼ ἠρήσαντο παραὶ λεχέεσσι κλιθῆναι. τοῖσι δὲ Τηλέμαχος πεπνυμένος ἤρχετο μύθων·
"Then Telemakhos spoke, ""You suitors of my mother,"" he cried, ""you with your overweening , let us feast at our pleasure now, and let there be no brawling, for it is a rare thing to hear a man with such a divine voice as Phemios has; but in the morning meet me in full assembly that I may give you formal notice to depart, and feast at one another's houses, turn and turn about, at your own cost. If on the other hand you choose to persist in sponging upon one man, heaven help me, but Zeus shall reckon with you in full, and when you fall in my father's house there shall be no man to avenge you."""	μητρὸς ἐμῆς μνηστῆρες ὑπέρβιον ὕβριν ἔχοντες, νῦν μὲν δαινύμενοι τερπώμεθα, μηδὲ βοητὺς ἔστω, ἐπεὶ τόδε καλὸν ἀκουέμεν ἐστὶν ἀοιδοῦ τοιοῦδʼ οἷος ὅδʼ ἐστί, θεοῖς ἐναλίγκιος αὐδήν. ἠῶθεν δʼ ἀγορήνδε καθεζώμεσθα κιόντες πάντες, ἵνʼ ὕμιν μῦθον ἀπηλεγέως ἀποείπω, ἐξιέναι μεγάρων· ἄλλας δʼ ἀλεγύνετε δαῖτας, ὑμὰ κτήματʼ ἔδοντες, ἀμειβόμενοι κατὰ οἴκους. εἰ δʼ ὕμιν δοκέει τόδε λωίτερον καὶ ἄμεινον ἔμμεναι, ἀνδρὸς ἑνὸς βίοτον νήποινον ὀλέσθαι, κείρετʼ· ἐγὼ δὲ θεοὺς ἐπιβώσομαι αἰὲν ἐόντας, αἴ κέ ποθι Ζεὺς δῷσι παλίντιτα ἔργα γενέσθαι· νήποινοί κεν ἔπειτα δόμων ἔντοσθεν ὄλοισθε.
"The suitors bit their lips as they heard him, and marveled at the boldness of his speech. Then, Antinoos, son of Eupeithes, said, ""The gods seem to have given you lessons in bluster and tall talking; may Zeus never grant you to be chief in Ithaca as your father was before you."""	ὣς ἔφαθʼ, οἱ δʼ ἄρα πάντες ὀδὰξ ἐν χείλεσι φύντες Τηλέμαχον θαύμαζον, ὃ θαρσαλέως ἀγόρευεν. τὸν δʼ αὖτʼ Ἀντίνοος προσέφη, Εὐπείθεος υἱός· Τηλέμαχʼ, ἦ μάλα δή σε διδάσκουσιν θεοὶ αὐτοὶ ὑψαγόρην τʼ ἔμεναι καὶ θαρσαλέως ἀγορεύειν· μὴ σέ γʼ ἐν ἀμφιάλῳ Ἰθάκῃ βασιλῆα Κρονίων ποιήσειεν, ὅ τοι γενεῇ πατρώιόν ἐστιν.
"Telemakhos answered, ""Antinoos, do not chide with me, but, god willing, I will be chief too if I can. Is this the worst fate you can think of for me? It is no bad thing to be a chief, for it brings both riches and honor. Still, now that Odysseus is dead there are many great men in Ithaca both old and young, and some other may take the lead among them; nevertheless I will be chief in my own house, and will rule those whom Odysseus has won for me."""	τὸν δʼ αὖ Τηλέμαχος πεπνυμένος ἀντίον ηὔδα· Ἀντίνοʼ, ἦ καί μοι νεμεσήσεαι ὅττι κεν εἴπω; καί κεν τοῦτʼ ἐθέλοιμι Διός γε διδόντος ἀρέσθαι. ἦ φῂς τοῦτο κάκιστον ἐν ἀνθρώποισι τετύχθαι; οὐ μὲν γάρ τι κακὸν βασιλευέμεν· αἶψά τέ οἱ δῶ ἀφνειὸν πέλεται καὶ τιμηέστερος αὐτός. ἀλλʼ ἦ τοι βασιλῆες Ἀχαιῶν εἰσὶ καὶ ἄλλοι πολλοὶ ἐν ἀμφιάλῳ Ἰθάκῃ, νέοι ἠδὲ παλαιοί, τῶν κέν τις τόδʼ ἔχῃσιν, ἐπεὶ θάνε δῖος Ὀδυσσεύς· αὐτὰρ ἐγὼν οἴκοιο ἄναξ ἔσομʼ ἡμετέροιο καὶ δμώων, οὕς μοι ληίσσατο δῖος Ὀδυσσεύς.
"Then Eurymakhos, son of Polybos, answered, ""It rests with heaven to decide who shall be chief among us, but you shall be master in your own house and over your own possessions; no one while there is a man in Ithaca shall do you violence   nor rob you. And now, my good man, I want to know about this stranger. What country does he come from? Of what family is he, and where is his estate? Has he brought you news about the return of your father, or was he on business of his own? He seemed a well-to-do man, but he hurried off so suddenly that he was gone in a moment before we could get to know him."""	τὸν δʼ αὖτʼ Εὐρύμαχος Πολύβου πάϊς ἀντίον ηὔδα· Τηλέμαχʼ, ἦ τοι ταῦτα θεῶν ἐν γούνασι κεῖται, ὅς τις ἐν ἀμφιάλῳ Ἰθάκῃ βασιλεύσει Ἀχαιῶν· κτήματα δʼ αὐτὸς ἔχοις καὶ δώμασιν οἷσιν ἀνάσσοις. μὴ γὰρ ὅ γʼ ἔλθοι ἀνὴρ ὅς τίς σʼ ἀέκοντα βίηφιν κτήματʼ ἀπορραίσει, Ἰθάκης ἔτι ναιετοώσης. ἀλλʼ ἐθέλω σε, φέριστε, περὶ ξείνοιο ἐρέσθαι, ὁππόθεν οὗτος ἀνήρ, ποίης δʼ ἐξ εὔχεται εἶναι γαίης, ποῦ δέ νύ οἱ γενεὴ καὶ πατρὶς ἄρουρα. ἠέ τινʼ ἀγγελίην πατρὸς φέρει ἐρχομένοιο, ἦ ἑὸν αὐτοῦ χρεῖος ἐελδόμενος τόδʼ ἱκάνει; οἷον ἀναΐξας ἄφαρ οἴχεται, οὐδʼ ὑπέμεινε γνώμεναι· οὐ μὲν γάρ τι κακῷ εἰς ὦπα ἐῴκει.
"""The of my father is dead and gone,"" answered Telemakhos, ""and even if some rumor reaches me I put no more faith in it now. My mother does indeed sometimes send for a soothsayer and question him, but I give his prophesying no heed. As for the stranger, he was Mentes, son of Anchialos, chief of the Taphians, an old friend of my father's."" But in his heart he knew that it had been the goddess."	τὸν δʼ αὖ Τηλέμαχος πεπνυμένος ἀντίον ηὔδα· Εὐρύμαχʼ, ἦ τοι νόστος ἀπώλετο πατρὸς ἐμοῖο· οὔτʼ οὖν ἀγγελίῃ ἔτι πείθομαι, εἴ ποθεν ἔλθοι, οὔτε θεοπροπίης ἐμπάζομαι, ἥν τινα μήτηρ ἐς μέγαρον καλέσασα θεοπρόπον ἐξερέηται. ξεῖνος δʼ οὗτος ἐμὸς πατρώιος ἐκ Τάφου ἐστίν, Μέντης δʼ Ἀγχιάλοιο δαΐφρονος εὔχεται εἶναι υἱός, ἀτὰρ Ταφίοισι φιληρέτμοισιν ἀνάσσει. ὣς φάτο Τηλέμαχος, φρεσὶ δʼ ἀθανάτην θεὸν ἔγνω.
The suitors then returned to their singing and dancing until the evening; but when night fell upon their pleasuring they went home to bed each in his own abode. Telemakhos' room was high up in a tower that looked on to the outer court; there, then, he went, brooding and full of thought. A good old woman, Eurykleia, daughter of Ops, the son of Pisenor, went before him with a couple of blazing torches. Laertes had bought her with his own wealth when she was quite young; he gave the worth of twenty oxen for her, and showed as much respect to her in his household as he did to his own wedded wife, but he did not take her to his bed for he feared his wife's resentment. She it was who now lighted Telemakhos to his room, and she loved him better than any of the other women in the house did, for she had nursed him when he was a baby. He opened the door of his bed room and sat down upon the bed; as he took off his shirt he gave it to the good old woman, who folded it tidily up, and hung it for him over a peg by his bed side, after which she went out, pulled the door to by a silver catch, and drew the bolt home by means of the strap. But Telemakhos as he lay covered with a woolen fleece kept thinking all night through of his intended voyage and of the counsel that Athena had given him	οἱ δʼ εἰς ὀρχηστύν τε καὶ ἱμερόεσσαν ἀοιδὴν τρεψάμενοι τέρποντο, μένον δʼ ἐπὶ ἕσπερον ἐλθεῖν. τοῖσι δὲ τερπομένοισι μέλας ἐπὶ ἕσπερος ἦλθε· δὴ τότε κακκείοντες ἔβαν οἶκόνδε ἕκαστος.

Now when the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared, Telemakhos rose and dressed himself. He bound his sandals on to his comely feet, girded his sword about his shoulder, and left his room looking like an immortal god. He at once sent the criers round to call the people in assembly, so they called them and the people gathered thereon; then, when they were got together, he went to the place of assembly spear in hand - not alone, for his two hounds went with him. Athena endowed him with a presence of such divine comeliness   that all marveled at him as he went by, and when he took his place in his father's seat even the oldest councilors made way for him.	ἦμος δʼ ἠριγένεια φάνη ῥοδοδάκτυλος Ἠώς, ὤρνυτʼ ἄρʼ ἐξ εὐνῆφιν Ὀδυσσῆος φίλος υἱὸς εἵματα ἑσσάμενος, περὶ δὲ ξίφος ὀξὺ θέτʼ ὤμῳ, ποσσὶ δʼ ὑπὸ λιπαροῖσιν ἐδήσατο καλὰ πέδιλα, βῆ δʼ ἴμεν ἐκ θαλάμοιο θεῷ ἐναλίγκιος ἄντην. αἶψα δὲ κηρύκεσσι λιγυφθόγγοισι κέλευσε κηρύσσειν ἀγορήνδε κάρη κομόωντας Ἀχαιούς. οἱ μὲν ἐκήρυσσον, τοὶ δʼ ἠγείροντο μάλʼ ὦκα. αὐτὰρ ἐπεί ῥʼ ἤγερθεν ὁμηγερέες τʼ ἐγένοντο, βῆ ῥʼ ἴμεν εἰς ἀγορήν, παλάμῃ δʼ ἔχε χάλκεον ἔγχος, οὐκ οἶος, ἅμα τῷ γε δύω κύνες ἀργοὶ ἕποντο. θεσπεσίην δʼ ἄρα τῷ γε χάριν κατέχευεν Ἀθήνη. τὸν δʼ ἄρα πάντες λαοὶ ἐπερχόμενον θηεῦντο· ἕζετο δʼ ἐν πατρὸς θώκῳ, εἶξαν δὲ γέροντες.
Aigyptios, a man bent double with age, and of infinite experience, was the first to speak His son Antiphos had gone with Odysseus to Ilion , land of noble steeds, but the savage Cyclops had killed him when they were all shut up in the cave, and had cooked his last dinner for him. He had three sons left, of whom two still worked on their father's land, while the third, Eurynomos, was one of the suitors; nevertheless their father could not get over the loss of Antiphos, and was still weeping for him when he began his speech.	τοῖσι δʼ ἔπειθʼ ἥρως Αἰγύπτιος ἦρχʼ ἀγορεύειν, ὃς δὴ γήραϊ κυφὸς ἔην καὶ μυρία ᾔδη. καὶ γὰρ τοῦ φίλος υἱὸς ἅμʼ ἀντιθέῳ Ὀδυσῆι Ἴλιον εἰς ἐύπωλον ἔβη κοίλῃς ἐνὶ νηυσίν, Ἄντιφος αἰχμητής· τὸν δʼ ἄγριος ἔκτανε Κύκλωψ ἐν σπῆι γλαφυρῷ, πύματον δʼ ὡπλίσσατο δόρπον. τρεῖς δέ οἱ ἄλλοι ἔσαν, καὶ ὁ μὲν μνηστῆρσιν ὁμίλει, Εὐρύνομος, δύο δʼ αἰὲν ἔχον πατρώια ἔργα. ἀλλʼ οὐδʼ ὣς τοῦ λήθετʼ ὀδυρόμενος καὶ ἀχεύων. τοῦ ὅ γε δάκρυ χέων ἀγορήσατο καὶ μετέειπε·
"""Men of Ithaca ,"" he said, ""hear my words. From the day Odysseus left us there has been no meeting of our councilors until now; who then can it be, whether old or young, that finds it so necessary to convene us? Has he got wind of some host approaching, and does he wish to warn us, or would he speak upon some other matter of public moment? I am sure he is an excellent person, and I hope Zeus will grant him his heart's desire."""	κέκλυτε δὴ νῦν μευ, Ἰθακήσιοι, ὅττι κεν εἴπω· οὔτε ποθʼ ἡμετέρη ἀγορὴ γένετʼ οὔτε θόωκος ἐξ οὗ Ὀδυσσεὺς δῖος ἔβη κοίλῃς ἐνὶ νηυσί. νῦν δὲ τίς ὧδʼ ἤγειρε; τίνα χρειὼ τόσον ἵκει ἠὲ νέων ἀνδρῶν ἢ οἳ προγενέστεροί εἰσιν; ἠέ τινʼ ἀγγελίην στρατοῦ ἔκλυεν ἐρχομένοιο, ἥν χʼ ἡμῖν σάφα εἴποι, ὅτε πρότερός γε πύθοιτο; ἦέ τι δήμιον ἄλλο πιφαύσκεται ἠδʼ ἀγορεύει; ἐσθλός μοι δοκεῖ εἶναι, ὀνήμενος. εἴθε οἱ αὐτῷ Ζεὺς ἀγαθὸν τελέσειεν, ὅτι φρεσὶν ᾗσι μενοινᾷ.
"Telemakhos took this speech as of good omen and rose at once, for he was bursting with what he had to say. He stood in the middle of the assembly and the good herald Pisenor brought him his staff. Then, turning to Aigyptios, ""Sir,"" said he, ""it is I, as you will shortly learn, who have convened you, for it is I who am the most aggrieved. I have not got wind of any host approaching about which I would warn you, nor is there any matter of public moment on which I would speak. My grievance is purely personal, and turns on two great misfortunes which have fallen upon my house. The first of these is the loss of my excellent father, who was chief among all you here present, and was like a father to every one of you; the second is much more serious, and ere long will be the utter ruin of my estate. The sons of all the chief men among you are pestering my mother to marry them against her will. They are afraid to go to her father Ikarios, asking him to choose the one he likes best, and to provide marriage gifts for his daughter, but day by day they keep hanging about my father's house, sacrificing our oxen, sheep, and fat goats for their banquets, and never giving so much as a thought to the quantity of wine they drink. No estate can stand such recklessness; we have now no Odysseus to ward off harm from our doors, and I cannot hold my own against them. I shall never all my days be as good a man as he was, still I would indeed defend myself if I had power to do so, for I cannot stand such treatment any longer; my house is being disgraced and ruined. Have respect, therefore, to your own consciences and to public opinion. Fear, too, the wrath   of the gods, lest they should be displeased and turn upon you. I pray you by Zeus and Themis, who is the beginning and the end of councils, do not hold back, my friends, and leave me singlehanded - unless it be that my brave father Odysseus did some wrong to the Achaeans which you would now avenge on me, by aiding and abetting these suitors. Moreover, if I am to be eaten out of house and home at all, I had rather you did the eating yourselves, for I could then take action against you to some purpose, and serve you with notices from house to house till I got paid in full, whereas now I have no remedy."""	ὣς φάτο, χαῖρε δὲ φήμῃ Ὀδυσσῆος φίλος υἱός, οὐδʼ ἄρʼ ἔτι δὴν ἧστο, μενοίνησεν δʼ ἀγορεύειν, στῆ δὲ μέσῃ ἀγορῇ· σκῆπτρον δέ οἱ ἔμβαλε χειρὶ κῆρυξ Πεισήνωρ πεπνυμένα μήδεα εἰδώς. πρῶτον ἔπειτα γέροντα καθαπτόμενος προσέειπεν· ὦ γέρον, οὐχ ἑκὰς οὗτος ἀνήρ, τάχα δʼ εἴσεαι αὐτός, ὃς λαὸν ἤγειρα· μάλιστα δέ μʼ ἄλγος ἱκάνει. οὔτε τινʼ ἀγγελίην στρατοῦ ἔκλυον ἐρχομένοιο, ἥν χʼ ὑμῖν σάφα εἴπω, ὅτε πρότερός γε πυθοίμην, οὔτε τι δήμιον ἄλλο πιφαύσκομαι οὐδʼ ἀγορεύω, ἀλλʼ ἐμὸν αὐτοῦ χρεῖος, ὅ μοι κακὰ ἔμπεσεν οἴκῳ δοιά· τὸ μὲν πατέρʼ ἐσθλὸν ἀπώλεσα, ὅς ποτʼ ἐν ὑμῖν τοίσδεσσιν βασίλευε, πατὴρ δʼ ὣς ἤπιος ἦεν· νῦν δʼ αὖ καὶ πολὺ μεῖζον, ὃ δὴ τάχα οἶκον ἅπαντα πάγχυ διαρραίσει, βίοτον δʼ ἀπὸ πάμπαν ὀλέσσει. μητέρι μοι μνηστῆρες ἐπέχραον οὐκ ἐθελούσῃ, τῶν ἀνδρῶν φίλοι υἷες, οἳ ἐνθάδε γʼ εἰσὶν ἄριστοι, οἳ πατρὸς μὲν ἐς οἶκον ἀπερρίγασι νέεσθαι Ἰκαρίου, ὥς κʼ αὐτὸς ἐεδνώσαιτο θύγατρα, δοίη δʼ ᾧ κʼ ἐθέλοι καί οἱ κεχαρισμένος ἔλθοι· οἱ δʼ εἰς ἡμέτερον πωλεύμενοι ἤματα πάντα, βοῦς ἱερεύοντες καὶ ὄις καὶ πίονας αἶγας εἰλαπινάζουσιν πίνουσί τε αἴθοπα οἶνον μαψιδίως· τὰ δὲ πολλὰ κατάνεται. οὐ γὰρ ἔπʼ ἀνήρ, οἷος Ὀδυσσεὺς ἔσκεν, ἀρὴν ἀπὸ οἴκου ἀμῦναι. ἡμεῖς δʼ οὔ νύ τι τοῖοι ἀμυνέμεν· ἦ καὶ ἔπειτα λευγαλέοι τʼ ἐσόμεσθα καὶ οὐ δεδαηκότες ἀλκήν. ἦ τʼ ἂν ἀμυναίμην, εἴ μοι δύναμίς γε παρείη. οὐ γὰρ ἔτʼ ἀνσχετὰ ἔργα τετεύχαται, οὐδʼ ἔτι καλῶς οἶκος ἐμὸς διόλωλε. νεμεσσήθητε καὶ αὐτοί, ἄλλους τʼ αἰδέσθητε περικτίονας ἀνθρώπους, οἳ περιναιετάουσι· θεῶν δʼ ὑποδείσατε μῆνιν, μή τι μεταστρέψωσιν ἀγασσάμενοι κακὰ ἔργα. λίσσομαι ἠμὲν Ζηνὸς Ὀλυμπίου ἠδὲ Θέμιστος, ἥ τʼ ἀνδρῶν ἀγορὰς ἠμὲν λύει ἠδὲ καθίζει· σχέσθε, φίλοι, καί μʼ οἶον ἐάσατε πένθεϊ λυγρῷ τείρεσθʼ, εἰ μή πού τι πατὴρ ἐμὸς ἐσθλὸς Ὀδυσσεὺς δυσμενέων κάκʼ ἔρεξεν ἐυκνήμιδας Ἀχαιούς, τῶν μʼ ἀποτινύμενοι κακὰ ῥέζετε δυσμενέοντες, τούτους ὀτρύνοντες. ἐμοὶ δέ κε κέρδιον εἴη ὑμέας ἐσθέμεναι κειμήλιά τε πρόβασίν τε. εἴ χʼ ὑμεῖς γε φάγοιτε, τάχʼ ἄν ποτε καὶ τίσις εἴη· τόφρα γὰρ ἂν κατὰ ἄστυ ποτιπτυσσοίμεθα μύθῳ χρήματʼ ἀπαιτίζοντες, ἕως κʼ ἀπὸ πάντα δοθείη· νῦν δέ μοι ἀπρήκτους ὀδύνας ἐμβάλλετε θυμῷ.
With this Telemakhos dashed his staff to the ground and burst into tears. Every one was very sorry for him, but they all sat still and no one ventured to make him an angry answer, save only Antinoos, who spoke thus:	ὣς φάτο χωόμενος, ποτὶ δὲ σκῆπτρον βάλε γαίῃ δάκρυʼ ἀναπρήσας· οἶκτος δʼ ἕλε λαὸν ἅπαντα. ἔνθʼ ἄλλοι μὲν πάντες ἀκὴν ἔσαν, οὐδέ τις ἔτλη Τηλέμαχον μύθοισιν ἀμείψασθαι χαλεποῖσιν· Ἀντίνοος δέ μιν οἶος ἀμειβόμενος προσέειπε·
"""Telemakhos, insolent braggart that you are, how dare you try to throw the blame upon us suitors? We are not the ones who are responsible   but your mother is, for she knows many kinds of . This three years past, and close on four, she has been driving us out of our minds, by encouraging each one of us, and sending him messages that say one thing but her means other things. And then there was that other trick she played us. She set up a great tambour frame in her room, and began to work on an enormous piece of fine fabric. ‘Sweet hearts,’ said she, ‘Odysseus is indeed dead, still do not press me to marry again immediately, wait - for I would not have skill in weaving perish unrecorded - till I have completed a shroud for the hero Laertes , to be in readiness against the time when death shall take him. He is very rich, and the women of the will talk if he is laid out without a shroud.’"	Τηλέμαχʼ ὑψαγόρη, μένος ἄσχετε, ποῖον ἔειπες ἡμέας αἰσχύνων· ἐθέλοις δέ κε μῶμον ἀνάψαι. σοὶ δʼ οὔ τι μνηστῆρες Ἀχαιῶν αἴτιοί εἰσιν, ἀλλὰ φίλη μήτηρ, ἥ τοι πέρι κέρδεα οἶδεν. ἤδη γὰρ τρίτον ἐστὶν ἔτος, τάχα δʼ εἶσι τέταρτον, ἐξ οὗ ἀτέμβει θυμὸν ἐνὶ στήθεσσιν Ἀχαιῶν. πάντας μέν ῥʼ ἔλπει καὶ ὑπίσχεται ἀνδρὶ ἑκάστῳ ἀγγελίας προϊεῖσα, νόος δέ οἱ ἄλλα μενοινᾷ. ἡ δὲ δόλον τόνδʼ ἄλλον ἐνὶ φρεσὶ μερμήριξε· στησαμένη μέγαν ἱστὸν ἐνὶ μεγάροισιν ὕφαινε, λεπτὸν καὶ περίμετρον· ἄφαρ δʼ ἡμῖν μετέειπε· κοῦροι ἐμοὶ μνηστῆρες, ἐπεὶ θάνε δῖος Ὀδυσσεύς, μίμνετʼ ἐπειγόμενοι τὸν ἐμὸν γάμον, εἰς ὅ κε φᾶρος ἐκτελέσω, μή μοι μεταμώνια νήματʼ ὄληται, Λαέρτῃ ἥρωι ταφήιον, εἰς ὅτε κέν μιν μοῖρʼ ὀλοὴ καθέλῃσι τανηλεγέος θανάτοιο, μή τίς μοι κατὰ δῆμον Ἀχαιϊάδων νεμεσήσῃ. αἴ κεν ἄτερ σπείρου κεῖται πολλὰ κτεατίσσας.
"""This was what she said, and we assented; whereon we could see her working on her great web all day long, but at night she would unpick the stitches again by torchlight. She fooled us in this way for three years and we never found her out, but as time   wore on and she was now in her fourth year, one of her maids who knew what she was doing told us, and we caught her in the act of undoing her work, so she had to finish it whether she would or no. The suitors, therefore, make you this answer, that both you and the Achaeans may understand - ‘Send your mother away, and bid her marry the man of her own and of her father's choice’; for I do not know what will happen if she goes on plaguing us much longer with the airs she gives herself on the score of the accomplishments Athena has taught her, and because she knows so many kinds of . We never yet heard of such a woman; we know all about Tyro, Alkmene, Mycene, and the famous women of old, but they were nothing to your mother, any one of them. It was not fair of her to treat us in that way, and as long as she continues in the mind   with which heaven has now endowed her, so long shall we go on eating up your estate; and I do not see why she should change, for she gets all the honor and glory  , and it is you who pay for it, not she. Understand, then, that we will not go back to our lands, neither here nor elsewhere, till she has made her choice and married some one or other of us."""	ὣς ἔφαθʼ, ἡμῖν δʼ αὖτʼ ἐπεπείθετο θυμὸς ἀγήνωρ. ἔνθα καὶ ἠματίη μὲν ὑφαίνεσκεν μέγαν ἱστόν, νύκτας δʼ ἀλλύεσκεν, ἐπεὶ δαΐδας παραθεῖτο. ὣς τρίετες μὲν ἔληθε δόλῳ καὶ ἔπειθεν Ἀχαιούς· ἀλλʼ ὅτε τέτρατον ἦλθεν ἔτος καὶ ἐπήλυθον ὧραι, καὶ τότε δή τις ἔειπε γυναικῶν, ἣ σάφα ᾔδη, καὶ τήν γʼ ἀλλύουσαν ἐφεύρομεν ἀγλαὸν ἱστόν. ὣς τὸ μὲν ἐξετέλεσσε καὶ οὐκ ἐθέλουσʼ ὑπʼ ἀνάγκης· σοὶ δʼ ὧδε μνηστῆρες ὑποκρίνονται, ἵνʼ εἰδῇς αὐτὸς σῷ θυμῷ, εἰδῶσι δὲ πάντες Ἀχαιοί· μητέρα σὴν ἀπόπεμψον, ἄνωχθι δέ μιν γαμέεσθαι τῷ ὅτεῴ τε πατὴρ κέλεται καὶ ἁνδάνει αὐτῇ. εἰ δʼ ἔτʼ ἀνιήσει γε πολὺν χρόνον υἷας Ἀχαιῶν, τὰ φρονέουσʼ ἀνὰ θυμόν, ὅ οἱ πέρι δῶκεν Ἀθήνη ἔργα τʼ ἐπίστασθαι περικαλλέα καὶ φρένας ἐσθλὰς κέρδεά θʼ, οἷʼ οὔ πώ τινʼ ἀκούομεν οὐδὲ παλαιῶν, τάων αἳ πάρος ἦσαν ἐυπλοκαμῖδες Ἀχαιαί, Τυρώ τʼ Ἀλκμήνη τε ἐυστέφανός τε Μυκήνη· τάων οὔ τις ὁμοῖα νοήματα Πηνελοπείῃ ᾔδη· ἀτὰρ μὲν τοῦτό γʼ ἐναίσιμον οὐκ ἐνόησε. τόφρα γὰρ οὖν βίοτόν τε τεὸν καὶ κτήματʼ ἔδονται, ὄφρα κε κείνη τοῦτον ἔχῃ νόον, ὅν τινά οἱ νῦν ἐν στήθεσσι τιθεῖσι θεοί. μέγα μὲν κλέος αὐτῇ ποιεῖτʼ, αὐτὰρ σοί γε ποθὴν πολέος βιότοιο. ἡμεῖς δʼ οὔτʼ ἐπὶ ἔργα πάρος γʼ ἴμεν οὔτε πῃ ἄλλῃ, πρίν γʼ αὐτὴν γήμασθαι Ἀχαιῶν ᾧ κʼ ἐθέλῃσι.
"Telemakhos answered, ""Antinoos, how can I drive the mother who bore me from my father's house? My father is abroad and we do not know whether he is alive or dead. It will be hard on me if I have to pay Ikarios the large sum which I must give him if I insist on sending his daughter back to him. Not only will he deal rigorously with me, but some will also punish me; for my mother when she leaves the house will call on the Erinyes to avenge her; besides, it will result in for me among men, and I will have nothing to say to it. If you choose to take offense at this, leave the house and feast elsewhere at one another's houses at your own cost turn and turn about. If, on the other hand, you elect to persist in sponging upon one man, heaven help me, but Zeus shall reckon with you in full, and when you fall in my father's house there shall be no man to avenge you."""	τὸν δʼ αὖ Τηλέμαχος πεπνυμένος ἀντίον ηὔδα· Ἀντίνοʼ, οὔ πως ἔστι δόμων ἀέκουσαν ἀπῶσαι ἥ μʼ ἔτεχʼ, ἥ μʼ ἔθρεψε· πατὴρ δʼ ἐμὸς ἄλλοθι γαίης, ζώει ὅ γʼ ἦ τέθνηκε· κακὸν δέ με πόλλʼ ἀποτίνειν Ἰκαρίῳ, αἴ κʼ αὐτὸς ἑκὼν ἀπὸ μητέρα πέμψω. ἐκ γὰρ τοῦ πατρὸς κακὰ πείσομαι, ἄλλα δὲ δαίμων δώσει, ἐπεὶ μήτηρ στυγερὰς ἀρήσετʼ ἐρινῦς οἴκου ἀπερχομένη· νέμεσις δέ μοι ἐξ ἀνθρώπων ἔσσεται· ὣς οὐ τοῦτον ἐγώ ποτε μῦθον ἐνίψω. ὑμέτερος δʼ εἰ μὲν θυμὸς νεμεσίζεται αὐτῶν, ἔξιτέ μοι μεγάρων, ἄλλας δʼ ἀλεγύνετε δαῖτας ὑμὰ κτήματʼ ἔδοντες ἀμειβόμενοι κατὰ οἴκους. εἰ δʼ ὑμῖν δοκέει τόδε λωίτερον καὶ ἄμεινον ἔμμεναι, ἀνδρὸς ἑνὸς βίοτον νήποινον ὀλέσθαι, κείρετʼ· ἐγὼ δὲ θεοὺς ἐπιβώσομαι αἰὲν ἐόντας, αἴ κέ ποθι Ζεὺς δῷσι παλίντιτα ἔργα γενέσθαι. νήποινοί κεν ἔπειτα δόμων ἔντοσθεν ὄλοισθε.
As he spoke Zeus sent two eagles from the top of the mountain, and they flew on and on with the wind, sailing side by side in their own lordly flight. When they were right over the middle of the assembly they wheeled and circled about, beating the air with their wings and glaring death into the eyes of them that were below; then, fighting fiercely and tearing at one another, they flew off towards the right over the town. The people wondered as they saw them, and asked each other what an this might be; whereon Halitherses, who was the best seer and reader of omens among them, spoke to them plainly and in all honesty, saying:	ὣς φάτο Τηλέμαχος, τῷ δʼ αἰετὼ εὐρύοπα Ζεὺς ὑψόθεν ἐκ κορυφῆς ὄρεος προέηκε πέτεσθαι. τὼ δʼ ἕως μέν ῥʼ ἐπέτοντο μετὰ πνοιῇς ἀνέμοιο πλησίω ἀλλήλοισι τιταινομένω πτερύγεσσιν· ἀλλʼ ὅτε δὴ μέσσην ἀγορὴν πολύφημον ἱκέσθην, ἔνθʼ ἐπιδινηθέντε τιναξάσθην πτερὰ πυκνά, ἐς δʼ ἰδέτην πάντων κεφαλάς, ὄσσοντο δʼ ὄλεθρον· δρυψαμένω δʼ ὀνύχεσσι παρειὰς ἀμφί τε δειρὰς δεξιὼ ἤιξαν διά τʼ οἰκία καὶ πόλιν αὐτῶν. θάμβησαν δʼ ὄρνιθας, ἐπεὶ ἴδον ὀφθαλμοῖσιν· ὥρμηναν δʼ ἀνὰ θυμὸν ἅ περ τελέεσθαι ἔμελλον. τοῖσι δὲ καὶ μετέειπε γέρων ἥρως Ἁλιθέρσης Μαστορίδης· ὁ γὰρ οἶος ὁμηλικίην ἐκέκαστο ὄρνιθας γνῶναι καὶ ἐναίσιμα μυθήσασθαι· ὅ σφιν ἐὺ φρονέων ἀγορήσατο καὶ μετέειπε·
"""Hear me, men of Ithaca , and I speak more particularly to the suitors, for I see mischief brewing for them. Odysseus is not going to be away much longer; indeed he is close at hand to deal out death and destruction, not on them alone, but on many another of us who live in Ithaca . Let us then be wise in time, and put a stop to this wickedness before he comes. Let the suitors do so of their own accord; it will be better for them, for I am not prophesying without due knowledge; everything has happened to Odysseus as I foretold when the Argives set out for Troy , and he with them. I said that after going through much hardship and losing all his men he should come home again in the twentieth year and that no one would know him; and now all this is coming true."""	κέκλυτε δὴ νῦν μευ, Ἰθακήσιοι, ὅττι κεν εἴπω· μνηστῆρσιν δὲ μάλιστα πιφαυσκόμενος τάδε εἴρω· τοῖσιν γὰρ μέγα πῆμα κυλίνδεται· οὐ γὰρ Ὀδυσσεὺς δὴν ἀπάνευθε φίλων ὧν ἔσσεται, ἀλλά που ἤδη ἐγγὺς ἐὼν τοῖσδεσσι φόνον καὶ κῆρα φυτεύει πάντεσσιν· πολέσιν δὲ καὶ ἄλλοισιν κακὸν ἔσται, οἳ νεμόμεσθʼ Ἰθάκην ἐυδείελον. ἀλλὰ πολὺ πρὶν φραζώμεσθʼ, ὥς κεν καταπαύσομεν· οἱ δὲ καὶ αὐτοὶ παυέσθων· καὶ γάρ σφιν ἄφαρ τόδε λώιόν ἐστιν. οὐ γὰρ ἀπείρητος μαντεύομαι, ἀλλʼ ἐὺ εἰδώς· καὶ γὰρ κείνῳ φημὶ τελευτηθῆναι ἅπαντα, ὥς οἱ ἐμυθεόμην, ὅτε Ἴλιον εἰσανέβαινον Ἀργεῖοι, μετὰ δέ σφιν ἔβη πολύμητις Ὀδυσσεύς. φῆν κακὰ πολλὰ παθόντʼ, ὀλέσαντʼ ἄπο πάντας ἑταίρους, ἄγνωστον πάντεσσιν ἐεικοστῷ ἐνιαυτῷ οἴκαδʼ ἐλεύσεσθαι· τὰ δὲ δὴ νῦν πάντα τελεῖται.
"Eurymakhos son of Polybos then said, ""Go home, old man, and prophesy to your own children, or it may be worse for them. I can read these omens myself much better than you can; birds are always flying about in the sunshine somewhere or other, but they seldom mean anything. Odysseus has died in a far country, and it is a pity you are not dead along with him, instead of prating here about omens and adding fuel to the anger of Telemakhos which is fierce enough as it is. I suppose you think he will give you something for your family, but I tell you - and it shall surely be - when an old man like you, who should know better, talks a young one over till he becomes troublesome, in the first place his young friend will only fare so much the worse - he will take nothing by it, for the suitors will prevent this - and in the next, we will lay a heavier fine, sir, upon yourself than you will at all like paying, for it will bear hardly upon you. As for Telemakhos, I warn him in the presence of you all to send his mother back to her father, who will find her a husband and provide her with all the marriage gifts so dear a daughter may expect. Till then we shall go on harassing him with our suit; for we fear no man, and care neither for him, with all his fine speeches, nor for any fortune-telling of yours. You may preach as much as you please, but we shall only hate you the more. We shall go back and continue to eat up Telemakhos' estate without paying him, till such time as his mother leaves off tormenting us by keeping us day after day on the tiptoe of expectation, each vying with the other in his suit for a prize of such rare perfection  . Besides we cannot go after the other women whom we should marry in due course, but for the way in which she treats us."""	τὸν δʼ αὖτʼ Εὐρύμαχος Πολύβου πάϊς ἀντίον ηὔδα· ὦ γέρον, εἰ δʼ ἄγε νῦν μαντεύεο σοῖσι τέκεσσιν οἴκαδʼ ἰών, μή πού τι κακὸν πάσχωσιν ὀπίσσω· ταῦτα δʼ ἐγὼ σέο πολλὸν ἀμείνων μαντεύεσθαι. ὄρνιθες δέ τε πολλοὶ ὑπʼ αὐγὰς ἠελίοιο φοιτῶσʼ, οὐδέ τε πάντες ἐναίσιμοι· αὐτὰρ Ὀδυσσεὺς ὤλετο τῆλʼ, ὡς καὶ σὺ καταφθίσθαι σὺν ἐκείνῳ ὤφελες. οὐκ ἂν τόσσα θεοπροπέων ἀγόρευες, οὐδέ κε Τηλέμαχον κεχολωμένον ὧδʼ ἀνιείης, σῷ οἴκῳ δῶρον ποτιδέγμενος, αἴ κε πόρῃσιν. ἀλλʼ ἔκ τοι ἐρέω, τὸ δὲ καὶ τετελεσμένον ἔσται· αἴ κε νεώτερον ἄνδρα παλαιά τε πολλά τε εἰδὼς παρφάμενος ἐπέεσσιν ἐποτρύνῃς χαλεπαίνειν, αὐτῷ μέν οἱ πρῶτον ἀνιηρέστερον ἔσται, πρῆξαι δʼ ἔμπης οὔ τι δυνήσεται εἵνεκα τῶνδε· σοὶ δέ, γέρον, θωὴν ἐπιθήσομεν, ἥν κʼ ἐνὶ θυμῷ τίνων ἀσχάλλῃς· χαλεπὸν δέ τοι ἔσσεται ἄλγος.

"Then Telemakhos said, ""Eurymakhos, and you other suitors, I shall say no more, and entreat you no further, for the gods and the people of Ithaca now know my story. Give me, then, a ship and a crew of twenty men to take me hither and thither, and I will go to Sparta and to Pylos to inquire about the of my father who has so long been missing. Some one may tell me something, or (and people often hear in this way) some heaven-sent message may direct me. If I can hear of him as alive and achieving his homecoming   I will put up with the waste you suitors will make for yet another twelve months. If on the other hand I hear of his death, I will return at once, celebrate his funeral rites with all due pomp, build a grave marker   to his memory, and make my mother marry again."""	τὸν δʼ αὖ Τηλέμαχος πεπνυμένος ἀντίον ηὔδα· Εὐρύμαχʼ ἠδὲ καὶ ἄλλοι, ὅσοι μνηστῆρες ἀγαυοί, ταῦτα μὲν οὐχ ὑμέας ἔτι λίσσομαι οὐδʼ ἀγορεύω· ἤδη γὰρ τὰ ἴσασι θεοὶ καὶ πάντες Ἀχαιοί. ἀλλʼ ἄγε μοι δότε νῆα θοὴν καὶ εἴκοσʼ ἑταίρους, οἵ κέ μοι ἔνθα καὶ ἔνθα διαπρήσσωσι κέλευθον. εἶμι γὰρ ἐς Σπάρτην τε καὶ ἐς Πύλον ἠμαθόεντα νόστον πευσόμενος πατρὸς δὴν οἰχομένοιο, ἤν τίς μοι εἴπῃσι βροτῶν ἢ ὄσσαν ἀκούσω ἐκ Διός, ἥ τε μάλιστα φέρει κλέος ἀνθρώποισιν· εἰ μέν κεν πατρὸς βίοτον καὶ νόστον ἀκούσω, ἦ τʼ ἄν, τρυχόμενός περ, ἔτι τλαίην ἐνιαυτόν· εἰ δέ κε τεθνηῶτος ἀκούσω μηδʼ ἔτʼ ἐόντος, νοστήσας δὴ ἔπειτα φίλην ἐς πατρίδα γαῖαν σῆμά τέ οἱ χεύω καὶ ἐπὶ κτέρεα κτερεΐξω πολλὰ μάλʼ, ὅσσα ἔοικε, καὶ ἀνέρι μητέρα δώσω.
With these words he sat down, and Mentor who had been a friend of Odysseus, and had been left in charge of everything with full authority over the servants, rose to speak. He, then, plainly and in all honesty addressed them thus:	ἦ τοι ὅ γʼ ὣς εἰπὼν κατʼ ἄρʼ ἕζετο, τοῖσι δʼ ἀνέστη Μέντωρ, ὅς ῥʼ Ὀδυσῆος ἀμύμονος ἦεν ἑταῖρος, καί οἱ ἰὼν ἐν νηυσὶν ἐπέτρεπεν οἶκον ἅπαντα, πείθεσθαί τε γέροντι καὶ ἔμπεδα πάντα φυλάσσειν· ὅ σφιν ἐὺ φρονέων ἀγορήσατο καὶ μετέειπεν·
"""Hear me, men of Ithaca , I hope that you may never have a kind and well-disposed ruler any more, nor one who will govern you equitably; I hope that all your chiefs henceforward may be cruel and unjust, for there is not one of you but has forgotten Odysseus, who ruled you as though he were your father. I am not half so angry with the suitors, for if they choose to do violence in the naughtiness of their minds  , and wager their heads that Odysseus will not return, they can take the high hand and eat up his estate, but as for you others I am shocked at the way in which you the rest of the population   all sit still without even trying to stop such scandalous goings on - which you could do if you chose, for you are many and they are few."""	κέκλυτε δὴ νῦν μευ, Ἰθακήσιοι, ὅττι κεν εἴπω· μή τις ἔτι πρόφρων ἀγανὸς καὶ ἤπιος ἔστω σκηπτοῦχος βασιλεύς, μηδὲ φρεσὶν αἴσιμα εἰδώς, ἀλλʼ αἰεὶ χαλεπός τʼ εἴη καὶ αἴσυλα ῥέζοι· ὡς οὔ τις μέμνηται Ὀδυσσῆος θείοιο λαῶν οἷσιν ἄνασσε, πατὴρ δʼ ὣς ἤπιος ἦεν. ἀλλʼ ἦ τοι μνηστῆρας ἀγήνορας οὔ τι μεγαίρω ἔρδειν ἔργα βίαια κακορραφίῃσι νόοιο· σφὰς γὰρ παρθέμενοι κεφαλὰς κατέδουσι βιαίως οἶκον Ὀδυσσῆος, τὸν δʼ οὐκέτι φασὶ νέεσθαι. νῦν δʼ ἄλλῳ δήμῳ νεμεσίζομαι, οἷον ἅπαντες ἧσθʼ ἄνεῳ, ἀτὰρ οὔ τι καθαπτόμενοι ἐπέεσσι παύρους μνηστῆρας καταπαύετε πολλοὶ ἐόντες.
"Leiokritos, son of Euenor, answered him saying, ""Mentor, what folly is all this, that you should set the people to stay us? It is a hard thing for one man to fight with many about his victuals. Even though Odysseus himself were to set upon us while we are feasting in his house, and do his best to oust us, his wife, who wants him back so very badly, would have small cause for rejoicing, and his blood would be upon his own head if he fought against such great odds. There is no sense in what you have been saying. Now, therefore, do you people go about your business, and let his father's old friends, Mentor and Halitherses, speed this boy on his journey, if he goes at all - which I do not think he will, for he is more likely to stay where he is till some one comes and tells him something."""	τὸν δʼ Εὐηνορίδης Λειώκριτος ἀντίον ηὔδα· Μέντορ ἀταρτηρέ, φρένας ἠλεέ, ποῖον ἔειπες ἡμέας ὀτρύνων καταπαυέμεν. ἀργαλέον δὲ ἀνδράσι καὶ πλεόνεσσι μαχήσασθαι περὶ δαιτί. εἴ περ γάρ κʼ Ὀδυσεὺς Ἰθακήσιος αὐτὸς ἐπελθὼν δαινυμένους κατὰ δῶμα ἑὸν μνηστῆρας ἀγαυοὺς ἐξελάσαι μεγάροιο μενοινήσειʼ ἐνὶ θυμῷ, οὔ κέν οἱ κεχάροιτο γυνή, μάλα περ χατέουσα, ἐλθόντʼ, ἀλλά κεν αὐτοῦ ἀεικέα πότμον ἐπίσποι, εἰ πλεόνεσσι μάχοιτο· σὺ δʼ οὐ κατὰ μοῖραν ἔειπες. ἀλλʼ ἄγε, λαοὶ μὲν σκίδνασθʼ ἐπὶ ἔργα ἕκαστος, τούτῳ δʼ ὀτρυνέει Μέντωρ ὁδὸν ἠδʼ Ἁλιθέρσης, οἵ τέ οἱ ἐξ ἀρχῆς πατρώιοί εἰσιν ἑταῖροι. ἀλλʼ ὀίω, καὶ δηθὰ καθήμενος ἀγγελιάων πεύσεται εἰν Ἰθάκῃ, τελέει δʼ ὁδὸν οὔ ποτε ταύτην.
On this he broke up the assembly, and every man went back to his own abode, while the suitors returned to the house of Odysseus.	ὣς ἄρʼ ἐφώνησεν, λῦσεν δʼ ἀγορὴν αἰψηρήν. οἱ μὲν ἄρʼ ἐσκίδναντο ἑὰ πρὸς δώμαθʼ ἕκαστος, μνηστῆρες δʼ ἐς δώματʼ ἴσαν θείου Ὀδυσῆος.
Then Telemakhos went all alone by the sea side, washed his hands in the gray waves, and prayed to Athena.	Τηλέμαχος δʼ ἀπάνευθε κιὼν ἐπὶ θῖνα θαλάσσης, χεῖρας νιψάμενος πολιῆς ἁλὸς εὔχετʼ Ἀθήνῃ·
"""Hear me,"" he cried, ""you god who visited me yesterday, and bade me sail the seas in search of the of my father who has so long been missing. I would obey you, but the Achaeans, and more particularly the wicked suitors, are hindering me that I cannot do so."""	κλῦθί μευ, ὃ χθιζὸς θεὸς ἤλυθες ἡμέτερον δῶ καί μʼ ἐν νηὶ κέλευσας ἐπʼ ἠεροειδέα πόντον νόστον πευσόμενον πατρὸς δὴν οἰχομένοιο ἔρχεσθαι· τὰ δὲ πάντα διατρίβουσιν Ἀχαιοί, μνηστῆρες δὲ μάλιστα κακῶς ὑπερηνορέοντες.
"As he thus prayed, Athena came close up to him in the likeness and with the voice of Mentor. ""Telemakhos,"" said she, ""if you are made of the same stuff as your father you will be neither fool nor coward henceforward, for Odysseus never broke his word nor left his work half done. If, then, you take after him, your voyage will not be fruitless, but unless you have the blood of Odysseus and of Penelope in your veins I see no likelihood of your succeeding. Sons are seldom as good men as their fathers; they are generally worse, not better; still, as you are not going to be either fool or coward henceforward, and are not entirely without some share of your father's wise discernment, I look with hope upon your undertaking. But mind you never make common cause   with any of those foolish suitors, for they are neither sensible nor just  , and give no thought to death and to the doom that will shortly fall on one and all of them, so that they shall perish on the same day. As for your voyage, it shall not be long delayed; your father was such an old friend of mine that I will find you a ship, and will come with you myself. Now, however, return home, and go about among the suitors; begin getting provisions ready for your voyage; see everything well stowed, the wine in jars, and the barley meal, which is the staff of life, in leathern bags, while I go round the and round up volunteers at once. There are many ships in Ithaca both old and new; I will run my eye over them for you and will choose the best; we will get her ready and will put out to sea without delay."""	ὣς ἔφατʼ εὐχόμενος, σχεδόθεν δέ οἱ ἦλθεν Ἀθήνη, Μέντορι εἰδομένη ἠμὲν δέμας ἠδὲ καὶ αὐδήν, καί μιν φωνήσασʼ ἔπεα πτερόεντα προσηύδα· Τηλέμαχʼ, οὐδʼ ὄπιθεν κακὸς ἔσσεαι οὐδʼ ἀνοήμων, εἰ δή τοι σοῦ πατρὸς ἐνέστακται μένος ἠύ, οἷος κεῖνος ἔην τελέσαι ἔργον τε ἔπος τε· οὔ τοι ἔπειθʼ ἁλίη ὁδὸς ἔσσεται οὐδʼ ἀτέλεστος. εἰ δʼ οὐ κείνου γʼ ἐσσὶ γόνος καὶ Πηνελοπείης, οὐ σέ γʼ ἔπειτα ἔολπα τελευτήσειν, ἃ μενοινᾷς. παῦροι γάρ τοι παῖδες ὁμοῖοι πατρὶ πέλονται, οἱ πλέονες κακίους, παῦροι δέ τε πατρὸς ἀρείους. ἀλλʼ ἐπεὶ οὐδʼ ὄπιθεν κακὸς ἔσσεαι οὐδʼ ἀνοήμων, οὐδέ σε πάγχυ γε μῆτις Ὀδυσσῆος προλέλοιπεν, ἐλπωρή τοι ἔπειτα τελευτῆσαι τάδε ἔργα. τῶ νῦν μνηστήρων μὲν ἔα βουλήν τε νόον τε ἀφραδέων, ἐπεὶ οὔ τι νοήμονες οὐδὲ δίκαιοι· οὐδέ τι ἴσασιν θάνατον καὶ κῆρα μέλαιναν, ὃς δή σφι σχεδόν ἐστιν, ἐπʼ ἤματι πάντας ὀλέσθαι. σοὶ δʼ ὁδὸς οὐκέτι δηρὸν ἀπέσσεται ἣν σὺ μενοινᾷς· τοῖος γάρ τοι ἑταῖρος ἐγὼ πατρώιός εἰμι, ὅς τοι νῆα θοὴν στελέω καὶ ἅμʼ ἕψομαι αὐτός. ἀλλὰ σὺ μὲν πρὸς δώματʼ ἰὼν μνηστῆρσιν ὁμίλει, ὅπλισσόν τʼ ἤια καὶ ἄγγεσιν ἄρσον ἅπαντα, οἶνον ἐν ἀμφιφορεῦσι, καὶ ἄλφιτα, μυελὸν ἀνδρῶν, δέρμασιν ἐν πυκινοῖσιν· ἐγὼ δʼ ἀνὰ δῆμον ἑταίρους αἶψʼ ἐθελοντῆρας συλλέξομαι. εἰσὶ δὲ νῆες πολλαὶ ἐν ἀμφιάλῳ Ἰθάκῃ, νέαι ἠδὲ παλαιαί· τάων μέν τοι ἐγὼν ἐπιόψομαι ἥ τις ἀρίστη, ὦκα δʼ ἐφοπλίσσαντες ἐνήσομεν εὐρέι πόντῳ.
"Thus spoke Athena daughter of Zeus, and Telemakhos lost no time in doing as the goddess told him. He went moodily and found the suitors flaying goats and singeing pigs in the outer court. Antinoos came up to him at once and laughed as he took his hand in his own, saying, ""Telemakhos, my fine fire-eater, bear no more ill blood neither in word nor deed, but eat and drink with us as you used to do. The Achaeans will find you in everything - a ship and a picked crew to boot - so that you can set sail for Pylos at once and get news of your noble father."""	ὣς φάτʼ Ἀθηναίη κούρη Διός· οὐδʼ ἄρʼ ἔτι δὴν Τηλέμαχος παρέμιμνεν, ἐπεὶ θεοῦ ἔκλυεν αὐδήν. βῆ δʼ ἰέναι πρὸς δῶμα, φίλον τετιημένος ἦτορ, εὗρε δʼ ἄρα μνηστῆρας ἀγήνορας ἐν μεγάροισιν, αἶγας ἀνιεμένους σιάλους θʼ εὕοντας ἐν αὐλῇ.

"""Antinoos,"" answered Telemakhos, ""I cannot eat in peace, nor take pleasure of any kind with such men as you are. Was it not enough that you should waste so much good property of mine while I was yet a boy? Now that I am older and know more about it, I am also stronger, and whether here among this people  , or by going to Pylos , I will do you all the harm I can. I shall go, and my going will not be in vain though, thanks to you suitors, I have neither ship nor crew of my own, and must be passenger not leader."""	τὸν δʼ αὖ Τηλέμαχος πεπνυμένος ἀντίον ηὔδα· Ἀντίνοʼ, οὔ πως ἔστιν ὑπερφιάλοισι μεθʼ ὑμῖν δαίνυσθαί τʼ ἀκέοντα καὶ εὐφραίνεσθαι ἕκηλον. ἦ οὐχ ἅλις ὡς τὸ πάροιθεν ἐκείρετε πολλὰ καὶ ἐσθλὰ κτήματʼ ἐμά, μνηστῆρες, ἐγὼ δʼ ἔτι νήπιος ἦα; νῦν δʼ ὅτε δὴ μέγας εἰμὶ καὶ ἄλλων μῦθον ἀκούων πυνθάνομαι, καὶ δή μοι ἀέξεται ἔνδοθι θυμός, πειρήσω, ὥς κʼ ὔμμι κακὰς ἐπὶ κῆρας ἰήλω, ἠὲ Πύλονδʼ ἐλθών, ἢ αὐτοῦ τῷδʼ ἐνὶ δήμῳ. εἶμι μέν, οὐδʼ ἁλίη ὁδὸς ἔσσεται ἣν ἀγορεύω, ἔμπορος· οὐ γὰρ νηὸς ἐπήβολος οὐδʼ ἐρετάων γίγνομαι· ὥς νύ που ὔμμιν ἐείσατο κέρδιον εἶναι.
As he spoke he snatched his hand from that of Antinoos. Meanwhile the others went on getting dinner ready about the buildings, jeering at him tauntingly as they did so.	ἦ ῥα, καὶ ἐκ χειρὸς χεῖρα σπάσατʼ Ἀντινόοιο ῥεῖα· μνηστῆρες δὲ δόμον κάτα δαῖτα πένοντο. οἱ δʼ ἐπελώβευον καὶ ἐκερτόμεον ἐπέεσσιν. ὧδε δέ τις εἴπεσκε νέων ὑπερηνορεόντων·
"""Telemakhos,"" said one youngster, ""means to be the death of us; I suppose he thinks he can bring friends to help him from Pylos , or again from Sparta , where he seems bent on going. Or will he go to Ephyra as well, for poison to put in our wine and kill us?"""	ἦ μάλα Τηλέμαχος φόνον ἡμῖν μερμηρίζει. ἤ τινας ἐκ Πύλου ἄξει ἀμύντορας ἠμαθόεντος ἢ ὅ γε καὶ Σπάρτηθεν, ἐπεί νύ περ ἵεται αἰνῶς· ἠὲ καὶ εἰς Ἐφύρην ἐθέλει, πίειραν ἄρουραν, ἐλθεῖν, ὄφρʼ ἔνθεν θυμοφθόρα φάρμακʼ ἐνείκῃ, ἐν δὲ βάλῃ κρητῆρι καὶ ἡμέας πάντας ὀλέσσῃ.
"Another said, ""Perhaps if Telemakhos goes on board ship, he will be like his father and perish far from his friends. In this case we should have plenty to do, for we could then divide up his property amongst us: as for the house we can let his mother and the man who marries her have that."""	ἄλλος δʼ αὖτʼ εἴπεσκε νέων ὑπερηνορεόντων· τίς δʼ οἶδʼ, εἴ κε καὶ αὐτὸς ἰὼν κοίλης ἐπὶ νηὸς τῆλε φίλων ἀπόληται ἀλώμενος ὥς περ Ὀδυσσεύς; οὕτω κεν καὶ μᾶλλον ὀφέλλειεν πόνον ἄμμιν· κτήματα γάρ κεν πάντα δασαίμεθα, οἰκία δʼ αὖτε τούτου μητέρι δοῖμεν ἔχειν ἠδʼ ὅς τις ὀπυίοι.
This was how they talked. But Telemakhos went down into the lofty and spacious store-room where his father's treasure of gold and bronze lay heaped up upon the floor, and where the linen and spare clothes were kept in open chests. Here, too, there was a store of fragrant olive oil, while casks of old, well-ripened wine, unblended and fit for a god to drink, were ranged against the wall in case Odysseus should come home again after all. The room was closed with well-made doors opening in the middle; moreover the faithful old house-keeper Eurykleia, daughter of Ops the son of Pisenor, was in charge of everything both night and day. Telemakhos called her to the store-room and said:	ὣς φάν, ὁ δʼ ὑψόροφον θάλαμον κατεβήσετο πατρὸς εὐρύν, ὅθι νητὸς χρυσὸς καὶ χαλκὸς ἔκειτο ἐσθής τʼ ἐν χηλοῖσιν ἅλις τʼ ἐυῶδες ἔλαιον· ἐν δὲ πίθοι οἴνοιο παλαιοῦ ἡδυπότοιο ἕστασαν, ἄκρητον θεῖον ποτὸν ἐντὸς ἔχοντες, ἑξείης ποτὶ τοῖχον ἀρηρότες, εἴ ποτʼ Ὀδυσσεὺς οἴκαδε νοστήσειε καὶ ἄλγεα πολλὰ μογήσας. κληισταὶ δʼ ἔπεσαν σανίδες πυκινῶς ἀραρυῖαι, δικλίδες· ἐν δὲ γυνὴ ταμίη νύκτας τε καὶ ἦμαρ ἔσχʼ, ἣ πάντʼ ἐφύλασσε νόου πολυϊδρείῃσιν, Εὐρύκλειʼ, Ὦπος θυγάτηρ Πεισηνορίδαο. τὴν τότε Τηλέμαχος προσέφη θαλαμόνδε καλέσσας·
"""Nurse, draw me off some of the best wine you have, after what you are keeping for my father's own drinking, in case, poor man, he should escape death, and find his way home again after all. Let me have twelve jars, and see that they all have lids; also fill me some well-sewn leathern bags with barley meal - about twenty measures in all. Get these things put together at once, and say nothing about it. I will take everything away this evening as soon as my mother has gone upstairs for the night. I am going to Sparta and to Pylos to see if I can hear anything about the of my dear father."	μαῖʼ, ἄγε δή μοι οἶνον ἐν ἀμφιφορεῦσιν ἄφυσσον ἡδύν, ὅτις μετὰ τὸν λαρώτατος ὃν σὺ φυλάσσεις κεῖνον ὀιομένη τὸν κάμμορον, εἴ ποθεν ἔλθοι διογενὴς Ὀδυσεὺς θάνατον καὶ κῆρας ἀλύξας. δώδεκα δʼ ἔμπλησον καὶ πώμασιν ἄρσον ἅπαντας. ἐν δέ μοι ἄλφιτα χεῦον ἐϋρραφέεσσι δοροῖσιν· εἴκοσι δʼ ἔστω μέτρα μυληφάτου ἀλφίτου ἀκτῆς. αὐτὴ δʼ οἴη ἴσθι· τὰ δʼ ἁθρόα πάντα τετύχθω· ἑσπέριος γὰρ ἐγὼν αἱρήσομαι, ὁππότε κεν δὴ μήτηρ εἰς ὑπερῷʼ ἀναβῇ κοίτου τε μέδηται. εἶμι γὰρ ἐς Σπάρτην τε καὶ ἐς Πύλον ἠμαθόεντα νόστον πευσόμενος πατρὸς φίλου, ἤν που ἀκούσω.
"When Eurykleia heard this she began to cry, and spoke fondly to him, saying, ""My dear child, what ever can have put such notion as that into your head? Where in the world do you want to go to - you, who are the one hope of the house? Your poor father is dead and gone in some foreign country   nobody knows where, and as soon as your back is turned these wicked ones here will be scheming to get you put out of the way, and will share all your possessions among themselves; stay where you are among your own people, and do not go wandering and worrying your life out on the barren ocean."""	ὣς φάτο, κώκυσεν δὲ φίλη τροφὸς Εὐρύκλεια, καί ῥʼ ὀλοφυρομένη ἔπεα πτερόεντα προσηύδα· τίπτε δέ τοι, φίλε τέκνον, ἐνὶ φρεσὶ τοῦτο νόημα ἔπλετο; πῇ δʼ ἐθέλεις ἰέναι πολλὴν ἐπὶ γαῖαν μοῦνος ἐὼν ἀγαπητός; ὁ δʼ ὤλετο τηλόθι πάτρης διογενὴς Ὀδυσεὺς ἀλλογνώτῳ ἐνὶ δήμῳ. οἱ δέ τοι αὐτίκʼ ἰόντι κακὰ φράσσονται ὀπίσσω, ὥς κε δόλῳ φθίῃς, τάδε δʼ αὐτοὶ πάντα δάσονται. ἀλλὰ μένʼ αὖθʼ ἐπὶ σοῖσι καθήμενος· οὐδέ τί σε χρὴ πόντον ἐπʼ ἀτρύγετον κακὰ πάσχειν οὐδʼ ἀλάλησθαι.
"""Fear not, nurse,"" answered Telemakhos, ""my scheme is not without heaven's sanction; but swear that you will say nothing about all this to my mother, till I have been away some ten or twelve days, unless she hears of my having gone, and asks you; for I do not want her to spoil her beauty by crying."""	τὴν δʼ αὖ Τηλέμαχος πεπνυμένος ἀντίον ηὔδα· θάρσει, μαῖʼ, ἐπεὶ οὔ τοι ἄνευ θεοῦ ἥδε γε βουλή. ἀλλʼ ὄμοσον μὴ μητρὶ φίλῃ τάδε μυθήσασθαι, πρίν γʼ ὅτʼ ἂν ἑνδεκάτη τε δυωδεκάτη τε γένηται, ἢ αὐτὴν ποθέσαι καὶ ἀφορμηθέντος ἀκοῦσαι, ὡς ἂν μὴ κλαίουσα κατὰ χρόα καλὸν ἰάπτῃ.
The old woman swore most solemnly that she would not, and when she had completed her oath, she began drawing off the wine into jars, and getting the barley meal into the bags, while Telemakhos went back to the suitors.	ὣς ἄρʼ ἔφη, γρῆυς δὲ θεῶν μέγαν ὅρκον ἀπώμνυ. αὐτὰρ ἐπεί ῥʼ ὄμοσέν τε τελεύτησέν τε τὸν ὅρκον, αὐτίκʼ ἔπειτά οἱ οἶνον ἐν ἀμφιφορεῦσιν ἄφυσσεν, ἐν δέ οἱ ἄλφιτα χεῦεν ἐϋρραφέεσσι δοροῖσι. Τηλέμαχος δʼ ἐς δώματʼ ἰὼν μνηστῆρσιν ὁμίλει.
Then Athena bethought her of another matter. She took his shape, and went round the town to each one of the crew, telling them to meet at the ship by sundown. She went also to Noemon son of Phronios, and asked him to let her have a ship - which he was very ready to do. When the sun had set and darkness was over all the land, she got the ship into the water, put all the tackle on board her that ships generally carry, and stationed her at the end of the harbor. Presently the crew came up, and the goddess spoke encouragingly to each of them.	ἔνθʼ αὖτʼ ἄλλʼ ἐνόησε θεά, γλαυκῶπις Ἀθήνη. Τηλεμάχῳ ἐικυῖα κατὰ πτόλιν ᾤχετο πάντῃ, καί ῥα ἑκάστῳ φωτὶ παρισταμένη φάτο μῦθον, ἑσπερίους δʼ ἐπὶ νῆα θοὴν ἀγέρεσθαι ἀνώγει. ἡ δʼ αὖτε Φρονίοιο Νοήμονα φαίδιμον υἱὸν ᾔτεε νῆα θοήν· ὁ δέ οἱ πρόφρων ὑπέδεκτο. δύσετό τʼ ἠέλιος σκιόωντό τε πᾶσαι ἀγυιαί, καὶ τότε νῆα θοὴν ἅλαδʼ εἴρυσε, πάντα δʼ ἐν αὐτῇ ὅπλʼ ἐτίθει, τά τε νῆες ἐύσσελμοι φορέουσι. στῆσε δʼ ἐπʼ ἐσχατιῇ λιμένος, περὶ δʼ ἐσθλοὶ ἑταῖροι ἁθρόοι ἠγερέθοντο· θεὰ δʼ ὤτρυνεν ἕκαστον.
Furthermore she went to the house of Odysseus, and threw the suitors into a deep slumber. She caused their drink to fuddle them, and made them drop their cups from their hands, so that instead of sitting over their wine, they went back into the town to sleep, with their eyes heavy and full of drowsiness. Then she took the form and voice of Mentor, and called Telemakhos to come outside.	ἔνθʼ αὖτʼ ἄλλʼ ἐνόησε θεά, γλαυκῶπις Ἀθήνη. βῆ ῤʼ ἰέναι πρὸς δώματʼ Ὀδυσσῆος θείοιο· ἔνθα μνηστήρεσσιν ἐπὶ γλυκὺν ὕπνον ἔχευε, πλάζε δὲ πίνοντας, χειρῶν δʼ ἔκβαλλε κύπελλα. οἱ δʼ εὕδειν ὤρνυντο κατὰ πτόλιν, οὐδʼ ἄρʼ ἔτι δὴν ἥατʼ, ἐπεί σφισιν ὕπνος ἐπὶ βλεφάροισιν ἔπιπτεν. αὐτὰρ Τηλέμαχον προσέφη γλαυκῶπις Ἀθήνη ἐκπροκαλεσσαμένη μεγάρων ἐὺ ναιεταόντων, Μέντορι εἰδομένη ἠμὲν δέμας ἠδὲ καὶ αὐδήν·
"""Telemakhos,"" said she, ""the men are on board and at their oars, waiting for you to give your orders, so make haste and let us be off."""	Τηλέμαχʼ, ἤδη μέν τοι ἐυκνήμιδες ἑταῖροι ἥατʼ ἐπήρετμοι τὴν σὴν ποτιδέγμενοι ὁρμήν· ἀλλʼ ἴομεν, μὴ δηθὰ διατρίβωμεν ὁδοῖο.
"On this she led the way, while Telemakhos followed in her steps. When they got to the ship they found the crew waiting by the water side, and Telemakhos said, ""Now my men, help me to get the stores on board; they are all put together in the room, and my mother does not know anything about it, nor any of the maid servants except one."""	ὣς ἄρα φωνήσασʼ ἡγήσατο Παλλὰς Ἀθήνη καρπαλίμως· ὁ δʼ ἔπειτα μετʼ ἴχνια βαῖνε θεοῖο. αὐτὰρ ἐπεί ῥʼ ἐπὶ νῆα κατήλυθον ἠδὲ θάλασσαν, εὗρον ἔπειτʼ ἐπὶ θινὶ κάρη κομόωντας ἑταίρους. τοῖσι δὲ καὶ μετέειφʼ ἱερὴ ἲς Τηλεμάχοιο· δεῦτε, φίλοι, ἤια φερώμεθα· πάντα γὰρ ἤδη ἁθρόʼ ἐνὶ μεγάρῳ. μήτηρ δʼ ἐμὴ οὔ τι πέπυσται, οὐδʼ ἄλλαι δμωαί, μία δʼ οἴη μῦθον ἄκουσεν.
With these words he led the way and the others followed after. When they had brought the things as he told them, Telemakhos went on board, Athena going before him and taking her seat in the stern of the vessel, while Telemakhos sat beside her. Then the men loosed the hawsers and took their places on the benches. Athena sent them a fair wind from the West, that whistled over the seething deep waves whereon Telemakhos told them to catch hold of the ropes and hoist sail, and they did as he told them. They set the mast in its socket in the cross plank, raised it, and made it fast with the forestays; then they hoisted their white sails aloft with ropes of twisted ox hide. As the sail bellied out with the wind, the ship flew through the seething deep water, and the foam hissed against her bows as she sped onward. Then they made all fast throughout the ship, filled the mixing-bowls to the brim, and made drink offerings to the immortal gods that are from everlasting, but more particularly to the gray-eyed daughter of Zeus.	ὣς ἄρα φωνήσας ἡγήσατο, τοὶ δʼ ἅμʼ ἕποντο. οἱ δʼ ἄρα πάντα φέροντες ἐυσσέλμῳ ἐπὶ νηὶ κάτθεσαν, ὡς ἐκέλευσεν Ὀδυσσῆος φίλος υἱός. ἂν δʼ ἄρα Τηλέμαχος νηὸς βαῖνʼ, ἦρχε δʼ Ἀθήνη, νηὶ δʼ ἐνὶ πρυμνῇ κατʼ ἄρʼ ἕζετο· ἄγχι δʼ ἄρʼ αὐτῆς ἕζετο Τηλέμαχος. τοὶ δὲ πρυμνήσιʼ ἔλυσαν, ἂν δὲ καὶ αὐτοὶ βάντες ἐπὶ κληῖσι καθῖζον. τοῖσιν δʼ ἴκμενον οὖρον ἵει γλαυκῶπις Ἀθήνη, ἀκραῆ Ζέφυρον, κελάδοντʼ ἐπὶ οἴνοπα πόντον. Τηλέμαχος δʼ ἑτάροισιν ἐποτρύνας ἐκέλευσεν ὅπλων ἅπτεσθαι· τοὶ δʼ ὀτρύνοντος ἄκουσαν. ἱστὸν δʼ εἰλάτινον κοίλης ἔντοσθε μεσόδμης στῆσαν ἀείραντες, κατὰ δὲ προτόνοισιν ἔδησαν, ἕλκον δʼ ἱστία λευκὰ ἐυστρέπτοισι βοεῦσιν. ἔπρησεν δʼ ἄνεμος μέσον ἱστίον, ἀμφὶ δὲ κῦμα στείρῃ πορφύρεον μεγάλʼ ἴαχε νηὸς ἰούσης· ἡ δʼ ἔθεεν κατὰ κῦμα διαπρήσσουσα κέλευθον. δησάμενοι δʼ ἄρα ὅπλα θοὴν ἀνὰ νῆα μέλαιναν στήσαντο κρητῆρας ἐπιστεφέας οἴνοιο, λεῖβον δʼ ἀθανάτοισι θεοῖς αἰειγενέτῃσιν, ἐκ πάντων δὲ μάλιστα Διὸς γλαυκώπιδι κούρῃ.
Thus, then, the ship sped on her way through the watches of the night from dark till dawn.	παννυχίη μέν ῥʼ ἥ γε καὶ ἠῶ πεῖρε κέλευθον.
But as the sun was rising from the fair sea into the firmament of heaven to shed light on mortals and immortals, they reached Pylos the city of Neleus. Now the people of Pylos were gathered on the sea shore to offer sacrifice of black bulls to Poseidon lord of the Earthquake. There were nine guilds with five hundred men in each, and there were nine bulls to each guild. As they were eating the inward meats and burning the thigh bones on the embers in the name of Poseidon, Telemakhos and his crew arrived, furled their sails, brought their ship to anchor, and went ashore.	Ἠέλιος δʼ ἀνόρουσε, λιπὼν περικαλλέα λίμνην, οὐρανὸν ἐς πολύχαλκον, ἵνʼ ἀθανάτοισι φαείνοι καὶ θνητοῖσι βροτοῖσιν ἐπὶ ζείδωρον ἄρουραν· οἱ δὲ Πύλον, Νηλῆος ἐυκτίμενον πτολίεθρον, ἷξον· τοὶ δʼ ἐπὶ θινὶ θαλάσσης ἱερὰ ῥέζον, ταύρους παμμέλανας, ἐνοσίχθονι κυανοχαίτῃ. ἐννέα δʼ ἕδραι ἔσαν, πεντακόσιοι δʼ ἐν ἑκάστῃ ἥατο καὶ προύχοντο ἑκάστοθι ἐννέα ταύρους. εὖθʼ οἱ σπλάγχνα πάσαντο, θεῷ δʼ ἐπὶ μηρίʼ ἔκαιον, οἱ δʼ ἰθὺς κατάγοντο ἰδʼ ἱστία νηὸς ἐίσης στεῖλαν ἀείραντες, τὴν δʼ ὥρμισαν, ἐκ δʼ ἔβαν αὐτοί·
"Athena led the way and Telemakhos followed her. Presently she said, ""Telemakhos, you must not at all feel or be nervous; you have taken this voyage to try and find out where your father is buried and how he came by his end; so go straight up to Nestor that we may see what he has got to tell us. Beg of him to speak the truth, and he will tell no lies, for he is an excellent person."""	ἐκ δʼ ἄρα Τηλέμαχος νηὸς βαῖνʼ, ἦρχε δʼ Ἀθήνη. τὸν προτέρη προσέειπε θεά, γλαυκῶπις Ἀθήνη· Τηλέμαχʼ, οὐ μέν σε χρὴ ἔτʼ αἰδοῦς, οὐδʼ ἠβαιόν· τοὔνεκα γὰρ καὶ πόντον ἐπέπλως, ὄφρα πύθηαι πατρός, ὅπου κύθε γαῖα καὶ ὅν τινα πότμον ἐπέσπεν. ἀλλʼ ἄγε νῦν ἰθὺς κίε Νέστορος ἱπποδάμοιο· εἴδομεν ἥν τινα μῆτιν ἐνὶ στήθεσσι κέκευθε. λίσσεσθαι δέ μιν αὐτός, ὅπως νημερτέα εἴπῃ· ψεῦδος δʼ οὐκ ἐρέει· μάλα γὰρ πεπνυμένος ἐστί.
"""But how, Mentor,"" replied Telemakhos, ""dare I go up to Nestor, and how am I to address him? I have never yet been used to holding long conversations with people, and feel about questioning one who is so much older than myself."""	τὴν δʼ αὖ Τηλέμαχος πεπνυμένος ἀντίον ηὔδα· Μέντορ, πῶς τʼ ἄρʼ ἴω; πῶς τʼ ἂρ προσπτύξομαι αὐτόν; οὐδέ τί πω μύθοισι πεπείρημαι πυκινοῖσιν· αἰδὼς δʼ αὖ νέον ἄνδρα γεραίτερον ἐξερέεσθαι.
"""Some things, Telemakhos,"" answered Athena, ""will be suggested to you by your own instinct, and some will prompt you further; for I am assured that the gods have been with you from the time of your birth until now."""	τὸν δʼ αὖτε προσέειπε θεά, γλαυκῶπις Ἀθήνη· Τηλέμαχʼ, ἄλλα μὲν αὐτὸς ἐνὶ φρεσὶ σῇσι νοήσεις, ἄλλα δὲ καὶ δαίμων ὑποθήσεται· οὐ γὰρ ὀίω οὔ σε θεῶν ἀέκητι γενέσθαι τε τραφέμεν τε.
She then went quickly on, and Telemakhos followed in her steps till they reached the place where the guilds of the Pylian people were assembled. There they found Nestor sitting with his sons, while his company round him were busy getting dinner ready, and putting pieces of meat on to the spits while other pieces were cooking. When they saw the strangers they crowded round them, took them by the hand and bade them take their places. Nestor's son Peisistratos at once offered his hand to each of them, and seated them on some soft sheepskins that were lying on the sands near his father and his brother Thrasymedes. Then he gave them their portions of the inward meats and poured wine for them into a golden cup, handing it to Athena first, and saluting her at the same time.	ὣς ἄρα φωνήσασʼ ἡγήσατο Παλλὰς Ἀθήνη καρπαλίμως· ὁ δʼ ἔπειτα μετʼ ἴχνια βαῖνε θεοῖο. ἷξον δʼ ἐς Πυλίων ἀνδρῶν ἄγυρίν τε καὶ ἕδρας, ἔνθʼ ἄρα Νέστωρ ἧστο σὺν υἱάσιν, ἀμφὶ δʼ ἑταῖροι δαῖτʼ ἐντυνόμενοι κρέα τʼ ὤπτων ἄλλα τʼ ἔπειρον. οἱ δʼ ὡς οὖν ξείνους ἴδον, ἁθρόοι ἦλθον ἅπαντες, χερσίν τʼ ἠσπάζοντο καὶ ἑδριάασθαι ἄνωγον. πρῶτος Νεστορίδης Πεισίστρατος ἐγγύθεν ἐλθὼν ἀμφοτέρων ἕλε χεῖρα καὶ ἵδρυσεν παρὰ δαιτὶ κώεσιν ἐν μαλακοῖσιν ἐπὶ ψαμάθοις ἁλίῃσιν πάρ τε κασιγνήτῳ Θρασυμήδεϊ καὶ πατέρι ᾧ· δῶκε δʼ ἄρα σπλάγχνων μοίρας, ἐν δʼ οἶνον ἔχευεν χρυσείῳ δέπαϊ· δειδισκόμενος δὲ προσηύδα Παλλάδʼ Ἀθηναίην κούρην Διὸς αἰγιόχοιο·
"""Offer a prayer, sir,"" said he, ""to lord Poseidon, for it is his feast that you are joining; when you have duly prayed and made your drink-offering, pass the cup to your friend that he may do so also. I doubt not that he too lifts his hands in prayer, for man cannot live without gods in the world. Still, he is younger than you are, and is much of an age with myself, so I will give you the precedence."""	εὔχεο νῦν, ὦ ξεῖνε, Ποσειδάωνι ἄνακτι· τοῦ γὰρ καὶ δαίτης ἠντήσατε δεῦρο μολόντες. αὐτὰρ ἐπὴν σπείσῃς τε καὶ εὔξεαι, ἣ θέμις ἐστί, δὸς καὶ τούτῳ ἔπειτα δέπας μελιηδέος οἴνου σπεῖσαι, ἐπεὶ καὶ τοῦτον ὀίομαι ἀθανάτοισιν εὔχεσθαι· πάντες δὲ θεῶν χατέουσʼ ἄνθρωποι. ἀλλὰ νεώτερός ἐστιν, ὁμηλικίη δʼ ἐμοὶ αὐτῷ· τοὔνεκα σοὶ προτέρῳ δώσω χρύσειον ἄλεισον.
"As he spoke he handed her the cup. Athena thought that he was just   and right to have given it to herself first; she accordingly began praying heartily to Poseidon. ""O you,"" she cried, ""who encircle the earth, deign to grant the prayers of your servants that call upon you. More especially we pray you send down your grace on Nestor and on his sons; thereafter also make the rest of the Pylian people some handsome return for the goodly hecatomb they are offering you. Lastly, grant Telemakhos and myself a happy issue, in respect of the matter that has brought us in our to Pylos ."""	ὣς εἰπὼν ἐν χειρὶ τίθει δέπας ἡδέος οἴνου· χαῖρε δʼ Ἀθηναίη πεπνυμένῳ ἀνδρὶ δικαίῳ, οὕνεκα οἷ προτέρῃ δῶκε χρύσειον ἄλεισον· αὐτίκα δʼ εὔχετο πολλὰ Ποσειδάωνι ἄνακτι· κλῦθι, Ποσείδαον γαιήοχε, μηδὲ μεγήρῃς ἡμῖν εὐχομένοισι τελευτῆσαι τάδε ἔργα.

When she had thus made an end of praying, she handed the cup to Telemakhos and he prayed likewise. By and by, when the outer meats were roasted and had been taken off the spits, the carvers gave every man his portion and they all made an excellent dinner. As soon as they had had enough to eat and drink, Nestor, horseman of Gerene, began to speak.	ὣς ἄρʼ ἔπειτʼ ἠρᾶτο καὶ αὐτὴ πάντα τελεύτα. δῶκε δὲ Τηλεμάχῳ καλὸν δέπας ἀμφικύπελλον· ὣς δʼ αὔτως ἠρᾶτο Ὀδυσσῆος φίλος υἱός. οἱ δʼ ἐπεὶ ὤπτησαν κρέʼ ὑπέρτερα καὶ ἐρύσαντο, μοίρας δασσάμενοι δαίνυντʼ ἐρικυδέα δαῖτα. αὐτὰρ ἐπεὶ πόσιος καὶ ἐδητύος ἐξ ἔρον ἕντο, τοῖς ἄρα μύθων ἦρχε Γερήνιος ἱππότα Νέστωρ·

Or do you sail the seas as rovers with your hand against every man, and every man's hand against you?"""	νῦν δὴ κάλλιόν ἐστι μεταλλῆσαι καὶ ἐρέσθαι ξείνους, οἱ τινές εἰσιν, ἐπεὶ τάρπησαν ἐδωδῆς. ὦ ξεῖνοι, τίνες ἐστέ; πόθεν πλεῖθʼ ὑγρὰ κέλευθα; ἤ τι κατὰ πρῆξιν ἦ μαψιδίως ἀλάλησθε οἷά τε ληιστῆρες ὑπεὶρ ἅλα, τοί τʼ ἀλόωνται ψυχὰς παρθέμενοι κακὸν ἀλλοδαποῖσι φέροντες;
Telemakhos answered boldly, for Athena had given him courage to ask about his father and get himself a good name  .	τὸν δʼ αὖ Τηλέμαχος πεπνυμένος ἀντίον ηὔδα θαρσήσας· αὐτὴ γὰρ ἐνὶ φρεσὶ θάρσος Ἀθήνη θῆχʼ, ἵνα μιν περὶ πατρὸς ἀποιχομένοιο ἔροιτο ἠδʼ ἵνα μιν κλέος ἐσθλὸν ἐν ἀνθρώποισιν ἔχῃσιν·
"""Nestor,"" said he, ""son of Neleus, honor to the Achaean name, you ask whence we come, and I will tell you. We come from Ithaca under Neritum, and the matter about which I would speak is of private not public import. I seek news   of my unhappy father Odysseus, who is said to have sacked the town of Troy in company with yourself. We know what fate befell each one of the other heroes who fought at Troy , but as regards Odysseus heaven has hidden from us the knowledge even that he is dead at all, for no one can certify us in what place he perished, nor say whether he fell in battle on the mainland, or was lost at sea amid the waves of Amphitrite. Therefore I am suppliant at your knees, if haply you may be pleased to tell me of his melancholy end, whether you saw it with your own eyes, or heard it from some other traveler, for he was a man born to trouble. Do not soften things out of any pity for me, but tell me in all plainness exactly what you saw. If my brave father Odysseus ever did you loyal service, either by word or deed, when you Achaeans were harassed at the district   of the Trojans, bear it in mind now as in my favor and tell me truly all."""	ὦ Νέστορ Νηληϊάδη, μέγα κῦδος Ἀχαιῶν, εἴρεαι ὁππόθεν εἰμέν· ἐγὼ δέ κέ τοι καταλέξω. ἡμεῖς ἐξ Ἰθάκης ὑπονηίου εἰλήλουθμεν· πρῆξις δʼ ἥδʼ ἰδίη, οὐ δήμιος, ἣν ἀγορεύω. πατρὸς ἐμοῦ κλέος εὐρὺ μετέρχομαι, ἤν που ἀκούσω, δίου Ὀδυσσῆος ταλασίφρονος, ὅν ποτέ φασι σὺν σοὶ μαρνάμενον Τρώων πόλιν ἐξαλαπάξαι. ἄλλους μὲν γὰρ πάντας, ὅσοι Τρωσὶν πολέμιζον, πευθόμεθʼ, ἧχι ἕκαστος ἀπώλετο λυγρῷ ὀλέθρῳ, κείνου δʼ αὖ καὶ ὄλεθρον ἀπευθέα θῆκε Κρονίων. οὐ γάρ τις δύναται σάφα εἰπέμεν ὁππόθʼ ὄλωλεν, εἴθʼ ὅ γʼ ἐπʼ ἠπείρου δάμη ἀνδράσι δυσμενέεσσιν, εἴτε καὶ ἐν πελάγει μετὰ κύμασιν Ἀμφιτρίτης. τοὔνεκα νῦν τὰ σὰ γούναθʼ ἱκάνομαι, αἴ κʼ ἐθέλῃσθα κείνου λυγρὸν ὄλεθρον ἐνισπεῖν, εἴ που ὄπωπας ὀφθαλμοῖσι τεοῖσιν ἢ ἄλλου μῦθον ἄκουσας πλαζομένου· πέρι γάρ μιν ὀιζυρὸν τέκε μήτηρ. μηδέ τί μʼ αἰδόμενος μειλίσσεο μηδʼ ἐλεαίρων, ἀλλʼ εὖ μοι κατάλεξον ὅπως ἤντησας ὀπωπῆς. λίσσομαι, εἴ ποτέ τοί τι πατὴρ ἐμός, ἐσθλὸς Ὀδυσσεύς, ἢ ἔπος ἠέ τι ἔργον ὑποστὰς ἐξετέλεσσε δήμῳ ἔνι Τρώων, ὅθι πάσχετε πήματʼ Ἀχαιοί, τῶν νῦν μοι μνῆσαι, καί μοι νημερτὲς ἐνίσπες.
"""My friend,"" answered Nestor, ""you recall a time of much sorrow to my mind, for the brave Achaeans suffered much both at sea, while privateering under Achilles, and in that district   when fighting before the great city of king Priam. Our best men all of them fell there - Ajax, Achilles, Patroklos peer of gods in counsel, and my own dear son Antilokhos, a man singularly fleet of foot and in fight valiant. But we suffered much more than this; what mortal tongue indeed could tell the whole story? Though you were to stay here and question me for five years, or even six, I could not tell you all that the Achaeans suffered, and you would turn homeward weary of my tale before it ended. Nine long years did we try every kind of stratagem, but the hand of heaven was against us; during all this time there was no one who could compare with your father in subtlety - if indeed you are his son. I can hardly believe my eyes - and you talk just like him too - no one would say that people of such different ages could speak so much alike. He and I never had any kind of difference from first to last neither in camp nor council, but in singleness of heart and purpose   we advised the Argives how all might be ordered for the best."	τὸν δʼ ἠμείβετʼ ἔπειτα Γερήνιος ἱππότα Νέστωρ· ὦ φίλʼ, ἐπεί μʼ ἔμνησας ὀιζύος, ἣν ἐν ἐκείνῳ δήμῳ ἀνέτλημεν μένος ἄσχετοι υἷες Ἀχαιῶν, ἠμὲν ὅσα ξὺν νηυσὶν ἐπʼ ἠεροειδέα πόντον πλαζόμενοι κατὰ ληίδʼ, ὅπῃ ἄρξειεν Ἀχιλλεύς, ἠδʼ ὅσα καὶ περὶ ἄστυ μέγα Πριάμοιο ἄνακτος μαρνάμεθʼ· ἔνθα δʼ ἔπειτα κατέκταθεν ὅσσοι ἄριστοι. ἔνθα μὲν Αἴας κεῖται ἀρήιος, ἔνθα δʼ Ἀχιλλεύς, ἔνθα δὲ Πάτροκλος, θεόφιν μήστωρ ἀτάλαντος, ἔνθα δʼ ἐμὸς φίλος υἱός, ἅμα κρατερὸς καὶ ἀμύμων, Ἀντίλοχος, πέρι μὲν θείειν ταχὺς ἠδὲ μαχητής· ἄλλα τε πόλλʼ ἐπὶ τοῖς πάθομεν κακά· τίς κεν ἐκεῖνα πάντα γε μυθήσαιτο καταθνητῶν ἀνθρώπων; οὐδʼ εἰ πεντάετές γε καὶ ἑξάετες παραμίμνων ἐξερέοις ὅσα κεῖθι πάθον κακὰ δῖοι Ἀχαιοί· πρίν κεν ἀνιηθεὶς σὴν πατρίδα γαῖαν ἵκοιο. εἰνάετες γάρ σφιν κακὰ ῥάπτομεν ἀμφιέποντες παντοίοισι δόλοισι, μόγις δʼ ἐτέλεσσε Κρονίων. ἔνθʼ οὔ τίς ποτε μῆτιν ὁμοιωθήμεναι ἄντην ἤθελʼ, ἐπεὶ μάλα πολλὸν ἐνίκα δῖος Ὀδυσσεὺς παντοίοισι δόλοισι, πατὴρ τεός, εἰ ἐτεόν γε κείνου ἔκγονός ἐσσι· σέβας μʼ ἔχει εἰσορόωντα. ἦ τοι γὰρ μῦθοί γε ἐοικότες, οὐδέ κε φαίης ἄνδρα νεώτερον ὧδε ἐοικότα μυθήσασθαι. ἔνθʼ ἦ τοι ἧος μὲν ἐγὼ καὶ δῖος Ὀδυσσεὺς οὔτε ποτʼ εἰν ἀγορῇ δίχʼ ἐβάζομεν οὔτʼ ἐνὶ βουλῇ, ἀλλʼ ἕνα θυμὸν ἔχοντε νόῳ καὶ ἐπίφρονι βουλῇ φραζόμεθʼ Ἀργείοισιν ὅπως ὄχʼ ἄριστα γένοιτο.
"""When however, we had sacked the city of Priam, and were setting sail in our ships as heaven had dispersed us, then Zeus saw fit to vex the Argives on their homeward voyage  ; for they had not all been either wise or just  , and hence many came to a bad end through the displeasure   of Zeus' daughter Athena, who brought about a quarrel between the two sons of Atreus."	αὐτὰρ ἐπεὶ Πριάμοιο πόλιν διεπέρσαμεν αἰπήν, βῆμεν δʼ ἐν νήεσσι, θεὸς δʼ ἐκέδασσεν Ἀχαιούς, καὶ τότε δὴ Ζεὺς λυγρὸν ἐνὶ φρεσὶ μήδετο νόστον Ἀργείοις, ἐπεὶ οὔ τι νοήμονες οὐδὲ δίκαιοι πάντες ἔσαν· τῶ σφεων πολέες κακὸν οἶτον ἐπέσπον μήνιος ἐξ ὀλοῆς γλαυκώπιδος ὀβριμοπάτρης. ἥ τʼ ἔριν Ἀτρεΐδῃσι μετʼ ἀμφοτέροισιν ἔθηκε.
"""The sons of Atreus called a meeting which was not according to , for it was sunset and the Achaeans were heavy with wine. When they explained why they had called the people together, it seemed that Menelaos was for sailing homeward   at once, and this displeased Agamemnon, who thought that we should wait till we had offered hecatombs to appease the anger of Athena. Fool that he was, he might have known that he would not prevail with her, for when the gods have made up their minds   they do not change them lightly. So the two stood bandying hard words, whereon the Achaeans sprang to their feet with a cry that rent the air, and were of two minds as to what they should do."	τὼ δὲ καλεσσαμένω ἀγορὴν ἐς πάντας Ἀχαιούς, μάψ, ἀτὰρ οὐ κατὰ κόσμον, ἐς ἠέλιον καταδύντα, οἱ ἦλθον οἴνῳ βεβαρηότες υἷες Ἀχαιῶν, μῦθον μυθείσθην, τοῦ εἵνεκα λαὸν ἄγειραν. ἔνθʼ ἤ τοι Μενέλαος ἀνώγει πάντας Ἀχαιοὺς νόστου μιμνήσκεσθαι ἐπʼ εὐρέα νῶτα θαλάσσης, οὐδʼ Ἀγαμέμνονι πάμπαν ἑήνδανε· βούλετο γάρ ῥα λαὸν ἐρυκακέειν ῥέξαι θʼ ἱερὰς ἑκατόμβας, ὡς τὸν Ἀθηναίης δεινὸν χόλον ἐξακέσαιτο, νήπιος, οὐδὲ τὸ ᾔδη, ὃ οὐ πείσεσθαι ἔμελλεν· οὐ γάρ τʼ αἶψα θεῶν τρέπεται νόος αἰὲν ἐόντων. ὣς τὼ μὲν χαλεποῖσιν ἀμειβομένω ἐπέεσσιν ἕστασαν· οἱ δʼ ἀνόρουσαν ἐυκνήμιδες Ἀχαιοὶ ἠχῇ θεσπεσίῃ, δίχα δέ σφισιν ἥνδανε βουλή.
"""That night we rested and nursed our anger, for Zeus was hatching mischief against us. But in the morning some of us drew our ships into the water and put our goods with our women on board, while the rest, about half in number, stayed behind with Agamemnon. We - the other half - embarked and sailed; and the ships went well, for heaven had smoothed the sea. When we reached Tenedos we offered sacrifices to the gods, for we were longing to get home  ; cruel Zeus, however, did not yet mean that we should do so, and raised a second quarrel in the course of which some among us turned their ships back again, and sailed away under Odysseus to make their peace with Agamemnon; but I, and all the ships that were with me pressed forward, for I saw that mischief was brewing. The son of Tydeus went on also with me, and his crews with him. Later on Menelaos joined us at Lesbos , and found us making up our minds about our course - for we did not know whether to go outside Chios by the island of Psyra, keeping this to our left, or inside Chios , over against the stormy headland of Mimas. So we asked heaven   for a sign, and were shown one to the effect that we should be soonest out of danger if we headed our ships across the open sea to Euboea . This we therefore did, and a fair wind sprang up which gave us a quick passage during the night to Geraistos , where we offered many sacrifices to Poseidon for having helped us so far on our way. Four days later Diomedes and his men stationed their ships in Argos , but I held on for Pylos , and the wind never fell light from the day when heaven first made it fair for me."	νύκτα μὲν ἀέσαμεν χαλεπὰ φρεσὶν ὁρμαίνοντες ἀλλήλοις· ἐπὶ γὰρ Ζεὺς ἤρτυε πῆμα κακοῖο· ἠῶθεν δʼ οἱ μὲν νέας ἕλκομεν εἰς ἅλα δῖαν κτήματά τʼ ἐντιθέμεσθα βαθυζώνους τε γυναῖκας. ἡμίσεες δʼ ἄρα λαοὶ ἐρητύοντο μένοντες αὖθι παρʼ Ἀτρεΐδῃ Ἀγαμέμνονι, ποιμένι λαῶν· ἡμίσεες δʼ ἀναβάντες ἐλαύνομεν· αἱ δὲ μάλʼ ὦκα ἔπλεον, ἐστόρεσεν δὲ θεὸς μεγακήτεα πόντον. ἐς Τένεδον δʼ ἐλθόντες ἐρέξαμεν ἱρὰ θεοῖσιν, οἴκαδε ἱέμενοι· Ζεὺς δʼ οὔ πω μήδετο νόστον, σχέτλιος, ὅς ῥʼ ἔριν ὦρσε κακὴν ἔπι δεύτερον αὖτις. οἱ μὲν ἀποστρέψαντες ἔβαν νέας ἀμφιελίσσας ἀμφʼ Ὀδυσῆα ἄνακτα δαΐφρονα, ποικιλομήτην, αὖτις ἐπʼ Ἀτρεΐδῃ Ἀγαμέμνονι ἦρα φέροντες· αὐτὰρ ἐγὼ σὺν νηυσὶν ἀολλέσιν, αἵ μοι ἕποντο, φεῦγον, ἐπεὶ γίγνωσκον, ὃ δὴ κακὰ μήδετο δαίμων. φεῦγε δὲ Τυδέος υἱὸς ἀρήιος, ὦρσε δʼ ἑταίρους. ὀψὲ δὲ δὴ μετὰ νῶι κίε ξανθὸς Μενέλαος, ἐν Λέσβῳ δʼ ἔκιχεν δολιχὸν πλόον ὁρμαίνοντας, ἢ καθύπερθε Χίοιο νεοίμεθα παιπαλοέσσης, νήσου ἔπι Ψυρίης, αὐτὴν ἐπʼ ἀριστέρʼ ἔχοντες, ἦ ὑπένερθε Χίοιο, παρʼ ἠνεμόεντα Μίμαντα. ᾐτέομεν δὲ θεὸν φῆναι τέρας· αὐτὰρ ὅ γʼ ἡμῖν δεῖξε, καὶ ἠνώγει πέλαγος μέσον εἰς Εὔβοιαν τέμνειν, ὄφρα τάχιστα ὑπὲκ κακότητα φύγοιμεν. ὦρτο δʼ ἐπὶ λιγὺς οὖρος ἀήμεναι· αἱ δὲ μάλʼ ὦκα ἰχθυόεντα κέλευθα διέδραμον, ἐς δὲ Γεραιστὸν ἐννύχιαι κατάγοντο· Ποσειδάωνι δὲ ταύρων πόλλʼ ἐπὶ μῆρʼ ἔθεμεν, πέλαγος μέγα μετρήσαντες. τέτρατον ἦμαρ ἔην, ὅτʼ ἐν Ἄργεϊ νῆας ἐίσας Τυδεΐδεω ἕταροι Διομήδεος ἱπποδάμοιο ἵστασαν· αὐτὰρ ἐγώ γε Πύλονδʼ ἔχον, οὐδέ ποτʼ ἔσβη οὖρος, ἐπεὶ δὴ πρῶτα θεὸς προέηκεν ἀῆναι.

If Athena were to take as great a liking to you as she did to Odysseus when we were fighting in the Trojan (for I never yet saw the gods so openly fond of any one as Athena then was of your father), if she would take as good care of you as she did of him, these wooers would soon some of them forget their wooing."""	τὸν δʼ ἠμείβετʼ ἔπειτα Γερήνιος ἱππότα Νέστωρ· ὦ φίλʼ, ἐπεὶ δὴ ταῦτά μʼ ἀνέμνησας καὶ ἔειπες, φασὶ μνηστῆρας σῆς μητέρος εἵνεκα πολλοὺς ἐν μεγάροις ἀέκητι σέθεν κακὰ μηχανάασθαι· εἰπέ μοι, ἠὲ ἑκὼν ὑποδάμνασαι, ἦ σέ γε λαοὶ ἐχθαίρουσʼ ἀνὰ δῆμον, ἐπισπόμενοι θεοῦ ὀμφῇ. τίς δʼ οἶδʼ εἴ κέ ποτέ σφι βίας ἀποτίσεται ἐλθών, ἢ ὅ γε μοῦνος ἐὼν ἢ καὶ σύμπαντες Ἀχαιοί; εἰ γάρ σʼ ὣς ἐθέλοι φιλέειν γλαυκῶπις Ἀθήνη, ὡς τότʼ Ὀδυσσῆος περικήδετο κυδαλίμοιο δήμῳ ἔνι Τρώων, ὅθι πάσχομεν ἄλγεʼ Ἀχαιοί— οὐ γάρ πω ἴδον ὧδε θεοὺς ἀναφανδὰ φιλεῦντας, ὡς κείνῳ ἀναφανδὰ παρίστατο Παλλὰς Ἀθήνη— εἴ σʼ οὕτως ἐθέλοι φιλέειν κήδοιτό τε θυμῷ, τῶ κέν τις κείνων γε καὶ ἐκλελάθοιτο γάμοιο.

Still, death is certain, and when a man's hour is come, not even the gods can save him, no matter how fond they are of him."""	τὸν δʼ αὖτε προσέειπε θεά, γλαυκῶπις Ἀθήνη· Τηλέμαχε, ποῖόν σε ἔπος φύγεν ἕρκος ὀδόντων. ῥεῖα θεός γʼ ἐθέλων καὶ τηλόθεν ἄνδρα σαώσαι. βουλοίμην δʼ ἂν ἐγώ γε καὶ ἄλγεα πολλὰ μογήσας οἴκαδέ τʼ ἐλθέμεναι καὶ νόστιμον ἦμαρ ἰδέσθαι, ἢ ἐλθὼν ἀπολέσθαι ἐφέστιος, ὡς Ἀγαμέμνων ὤλεθʼ ὑπʼ Αἰγίσθοιο δόλῳ καὶ ἧς ἀλόχοιο. ἀλλʼ ἦ τοι θάνατον μὲν ὁμοίιον οὐδὲ θεοί περ καὶ φίλῳ ἀνδρὶ δύνανται ἀλαλκέμεν, ὁππότε κεν δὴ μοῖρʼ ὀλοὴ καθέλῃσι τανηλεγέος θανάτοιο. τὴν δʼ αὖ Τηλέμαχος πεπνυμένος ἀντίον ηὔδα·
"""Mentor,"" answered Telemakhos, ""do not let us talk about it any more. There is no chance of my father's ever coming back  ; the gods have long since counseled his destruction. There is something else, however, about which I should like to ask Nestor, for he knows much more than any one else does. They say he has reigned for three generations so that it is like talking to an immortal. Tell me, therefore, Nestor, and tell me true  ; how did Agamemnon come to die in that way? What was Menelaos doing? And how came false Aigisthos to kill so far better a man than himself? Was Menelaos away from Achaean Argos, voyaging elsewhere among humankind, that Aigisthos took heart and killed Agamemnon?"""

"""I will tell you truly  ,"" answered Nestor, ""and indeed you have yourself divined how it all happened. If Menelaos when he got back from Troy had found Aigisthos still alive in his house, there would have been no grave marker heaped up for him, not even when he was dead, but he would have been thrown outside the city to dogs and vultures, and not a woman would have mourned him, for he had done a deed of great wickedness; but we were over there, fighting hard   at Troy , and Aigisthos who was taking his ease quietly in the heart of Argos , cajoled Agamemnon's wife Clytemnestra with incessant flattery."	τοιγὰρ ἐγώ τοι, τέκνον, ἀληθέα πάντʼ ἀγορεύσω. ἦ τοι μὲν τάδε καὐτὸς ὀίεαι, ὥς κεν ἐτύχθη, εἰ ζωόν γʼ Αἴγισθον ἐνὶ μεγάροισιν ἔτετμεν Ἀτρεΐδης Τροίηθεν ἰών, ξανθὸς Μενέλαος· τῶ κέ οἱ οὐδὲ θανόντι χυτὴν ἐπὶ γαῖαν ἔχευαν, ἀλλʼ ἄρα τόν γε κύνες τε καὶ οἰωνοὶ κατέδαψαν κείμενον ἐν πεδίῳ ἑκὰς ἄστεος, οὐδέ κέ τίς μιν κλαῦσεν Ἀχαιιάδων· μάλα γὰρ μέγα μήσατο ἔργον. ἡμεῖς μὲν γὰρ κεῖθι πολέας τελέοντες ἀέθλους ἥμεθʼ· ὁ δʼ εὔκηλος μυχῷ Ἄργεος ἱπποβότοιο πόλλʼ Ἀγαμεμνονέην ἄλοχον θέλγεσκʼ ἐπέεσσιν.
"""At first she would have nothing to do with his wicked scheme, for she was of a good natural disposition; moreover there was a singer with her, to whom Agamemnon had given strict orders on setting out for Troy , that he was to keep guard over his wife; but when heaven had counseled her destruction, Aigisthos led this bard off to a desert island and left him there for crows and seagulls to batten upon - after which she went willingly enough to the house of Aigisthos. Then he offered many burnt sacrifices to the gods, and decorated many temples with tapestries and gilding, for he had succeeded far beyond his expectations."	ἡ δʼ ἦ τοι τὸ πρὶν μὲν ἀναίνετο ἔργον ἀεικὲς δῖα Κλυταιμνήστρη· φρεσὶ γὰρ κέχρητʼ ἀγαθῇσι· πὰρ δʼ ἄρʼ ἔην καὶ ἀοιδὸς ἀνήρ, ᾧ πόλλʼ ἐπέτελλεν Ἀτρεΐδης Τροίηνδε κιὼν εἴρυσθαι ἄκοιτιν. ἀλλʼ ὅτε δή μιν μοῖρα θεῶν ἐπέδησε δαμῆναι, δὴ τότε τὸν μὲν ἀοιδὸν ἄγων ἐς νῆσον ἐρήμην κάλλιπεν οἰωνοῖσιν ἕλωρ καὶ κύρμα γενέσθαι, τὴν δʼ ἐθέλων ἐθέλουσαν ἀνήγαγεν ὅνδε δόμονδε. πολλὰ δὲ μηρίʼ ἔκηε θεῶν ἱεροῖς ἐπὶ βωμοῖς, πολλὰ δʼ ἀγάλματʼ ἀνῆψεν, ὑφάσματά τε χρυσόν τε, ἐκτελέσας μέγα ἔργον, ὃ οὔ ποτε ἔλπετο θυμῷ.
"""Meanwhile Menelaos and I were on our way home from Troy , on good terms with one another. When we got to Sounion , which is the point of Athens , Apollo with his painless shafts killed Phrontis the steersman of Menelaos' ship (and never man knew better how to handle a vessel in rough weather) so that he died then and there with the helm in his hand, and Menelaos, though very anxious to press forward, had to wait in order to bury his comrade and give him his due funeral rites. Presently, when he too could put to sea again, and had sailed on as far as the Malean heads, Zeus counseled evil against him and made it blow hard till the waves ran mountains high. Here he divided his fleet and took the one half towards Crete where the Cydonians dwell round about the waters of the river Iardanos. There is a high headland hereabouts stretching out into the sea from a place called Gortyn , and all along this part of the coast as far as Phaistos the sea runs high when there is a south wind blowing, but past Phaistos the coast is more protected, for a small headland can make a great shelter. Here this part of the fleet was driven on to the rocks and wrecked; but the crews just managed to save themselves. As for the other five ships, they were taken by winds and seas to Egypt , where Menelaos gathered much gold and substance among people of an alien speech. Meanwhile Aigisthos here at home plotted his evil deed. For seven years after he had killed Agamemnon he ruled in Mycenae , and the people were obedient under him, but in the eighth year Orestes came back from Athens to be his bane, and killed the murderer of his father. Then he celebrated the funeral rites of his mother and of false Aigisthos by a banquet to the people of Argos , and on that very day Menelaos came home, with as much treasure as his ships could carry."	ἡμεῖς μὲν γὰρ ἅμα πλέομεν Τροίηθεν ἰόντες, Ἀτρεΐδης καὶ ἐγώ, φίλα εἰδότες ἀλλήλοισιν· ἀλλʼ ὅτε Σούνιον ἱρὸν ἀφικόμεθʼ, ἄκρον Ἀθηνέων, ἔνθα κυβερνήτην Μενελάου Φοῖβος Ἀπόλλων οἷς ἀγανοῖς βελέεσσιν ἐποιχόμενος κατέπεφνε, πηδάλιον μετὰ χερσὶ θεούσης νηὸς ἔχοντα, Φρόντιν Ὀνητορίδην, ὃς ἐκαίνυτο φῦλʼ ἀνθρώπων νῆα κυβερνῆσαι, ὁπότε σπέρχοιεν ἄελλαι. ὣς ὁ μὲν ἔνθα κατέσχετʼ, ἐπειγόμενός περ ὁδοῖο, ὄφρʼ ἕταρον θάπτοι καὶ ἐπὶ κτέρεα κτερίσειεν. ἀλλʼ ὅτε δὴ καὶ κεῖνος ἰὼν ἐπὶ οἴνοπα πόντον ἐν νηυσὶ γλαφυρῇσι Μαλειάων ὄρος αἰπὺ ἷξε θέων, τότε δὴ στυγερὴν ὁδὸν εὐρύοπα Ζεὺς ἐφράσατο, λιγέων δʼ ἀνέμων ἐπʼ ἀυτμένα χεῦε, κύματά τε τροφέοντο πελώρια, ἶσα ὄρεσσιν. ἔνθα διατμήξας τὰς μὲν Κρήτῃ ἐπέλασσεν, ἧχι Κύδωνες ἔναιον Ἰαρδάνου ἀμφὶ ῥέεθρα. ἔστι δέ τις λισσὴ αἰπεῖά τε εἰς ἅλα πέτρη ἐσχατιῇ Γόρτυνος ἐν ἠεροειδέι πόντῳ· ἔνθα Νότος μέγα κῦμα ποτὶ σκαιὸν ῥίον ὠθεῖ, ἐς Φαιστόν, μικρὸς δὲ λίθος μέγα κῦμʼ ἀποέργει. αἱ μὲν ἄρʼ ἔνθʼ ἦλθον, σπουδῇ δʼ ἤλυξαν ὄλεθρον ἄνδρες, ἀτὰρ νῆάς γε ποτὶ σπιλάδεσσιν ἔαξαν κύματʼ· ἀτὰρ τὰς πέντε νέας κυανοπρῳρείους Αἰγύπτῳ ἐπέλασσε φέρων ἄνεμός τε καὶ ὕδωρ. ὣς ὁ μὲν ἔνθα πολὺν βίοτον καὶ χρυσὸν ἀγείρων ἠλᾶτο ξὺν νηυσὶ κατʼ ἀλλοθρόους ἀνθρώπους· τόφρα δὲ ταῦτʼ Αἴγισθος ἐμήσατο οἴκοθι λυγρά. ἑπτάετες δʼ ἤνασσε πολυχρύσοιο Μυκήνης, κτείνας Ἀτρεΐδην, δέδμητο δὲ λαὸς ὑπʼ αὐτῷ. τῷ δέ οἱ ὀγδοάτῳ κακὸν ἤλυθε δῖος Ὀρέστης ἂψ ἀπʼ Ἀθηνάων, κατὰ δʼ ἔκτανε πατροφονῆα, Αἴγισθον δολόμητιν, ὅ οἱ πατέρα κλυτὸν ἔκτα. ἦ τοι ὁ τὸν κτείνας δαίνυ τάφον Ἀργείοισιν μητρός τε στυγερῆς καὶ ἀνάλκιδος Αἰγίσθοιο· αὐτῆμαρ δέ οἱ ἦλθε βοὴν ἀγαθὸς Μενέλαος πολλὰ κτήματʼ ἄγων, ὅσα οἱ νέες ἄχθος ἄειραν.
"""Take my advice then, and do not go traveling about for long so far from home, nor leave your property with such dangerous people in your house; they will eat up everything you have among them, and you will have been on a fool's errand. Still, I should advise you by all means to go and visit Menelaos, who has lately come off a voyage among such distant peoples as no man could ever hope to get back from, when the winds had once carried him so far out of his reckoning; even birds cannot fly the distance in a twelvemonth, so vast and terrible are the seas that they must cross. Go to him, therefore, by sea, and take your own men with you; or if you would rather travel by land you can have a chariot, you can have horses, and here are my sons who can escort you to Lacedaemon where Menelaos lives.

"As he spoke the sun set and it came on dark, whereon Athena said, ""Sir, all that you have said is well; now, however, order the tongues of the victims to be cut, and mix wine that we may make drink-offerings to Poseidon, and the other immortals, and then go to bed, for it is bed time  . People should go away early and not keep late hours at a religious festival."""	ὣς ἔφατʼ, ἠέλιος δʼ ἄρʼ ἔδυ καὶ ἐπὶ κνέφας ἦλθε. τοῖσι δὲ καὶ μετέειπε θεά, γλαυκῶπις Ἀθήνη· ὦ γέρον, ἦ τοι ταῦτα κατὰ μοῖραν κατέλεξας· ἀλλʼ ἄγε τάμνετε μὲν γλώσσας, κεράασθε δὲ οἶνον, ὄφρα Ποσειδάωνι καὶ ἄλλοις ἀθανάτοισιν σπείσαντες κοίτοιο μεδώμεθα· τοῖο γὰρ ὥρη. ἤδη γὰρ φάος οἴχεθʼ ὑπὸ ζόφον, οὐδὲ ἔοικεν· δηθὰ θεῶν ἐν δαιτὶ θαασσέμεν, ἀλλὰ νέεσθαι.
Thus spoke the daughter of Zeus, and they obeyed her saying. Men servants poured water over the hands of the guests, while pages filled the mixing-bowls with wine and water, and handed it round after giving every man his drink-offering; then they threw the tongues of the victims into the fire, and stood up to make their drink-offerings. When they had made their offerings and had drunk each as much as he was minded, Athena and Telemakhos were for going on board their ship, but Nestor caught them up at once and stayed them.	ἦ ῥα Διὸς θυγάτηρ, οἱ δʼ ἔκλυον αὐδησάσης. τοῖσι δὲ κήρυκες μὲν ὕδωρ ἐπὶ χεῖρας ἔχευαν, κοῦροι δὲ κρητῆρας ἐπεστέψαντο ποτοῖο, νώμησαν δʼ ἄρα πᾶσιν ἐπαρξάμενοι δεπάεσσι· γλώσσας δʼ ἐν πυρὶ βάλλον, ἀνιστάμενοι δʼ ἐπέλειβον. αὐτὰρ ἐπεὶ σπεῖσάν τʼ ἔπιον θʼ, ὅσον ἤθελε θυμός, δὴ τότʼ Ἀθηναίη καὶ Τηλέμαχος θεοειδὴς ἄμφω ἱέσθην κοίλην ἐπὶ νῆα νέεσθαι.

Do you think I am so poor and short of clothes, or that I have so few cloaks and as to be unable to find comfortable beds both for myself and for my guests? Let me tell you I have store both of rugs and cloaks, and shall not permit the son of my old friend Odysseus to camp down on the deck of a ship - not while I live - nor yet will my sons after me, but they will keep open house as I have done."""

"Then Athena answered, ""Sir, you have spoken well, and it will be much better that Telemakhos should do as you have said; he, therefore, shall return with you and sleep at your house, but I must go back to give orders to my crew, and keep them in good heart. I am the only older person among them; the rest are all young men of Telemakhos' own age, who have taken this voyage out of friendship; so I must return to the ship and sleep there. Moreover tomorrow I must go to the Cauconians where I have a large sum of wealth long owed to me. As for Telemakhos, now that he is your guest, send him to Lacedaemon in a chariot, and let one of your sons go with him. Be pleased also to provide him with your best and fleetest horses."""	τὸν δʼ αὖτε προσέειπε θεά, γλαυκῶπις Ἀθήνη· εὖ δὴ ταῦτά γʼ ἔφησθα, γέρον φίλε· σοὶ δὲ ἔοικεν Τηλέμαχον πείθεσθαι, ἐπεὶ πολὺ κάλλιον οὕτως. ἀλλʼ οὗτος μὲν νῦν σοὶ ἅμʼ ἕψεται, ὄφρα κεν εὕδῃ σοῖσιν ἐνὶ μεγάροισιν· ἐγὼ δʼ ἐπὶ νῆα μέλαιναν εἶμʼ, ἵνα θαρσύνω θʼ ἑτάρους εἴπω τε ἕκαστα. οἶος γὰρ μετὰ τοῖσι γεραίτερος εὔχομαι εἶναι· οἱ δʼ ἄλλοι φιλότητι νεώτεροι ἄνδρες ἕπονται, πάντες ὁμηλικίη μεγαθύμου Τηλεμάχοιο. ἔνθα κε λεξαίμην κοίλῃ παρὰ νηὶ μελαίνῃ νῦν· ἀτὰρ ἠῶθεν μετὰ Καύκωνας μεγαθύμους εἶμʼ ἔνθα χρεῖός μοι ὀφέλλεται, οὔ τι νέον γε οὐδʼ ὀλίγον. σὺ δὲ τοῦτον, ἐπεὶ τεὸν ἵκετο δῶμα, πέμψον σὺν δίφρῳ τε καὶ υἱέι· δὸς δέ οἱ ἵππους, οἵ τοι ἐλαφρότατοι θείειν καὶ κάρτος ἄριστοι.
"When she had thus spoken, she flew away in the form of an eagle, and all marveled as they beheld it. Nestor was astonished, and took Telemakhos by the hand. ""My friend,"" said he, ""I see that you are going to be a great hero some day, since the gods wait upon you thus while you are still so young. This can have been none other of those who dwell in heaven than Zeus' redoubtable daughter, the Trito-born, who showed such favor towards your brave father among the Argives."" ""Holy queen,"" he continued, ""agree to send down noble upon myself, my good wife, and my children. In return, I will offer you in sacrifice a broad-browed heifer of a year old, unbroken, and never yet brought by man under the yoke. I will gild her horns, and will offer her up to you in sacrifice."""	ὣς ἄρα φωνήσασʼ ἀπέβη γλαυκῶπις Ἀθήνη φήνῃ εἰδομένη· θάμβος δʼ ἕλε πάντας ἰδόντας. θαύμαζεν δʼ ὁ γεραιός, ὅπως ἴδεν ὀφθαλμοῖς· Τηλεμάχου δʼ ἕλε χεῖρα, ἔπος τʼ ἔφατʼ ἔκ τʼ ὀνόμαζεν· ὦ φίλος, οὔ σε ἔολπα κακὸν καὶ ἄναλκιν ἔσεσθαι, εἰ δή τοι νέῳ ὧδε θεοὶ πομπῆες ἕπονται. οὐ μὲν γάρ τις ὅδʼ ἄλλος Ὀλύμπια δώματʼ ἐχόντων, ἀλλὰ Διὸς θυγάτηρ, κυδίστη Τριτογένεια, ἥ τοι καὶ πατέρʼ ἐσθλὸν ἐν Ἀργείοισιν ἐτίμα. ἀλλὰ ἄνασσʼ ἵληθι, δίδωθι δέ μοι κλέος ἐσθλόν, αὐτῷ καὶ παίδεσσι καὶ αἰδοίῃ παρακοίτι· σοὶ δʼ αὖ ἐγὼ ῥέξω βοῦν ἦνιν εὐρυμέτωπον ἀδμήτην, ἣν οὔ πω ὑπὸ ζυγὸν ἤγαγεν ἀνήρ· τήν τοι ἐγὼ ῥέξω χρυσὸν κέρασιν περιχεύας.
Thus did he pray, and Athena heard his prayer. He then led the way to his own house, followed by his sons and sons-in-law. When they had got there and had taken their places on the benches and seats, he mixed them a bowl of sweet wine that was eleven years old when the housekeeper took the lid off the jar that held it. As he mixed the wine, he prayed much and made drink-offerings to Athena, daughter of Aegis-bearing Zeus. Then, when they had made their drink-offerings and had drunk each as much as he was minded, the others went home to bed each in his own abode; but Nestor put Telemakhos to sleep in the room that was over the gateway along with Peisistratos, who was the only unmarried son now left him. As for himself, he slept in an inner room of the house, with the queen his wife by his side.	ὣς ἔφατʼ εὐχόμενος, τοῦ δʼ ἔκλυε Παλλὰς Ἀθήνη. τοῖσιν δʼ ἡγεμόνευε Γερήνιος ἱππότα Νέστωρ, υἱάσι καὶ γαμβροῖσιν, ἑὰ πρὸς δώματα καλά. ἀλλʼ ὅτε δώμαθʼ ἵκοντο ἀγακλυτὰ τοῖο ἄνακτος, ἑξείης ἕζοντο κατὰ κλισμούς τε θρόνους τε· τοῖς δʼ ὁ γέρων ἐλθοῦσιν ἀνὰ κρητῆρα κέρασσεν οἴνου ἡδυπότοιο, τὸν ἑνδεκάτῳ ἐνιαυτῷ ὤιξεν ταμίη καὶ ἀπὸ κρήδεμνον ἔλυσε· τοῦ ὁ γέρων κρητῆρα κεράσσατο, πολλὰ δʼ Ἀθήνῃ εὔχετʼ ἀποσπένδων, κούρῃ Διὸς αἰγιόχοιο. αὐτὰρ ἐπεὶ σπεῖσάν τʼ ἔπιον θʼ, ὅσον ἤθελε θυμός, οἱ μὲν κακκείοντες ἔβαν οἶκόνδε ἕκαστος, τὸν δʼ αὐτοῦ κοίμησε Γερήνιος ἱππότα Νέστωρ, Τηλέμαχον, φίλον υἱὸν Ὀδυσσῆος θείοιο, τρητοῖς ἐν λεχέεσσιν ὑπʼ αἰθούσῃ ἐριδούπῳ, πὰρʼ δʼ ἄρʼ ἐυμμελίην Πεισίστρατον, ὄρχαμον ἀνδρῶν, ὅς οἱ ἔτʼ ἠίθεος παίδων ἦν ἐν μεγάροισιν· αὐτὸς δʼ αὖτε καθεῦδε μυχῷ δόμου ὑψηλοῖο, τῷ δʼ ἄλοχος δέσποινα λέχος πόρσυνε καὶ εὐνήν.
Now when the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared, Nestor left his couch and took his seat on the benches of white and polished marble that stood in front of his house. Here aforetime sat Neleus, peer of gods in counsel, but he was now dead, and had gone to the house of Hades; so Nestor sat in his seat, scepter in hand, as guardian of the public weal. His sons as they left their rooms gathered round him, Echephron, Stratios, Perseus, Aretos, and Thrasymedes; the sixth son was Peisistratos, and when Telemakhos joined them they made him sit with them. Nestor then addressed them.	ἦμος δʼ ἠριγένεια φάνη ῥοδοδάκτυλος Ἠώς, ὤρνυτʼ ἄρʼ ἐξ εὐνῆφι Γερήνιος ἱππότα Νέστωρ, ἐκ δʼ ἐλθὼν κατʼ ἄρʼ ἕζετʼ ἐπὶ ξεστοῖσι λίθοισιν, οἵ οἱ ἔσαν προπάροιθε θυράων ὑψηλάων, λευκοί, ἀποστίλβοντες ἀλείφατος· οἷς ἔπι μὲν πρὶν Νηλεὺς ἵζεσκεν, θεόφιν μήστωρ ἀτάλαντος· ἀλλʼ ὁ μὲν ἤδη κηρὶ δαμεὶς Ἄϊδόσδε βεβήκει, Νέστωρ αὖ τότʼ ἐφῖζε Γερήνιος, οὖρος Ἀχαιῶν, σκῆπτρον ἔχων. περὶ δʼ υἷες ἀολλέες ἠγερέθοντο ἐκ θαλάμων ἐλθόντες, Ἐχέφρων τε Στρατίος τε Περσεύς τʼ Ἄρητός τε καὶ ἀντίθεος Θρασυμήδης. τοῖσι δʼ ἔπειθʼ ἕκτος Πεισίστρατος ἤλυθεν ἥρως, πὰρ δʼ ἄρα Τηλέμαχον θεοείκελον εἷσαν ἄγοντες. τοῖσι δὲ μύθων ἦρχε Γερήνιος ἱππότα Νέστωρ·
"""My sons,"" said he, ""make haste to do as I shall bid you. I wish first and foremost to propitiate the great goddess Athena, who manifested herself visibly to me during yesterday's festivities. Go, then, one or other of you to the plain, tell the stockman to look me out a heifer, and come on here with it at once. Another must go to Telemakhos' ship, and invite all the crew, leaving two men only in charge of the vessel. Some one else will run and fetch Laerceus the goldsmith to gild the horns of the heifer. The rest, stay all of you where you are; tell the maids in the house to prepare an excellent dinner, and to fetch seats, and logs of wood for a burnt offering. Tell them also to bring me some clear spring water."""	καρπαλίμως μοι, τέκνα φίλα, κρηήνατʼ ἐέλδωρ, ὄφρʼ ἦ τοι πρώτιστα θεῶν ἱλάσσομʼ Ἀθήνην, ἥ μοι ἐναργὴς ἦλθε θεοῦ ἐς δαῖτα θάλειαν. ἀλλʼ ἄγʼ ὁ μὲν πεδίονδʼ ἐπὶ βοῦν, ἴτω, ὄφρα τάχιστα ἔλθῃσιν, ἐλάσῃ δὲ βοῶν ἐπιβουκόλος ἀνήρ· εἷς δʼ ἐπὶ Τηλεμάχου μεγαθύμου νῆα μέλαιναν πάντας ἰὼν ἑτάρους ἀγέτω, λιπέτω δὲ δύʼ οἴους· εἷς δʼ αὖ χρυσοχόον Λαέρκεα δεῦρο κελέσθω ἐλθεῖν, ὄφρα βοὸς χρυσὸν κέρασιν περιχεύῃ. οἱ δʼ ἄλλοι μένετʼ αὐτοῦ ἀολλέες, εἴπατε δʼ εἴσω δμῳῇσιν κατὰ δώματʼ ἀγακλυτὰ δαῖτα πένεσθαι, ἕδρας τε ξύλα τʼ ἀμφὶ καὶ ἀγλαὸν οἰσέμεν ὕδωρ.
On this they hurried off on their several errands. The heifer was brought in from the plain, and Telemakhos' crew came from the ship; the goldsmith brought the anvil, hammer, and tongs, with which he worked his gold, and Athena herself came to the sacrifice. Nestor gave out the gold, and the smith gilded the horns of the heifer that the goddess might have pleasure in their beauty. Then Stratios and Echephron brought her in by the horns; Aretos fetched water from the house in a ewer that had a flower pattern on it, and in his other hand he held a basket of barley meal; sturdy Thrasymedes stood by with a sharp axe, ready to strike the heifer, while Perseus held a bucket. Then Nestor began with washing his hands and sprinkling the barley meal, and he offered many a prayer to Athena as he threw a lock from the heifer's head upon the fire.	ὣς ἔφαθʼ, οἱ δʼ ἄρα πάντες ἐποίπνυον. ἦλθε μὲν ἂρ βοῦς ἐκ πεδίου, ἦλθον δὲ θοῆς παρὰ νηὸς ἐίσης Τηλεμάχου ἕταροι μεγαλήτορος, ἦλθε δὲ χαλκεὺς ὅπλʼ ἐν χερσὶν ἔχων χαλκήια, πείρατα τέχνης, ἄκμονά τε σφῦραν τʼ ἐυποίητόν τε πυράγρην, οἷσίν τε χρυσὸν εἰργάζετο· ἦλθε δʼ Ἀθήνη ἱρῶν ἀντιόωσα. γέρων δʼ ἱππηλάτα Νέστωρ χρυσὸν ἔδωχʼ· ὁ δʼ ἔπειτα βοὸς κέρασιν περίχευεν ἀσκήσας, ἵνʼ ἄγαλμα θεὰ κεχάροιτο ἰδοῦσα. βοῦν δʼ ἀγέτην κεράων Στρατίος καὶ δῖος Ἐχέφρων. χέρνιβα δέ σφʼ Ἄρητος ἐν ἀνθεμόεντι λέβητι ἤλυθεν ἐκ θαλάμοιο φέρων, ἑτέρῃ δʼ ἔχεν οὐλὰς ἐν κανέῳ πέλεκυν δὲ μενεπτόλεμος Θρασυμήδης ὀξὺν ἔχων ἐν χειρὶ παρίστατο βοῦν ἐπικόψων. Περσεὺς δʼ ἀμνίον εἶχε· γέρων δʼ ἱππηλάτα Νέστωρ χέρνιβά τʼ οὐλοχύτας τε κατήρχετο, πολλὰ δʼ Ἀθήνῃ εὔχετʼ ἀπαρχόμενος, κεφαλῆς τρίχας ἐν πυρὶ βάλλων.
When they had done praying and sprinkling the barley meal Thrasymedes dealt his blow, and brought the heifer down with a stroke that cut through the tendons at the base of her neck, whereon the daughters and daughters-in-law of Nestor, and his venerable wife Eurydice (she was eldest daughter to Klymenos) screamed with delight. Then they lifted the heifer's head from off the ground, and Peisistratos cut her throat. When she had done bleeding and was quite dead, they cut her up. They cut out the thigh bones all in due course, wrapped them round in two layers of fat, and set some pieces of raw meat on the top of them; then Nestor laid them upon the wood fire and poured wine over them, while the young men stood near him with five-pronged spits in their hands. When the thighs were burned and they had tasted the inward meats, they cut the rest of the meat up small, put the pieces on the spits and toasted them over the fire.	αὐτὰρ ἐπεί ῥʼ εὔξαντο καὶ οὐλοχύτας προβάλοντο, αὐτίκα Νέστορος υἱὸς ὑπέρθυμος Θρασυμήδης ἤλασεν ἄγχι στάς· πέλεκυς δʼ ἀπέκοψε τένοντας αὐχενίους, λῦσεν δὲ βοὸς μένος. αἱ δʼ ὀλόλυξαν θυγατέρες τε νυοί τε καὶ αἰδοίη παράκοιτις Νέστορος, Εὐρυδίκη, πρέσβα Κλυμένοιο θυγατρῶν. οἱ μὲν ἔπειτʼ ἀνελόντες ἀπὸ χθονὸς εὐρυοδείης ἔσχον· ἀτὰρ σφάξεν Πεισίστρατος, ὄρχαμος ἀνδρῶν. τῆς δʼ ἐπεὶ ἐκ μέλαν αἷμα ῥύη, λίπε δʼ ὀστέα θυμός, αἶψʼ ἄρα μιν διέχευαν, ἄφαρ δʼ ἐκ μηρία τάμνον πάντα κατὰ μοῖραν, κατά τε κνίσῃ ἐκάλυψαν δίπτυχα ποιήσαντες, ἐπʼ αὐτῶν δʼ ὠμοθέτησαν. καῖε δʼ ἐπὶ σχίζῃς ὁ γέρων, ἐπὶ δʼ αἴθοπα οἶνον λεῖβε· νέοι δὲ παρʼ αὐτὸν ἔχον πεμπώβολα χερσίν. αὐτὰρ ἐπεὶ κατὰ μῆρʼ ἐκάη καὶ σπλάγχνα πάσαντο, μίστυλλόν τʼ ἄρα τἆλλα καὶ ἀμφʼ ὀβελοῖσιν ἔπειραν, ὤπτων δʼ ἀκροπόρους ὀβελοὺς ἐν χερσὶν ἔχοντες.
"Meanwhile lovely Polykaste, Nestor's youngest daughter, washed Telemakhos. When she had washed him and anointed him with oil, she brought him a fair mantle and shirt, and he looked like a god as he came from the bath and took his seat by the side of Nestor. When the outer meats were done they drew them off the spits and sat down to dinner where they were waited upon by some worthy henchmen, who kept pouring them out their wine in cups of gold. As soon as they had had enough to eat and drink Nestor said, ""Sons, put Telemakhos' horses to the chariot that he may start at once."""	τόφρα δὲ Τηλέμαχον λοῦσεν καλὴ Πολυκάστη, Νέστορος ὁπλοτάτη θυγάτηρ Νηληϊάδαο. αὐτὰρ ἐπεὶ λοῦσέν τε καὶ ἔχρισεν λίπʼ ἐλαίῳ, ἀμφὶ δέ μιν φᾶρος καλὸν βάλεν ἠδὲ χιτῶνα, ἔκ ῥʼ ἀσαμίνθου βῆ δέμας ἀθανάτοισιν ὁμοῖος· πὰρ δʼ ὅ γε Νέστορʼ ἰὼν κατʼ ἄρʼ ἕζετο, ποιμένα λαῶν. οἱ δʼ ἐπεὶ ὤπτησαν κρέʼ ὑπέρτερα καὶ ἐρύσαντο, δαίνυνθʼ ἑζόμενοι· ἐπὶ δʼ ἀνέρες ἐσθλοὶ ὄροντο οἶνον οἰνοχοεῦντες ἐνὶ χρυσέοις δεπάεσσιν. αὐτὰρ ἐπεὶ πόσιος καὶ ἐδητύος ἐξ ἔρον ἕντο, τοῖσι δὲ μύθων ἦρχε Γερήνιος ἱππότα Νέστωρ· παῖδες ἐμοί, ἄγε Τηλεμάχῳ καλλίτριχας ἵππους ζεύξαθʼ ὑφʼ ἅρματʼ ἄγοντες, ἵνα πρήσσῃσιν ὁδοῖο.
Thus did he speak, and they did even as he had said, and yoked the fleet horses to the chariot. The housekeeper packed them up a provision of bread, wine, and sweetmeats fit for the sons of princes. Then Telemakhos got into the chariot, while Peisistratos gathered up the reins and took his seat beside him. He lashed the horses on and they flew forward nothing loath into the open country, leaving the high citadel of Pylos behind them. All that day did they travel, swaying the yoke upon their necks till the sun went down and darkness was over all the land. Then they reached Pherai where Diokles lived, who was son to Ortilokhos and grandson to Alpheus. Here they passed the night and Diokles entertained them hospitably. When the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn; appeared, they again yoked their horses and drove out through the gateway under the echoing gatehouse. Peisistratos lashed the horses on and they flew forward nothing loath; presently they came to the wheat lands of the open country, and in the course of time completed their journey, so well did their steeds take them.	ὣς ἔφαθʼ, οἱ δʼ ἄρα τοῦ μάλα μὲν κλύον ἠδʼ ἐπίθοντο, καρπαλίμως δʼ ἔζευξαν ὑφʼ ἅρμασιν ὠκέας ἵππους. ἐν δὲ γυνὴ ταμίη σῖτον καὶ οἶνον ἔθηκεν ὄψα τε, οἷα ἔδουσι διοτρεφέες βασιλῆες. ἂν δʼ ἄρα Τηλέμαχος περικαλλέα βήσετο δίφρον· πὰρ δʼ ἄρα Νεστορίδης Πεισίστρατος, ὄρχαμος ἀνδρῶν, ἐς δίφρον τʼ ἀνέβαινε καὶ ἡνία λάζετο χερσί, μάστιξεν δʼ ἐλάαν, τὼ δʼ οὐκ ἀέκοντε πετέσθην ἐς πεδίον, λιπέτην δὲ Πύλου αἰπὺ πτολίεθρον. οἱ δὲ πανημέριοι σεῖον ζυγὸν ἀμφὶς ἔχοντες. δύσετό τʼ ἠέλιος σκιόωντό τε πᾶσαι ἀγυιαί, ἐς Φηρὰς δʼ ἵκοντο Διοκλῆος ποτὶ δῶμα, υἱέος Ὀρτιλόχοιο, τὸν Ἀλφειὸς τέκε παῖδα. ἔνθα δὲ νύκτʼ ἄεσαν, ὁ δὲ τοῖς πὰρ ξείνια θῆκεν. ἦμος δʼ ἠριγένεια φάνη ῥοδοδάκτυλος Ἠώς, ἵππους τε ζεύγνυντʼ ἀνά θʼ ἅρματα ποικίλʼ ἔβαινον· ἐκ δʼ ἔλασαν προθύροιο καὶ αἰθούσης ἐριδούπου· μάστιξεν δʼ ἐλάαν, τὼ δʼ οὐκ ἀέκοντε πετέσθην. ἷξον δʼ ἐς πεδίον πυρηφόρον, ἔνθα δʼ ἔπειτα ἦνον ὁδόν· τοῖον γὰρ ὑπέκφερον ὠκέες ἵπποι.
Now when the sun had set and darkness was over the land,	δύσετό τʼ ἠέλιος σκιόωντό τε πᾶσαι ἀγυιαί.
They reached the low lying city of Lacedaemon , where they drove straight to the halls of Menelaos. They found him in his own house, feasting with his many clansmen in honor of the wedding of his son, and also of his daughter, whom he was marrying to the son of that valiant warrior Achilles. He had given his consent and promised her to him while he was still at Troy , and now the gods were bringing the marriage about; so he was sending her with chariots and horses to the city of the Myrmidons over whom Achilles’ son was reigning. For his only son he had found a bride from Sparta , daughter of Alektor. This son, Megapenthes, was born to him of a bondwoman, for heaven granted Helen no more children after she had borne Hermione, who was fair as golden Aphrodite herself.	οἱ δʼ ἷξον κοίλην Λακεδαίμονα κητώεσσαν, πρὸς δʼ ἄρα δώματʼ ἔλων Μενελάου κυδαλίμοιο. τὸν δʼ εὗρον δαινύντα γάμον πολλοῖσιν ἔτῃσιν υἱέος ἠδὲ θυγατρὸς ἀμύμονος ᾧ ἐνὶ οἴκῳ. τὴν μὲν Ἀχιλλῆος ῥηξήνορος υἱέι πέμπεν· ἐν Τροίῃ γὰρ πρῶτον ὑπέσχετο καὶ κατένευσε δωσέμεναι, τοῖσιν δὲ θεοὶ γάμον ἐξετέλειον. τὴν ἄρʼ ὅ γʼ ἔνθʼ ἵπποισι καὶ ἅρμασι πέμπε νέεσθαι Μυρμιδόνων προτὶ ἄστυ περικλυτόν, οἷσιν ἄνασσεν. υἱέι δὲ Σπάρτηθεν Ἀλέκτορος ἤγετο κούρην, ὅς οἱ τηλύγετος γένετο κρατερὸς Μεγαπένθης ἐκ δούλης· Ἑλένῃ δὲ θεοὶ γόνον οὐκέτʼ ἔφαινον, ἐπεὶ δὴ τὸ πρῶτον ἐγείνατο παῖδʼ ἐρατεινήν, Ἑρμιόνην, ἣ εἶδος ἔχε χρυσέης Ἀφροδίτης.
So the neighbors and kinsmen of Menelaos were feasting and making merry in his house. There was a singer also to sing to them and play his lyre, while two tumblers went about performing in the midst of them when the man struck up with his tune.	ὣς οἱ μὲν δαίνυντο καθʼ ὑψερεφὲς μέγα δῶμα γείτονες ἠδὲ ἔται Μενελάου κυδαλίμοιο, τερπόμενοι· μετὰ δέ σφιν ἐμέλπετο θεῖος ἀοιδὸς φορμίζων, δοιὼ δὲ κυβιστητῆρε κατʼ αὐτούς, μολπῆς ἐξάρχοντος, ἐδίνευον κατὰ μέσσους.
"Telemakhos and the son of Nestor stayed their horses at the gate, whereon Eteoneus servant to Menelaos came out, and as soon as he saw them ran hurrying back into the house to tell his Master. He went close up to him and said, ""Menelaos, there are some strangers come here, two men, who look like sons of Zeus. What are we to do? Shall we take their horses out, or tell them to find friends elsewhere as they best can?"""	τὼ δʼ αὖτʼ ἐν προθύροισι δόμων αὐτώ τε καὶ ἵππω, Τηλέμαχός θʼ ἥρως καὶ Νέστορος ἀγλαὸς υἱός, στῆσαν· ὁ δὲ προμολὼν ἴδετο κρείων Ἐτεωνεύς, ὀτρηρὸς θεράπων Μενελάου κυδαλίμοιο, βῆ δʼ ἴμεν ἀγγελέων διὰ δώματα ποιμένι λαῶν, ἀγχοῦ δʼ ἱστάμενος ἔπεα πτερόεντα προσηύδα· ξείνω δή τινε τώδε, διοτρεφὲς ὦ Μενέλαε, ἄνδρε δύω, γενεῇ δὲ Διὸς μεγάλοιο ἔικτον. ἀλλʼ εἴπʼ, ἤ σφωιν καταλύσομεν ὠκέας ἵππους, ἦ ἄλλον πέμπωμεν ἱκανέμεν, ὅς κε φιλήσῃ.
"Menelaos was very angry and said, ""Eteoneus, son of Boethoos, you never used to be a fool, but now you talk like a simpleton. Take their horses out, of course, and show the strangers in that they may have supper; you and I have stayed often enough at other people's houses before we got back here, where heaven grant that we may rest in peace henceforward."""	τὸν δὲ μέγʼ ὀχθήσας προσέφη ξανθὸς Μενέλαος· οὐ μὲν νήπιος ἦσθα, Βοηθοΐδη Ἐτεωνεῦ, τὸ πρίν· ἀτὰρ μὲν νῦν γε πάϊς ὣς νήπια βάζεις. ἦ μὲν δὴ νῶι ξεινήια πολλὰ φαγόντε ἄλλων ἀνθρώπων δεῦρʼ ἱκόμεθʼ, αἴ κέ ποθι Ζεὺς ἐξοπίσω περ παύσῃ ὀιζύος. ἀλλὰ λύʼ ἵππους ξείνων, ἐς δʼ αὐτοὺς προτέρω ἄγε θοινηθῆναι.
So Eteoneus bustled back and bade other servants come with him. They took their sweating hands from under the yoke, made them fast to the mangers, and gave them a feed of oats and barley mixed. Then they leaned the chariot against the end wall of the courtyard, and led the way into the house. Telemakhos and Peisistratos were astonished when they saw it, for its splendor was as that of the sun and moon; then, when they had admired everything to their heart's content, they went into the bath room and washed themselves.	ὣς φάθʼ, ὁ δὲ μεγάροιο διέσσυτο, κέκλετο δʼ ἄλλους ὀτρηροὺς θεράποντας ἅμα σπέσθαι ἑοῖ αὐτῷ. οἱ δʼ ἵππους μὲν λῦσαν ὑπὸ ζυγοῦ ἱδρώοντας, καὶ τοὺς μὲν κατέδησαν ἐφʼ ἱππείῃσι κάπῃσι, πὰρ δʼ ἔβαλον ζειάς, ἀνὰ δὲ κρῖ λευκὸν ἔμιξαν, ἅρματα δʼ ἔκλιναν πρὸς ἐνώπια παμφανόωντα, αὐτοὺς δʼ εἰσῆγον θεῖον δόμον. οἱ δὲ ἰδόντες θαύμαζον κατὰ δῶμα διοτρεφέος βασιλῆος· ὥς τε γὰρ ἠελίου αἴγλη πέλεν ἠὲ σελήνης δῶμα καθʼ ὑψερεφὲς Μενελάου κυδαλίμοιο. αὐτὰρ ἐπεὶ τάρπησαν ὁρώμενοι ὀφθαλμοῖσιν, ἔς ῥʼ ἀσαμίνθους βάντες ἐυξέστας λούσαντο.
When the servants had washed them and anointed them with oil, they brought them woolen cloaks and shirts, and the two took their seats by the side of Menelaos. A maidservant brought them water in a beautiful golden ewer, and poured it into a silver basin for them to wash their hands; and she drew a clean table beside them. An upper servant brought them bread, and offered them many good things of what there was in the house, while the carver fetched them plates of all manner of meats and set cups of gold by their side.	τοὺς δʼ ἐπεὶ οὖν δμῳαὶ λοῦσαν καὶ χρῖσαν ἐλαίῳ, ἀμφὶ δʼ ἄρα χλαίνας οὔλας βάλον ἠδὲ χιτῶνας, ἔς ῥα θρόνους ἕζοντο παρʼ Ἀτρεΐδην Μενέλαον. χέρνιβα δʼ ἀμφίπολος προχόῳ ἐπέχευε φέρουσα καλῇ χρυσείῃ ὑπὲρ ἀργυρέοιο λέβητος, νίψασθαι· παρὰ δὲ ξεστὴν ἐτάνυσσε τράπεζαν. σῖτον δʼ αἰδοίη ταμίη παρέθηκε φέρουσα, εἴδατα πόλλʼ ἐπιθεῖσα, χαριζομένη παρεόντων. δαιτρὸς δὲ κρειῶν πίνακας παρέθηκεν ἀείρας παντοίων, παρὰ δέ σφι τίθει χρύσεια κύπελλα.
"Menelaos then greeted them saying, ""Eat up, and welcome; when you have finished supper I shall ask who you are, for the lineage of such men as you cannot have been lost. You must be descended from a line of scepter-bearing kings, for poor people do not have such sons as you are."""	τὼ καὶ δεικνύμενος προσέφη ξανθὸς Μενέλαος· σίτου θʼ ἅπτεσθον καὶ χαίρετον. αὐτὰρ ἔπειτα δείπνου πασσαμένω εἰρησόμεθʼ, οἵ τινές ἐστον ἀνδρῶν· οὐ γὰρ σφῷν γε γένος ἀπόλωλε τοκήων, ἀλλʼ ἀνδρῶν γένος ἐστὲ διοτρεφέων βασιλήων σκηπτούχων, ἐπεὶ οὔ κε κακοὶ τοιούσδε τέκοιεν.
"On this he handed them a piece of fat roast loin, which had been set near him as being a prime part, and they laid their hands on the good things that were before them; as soon as they had had enough to eat and drink, Telemakhos said to the son of Nestor, with his head so close that no one might hear, ""Look, Peisistratos, man after my own heart, see the gleam of bronze and gold - of amber, ivory, and silver. Everything is so splendid that it is like seeing the palace of Olympian Zeus. I am lost in admiration."""	ὣς φάτο, καί σφιν νῶτα βοὸς παρὰ πίονα θῆκεν ὄπτʼ ἐν χερσὶν ἑλών, τά ῥά οἱ γέρα πάρθεσαν αὐτῷ. οἱ δʼ ἐπʼ ὀνείαθʼ ἑτοῖμα προκείμενα χεῖρας ἴαλλον. αὐτὰρ ἐπεὶ πόσιος καὶ ἐδητύος ἐξ ἔρον ἕντο, δὴ τότε Τηλέμαχος προσεφώνεε Νέστορος υἱόν, ἄγχι σχὼν κεφαλήν, ἵνα μὴ πευθοίαθʼ οἱ ἄλλοι· φράζεο, Νεστορίδη, τῷ ἐμῷ κεχαρισμένε θυμῷ, χαλκοῦ τε στεροπὴν κὰδ δώματα ἠχήεντα χρυσοῦ τʼ ἠλέκτρου τε καὶ ἀργύρου ἠδʼ ἐλέφαντος. Ζηνός που τοιήδε γʼ Ὀλυμπίου ἔνδοθεν αὐλή, ὅσσα τάδʼ ἄσπετα πολλά· σέβας μʼ ἔχει εἰσορόωντα.
"Menelaos overheard him and said, ""No one, my sons, can hold his own with Zeus, for his house and everything about him is immortal; but among mortal men - well, there may be another who has as much wealth as I have, or there may not; but at all events I have traveled much and have undergone much hardship, for it was nearly eight years before I could get home with my fleet. I went to Cyprus , Phoenicia and the Egyptians; I went also to the Ethiopians, the Sidonians, and the Erembians, and to Libya where the lambs have horns as soon as they are born, and the sheep bear lambs three times a year. Every one in that country, whether master or man, has plenty of cheese, meat, and good milk, for the ewes yield all the year round. But while I was traveling and getting great riches among these people, my brother was secretly and shockingly murdered through the perfidy of his wicked wife, so that I have no pleasure in being lord of all this wealth. Whoever your parents may be they must have told you about all this, and of my heavy loss in the ruin of a stately mansion fully and magnificently furnished. Would that I had only a third of what I now have so that I had stayed at home, and all those were living who perished on the plain of Troy , far from Argos . I often grieve, as I sit here in my house, for one and all of them. At times I cry aloud for sorrow, but presently I leave off again, for crying is cold comfort and one soon tires of it. Yet grieve for these as I may, I do so for one man more than for them all. I cannot even think of him without loathing both food and sleep, so miserable does he make me, for no one of all the Achaeans worked so hard or risked so much as he did. He took nothing by it, and has left a legacy of sorrow   to myself, for he has been gone a long time, and we know not whether he is alive or dead. His old father, his long-suffering wife Penelope, and his son Telemakhos, whom he left behind him an infant in arms, are plunged in grief on his account."""	τοῦ δʼ ἀγορεύοντος ξύνετο ξανθὸς Μενέλαος, καί σφεας φωνήσας ἔπεα πτερόεντα προσηύδα· τέκνα φίλʼ, ἦ τοι Ζηνὶ βροτῶν οὐκ ἄν τις ἐρίζοι· ἀθάνατοι γὰρ τοῦ γε δόμοι καὶ κτήματʼ ἔασιν· ἀνδρῶν δʼ ἤ κέν τίς μοι ἐρίσσεται, ἠὲ καὶ οὐκί, κτήμασιν. ἦ γὰρ πολλὰ παθὼν καὶ πόλλʼ ἐπαληθεὶς ἠγαγόμην ἐν νηυσὶ καὶ ὀγδοάτῳ ἔτει ἦλθον, Κύπρον Φοινίκην τε καὶ Αἰγυπτίους ἐπαληθείς, Αἰθίοπάς θʼ ἱκόμην καὶ Σιδονίους καὶ Ἐρεμβοὺς καὶ Λιβύην, ἵνα τʼ ἄρνες ἄφαρ κεραοὶ τελέθουσι. τρὶς γὰρ τίκτει μῆλα τελεσφόρον εἰς ἐνιαυτόν. ἔνθα μὲν οὔτε ἄναξ ἐπιδευὴς οὔτε τι ποιμὴν τυροῦ καὶ κρειῶν οὐδὲ γλυκεροῖο γάλακτος, ἀλλʼ αἰεὶ παρέχουσιν ἐπηετανὸν γάλα θῆσθαι. ἧος ἐγὼ περὶ κεῖνα πολὺν βίοτον συναγείρων ἠλώμην, τῆός μοι ἀδελφεὸν ἄλλος ἔπεφνεν λάθρῃ, ἀνωιστί, δόλῳ οὐλομένης ἀλόχοιο· ὣς οὔ τοι χαίρων τοῖσδε κτεάτεσσιν ἀνάσσω. καὶ πατέρων τάδε μέλλετʼ ἀκουέμεν, οἵ τινες ὑμῖν εἰσίν, ἐπεὶ μάλα πολλὰ πάθον, καὶ ἀπώλεσα οἶκον εὖ μάλα ναιετάοντα, κεχανδότα πολλὰ καὶ ἐσθλά. ὧν ὄφελον τριτάτην περ ἔχων ἐν δώμασι μοῖραν ναίειν, οἱ δʼ ἄνδρες σόοι ἔμμεναι, οἳ τότʼ ὄλοντο Τροίῃ ἐν εὐρείῃ ἑκὰς Ἄργεος ἱπποβότοιο. ἀλλʼ ἔμπης πάντας μὲν ὀδυρόμενος καὶ ἀχεύων πολλάκις ἐν μεγάροισι καθήμενος ἡμετέροισιν ἄλλοτε μέν τε γόῳ φρένα τέρπομαι, ἄλλοτε δʼ αὖτε παύομαι· αἰψηρὸς δὲ κόρος κρυεροῖο γόοιο. τῶν πάντων οὐ τόσσον ὀδύρομαι, ἀχνύμενός περ, ὡς ἑνός, ὅς τέ μοι ὕπνον ἀπεχθαίρει καὶ ἐδωδὴν μνωομένῳ, ἐπεὶ οὔ τις Ἀχαιῶν τόσσʼ ἐμόγησεν, ὅσσʼ Ὀδυσεὺς ἐμόγησε καὶ ἤρατο. τῷ δʼ ἄρʼ ἔμελλεν αὐτῷ κήδεʼ ἔσεσθαι, ἐμοὶ δʼ ἄχος αἰὲν ἄλαστον κείνου, ὅπως δὴ δηρὸν ἀποίχεται, οὐδέ τι ἴδμεν, ζώει ὅ γʼ ἦ τέθνηκεν. ὀδύρονταί νύ που αὐτὸν Λαέρτης θʼ ὁ γέρων καὶ ἐχέφρων Πηνελόπεια Τηλέμαχός θʼ, ὃν ἔλειπε νέον γεγαῶτʼ ἐνὶ οἴκῳ.
Thus spoke Menelaos, and the heart of Telemakhos yearned as he bethought him of his father. Tears fell from his eyes as he heard him thus mentioned, so that he held his cloak before his face with both hands. When Menelaos saw this he doubted whether to let him choose his own time for speaking, or to ask him at once and find what it was all about.	ὣς φάτο, τῷ δʼ ἄρα πατρὸς ὑφʼ ἵμερον ὦρσε γόοιο. δάκρυ δʼ ἀπὸ βλεφάρων χαμάδις βάλε πατρὸς ἀκούσας, χλαῖναν πορφυρέην ἄντʼ ὀφθαλμοῖιν ἀνασχὼν ἀμφοτέρῃσιν χερσί. νόησε δέ μιν Μενέλαος, μερμήριξε δʼ ἔπειτα κατὰ φρένα καὶ κατὰ θυμόν, ἠέ μιν αὐτὸν πατρὸς ἐάσειε μνησθῆναι ἦ πρῶτʼ ἐξερέοιτο ἕκαστά τε πειρήσαιτο.
While he was thus in two minds Helen came down from her high-vaulted and perfumed room, looking as lovely as Artemis herself. Adraste brought her a seat, Alkippe a soft woolen rug, while Phylo fetched her the silver work-box which Alkandra wife of Polybos had given her. Polybos lived in Egyptian Thebes, which is the richest city in the whole world; he gave Menelaos two baths, both of pure silver, two tripods, and ten talents of gold; besides all this, his wife gave Helen some beautiful presents, to wit, a golden distaff, and a silver work-box that ran on wheels, with a gold band round the top of it. Phylo now placed this by her side, full of fine spun yarn, and a distaff charged with violet colored wool was laid upon the top of it. Then Helen took her seat, put her feet upon the footstool, and began to question her husband.	ἧος ὁ ταῦθʼ ὥρμαινε κατὰ φρένα καὶ κατὰ θυμόν, ἐκ δʼ Ἑλένη θαλάμοιο θυώδεος ὑψορόφοιο ἤλυθεν Ἀρτέμιδι χρυσηλακάτῳ ἐικυῖα. τῇ δʼ ἄρʼ ἅμʼ Ἀδρήστη κλισίην εὔτυκτον ἔθηκεν, Ἀλκίππη δὲ τάπητα φέρεν μαλακοῦ ἐρίοιο, Φυλὼ δʼ ἀργύρεον τάλαρον φέρε, τόν οἱ ἔθηκεν Ἀλκάνδρη, Πολύβοιο δάμαρ, ὃς ἔναιʼ ἐνὶ Θήβῃς Αἰγυπτίῃς, ὅθι πλεῖστα δόμοις ἐν κτήματα κεῖται· ὃς Μενελάῳ δῶκε δύʼ ἀργυρέας ἀσαμίνθους, δοιοὺς δὲ τρίποδας, δέκα δὲ χρυσοῖο τάλαντα. χωρὶς δʼ αὖθʼ Ἑλένῃ ἄλοχος πόρε κάλλιμα δῶρα· χρυσέην τʼ ἠλακάτην τάλαρόν θʼ ὑπόκυκλον ὄπασσεν ἀργύρεον, χρυσῷ δʼ ἐπὶ χείλεα κεκράαντο. τόν ῥά οἱ ἀμφίπολος Φυλὼ παρέθηκε φέρουσα νήματος ἀσκητοῖο βεβυσμένον· αὐτὰρ ἐπʼ αὐτῷ ἠλακάτη τετάνυστο ἰοδνεφὲς εἶρος ἔχουσα. ἕζετο δʼ ἐν κλισμῷ, ὑπὸ δὲ θρῆνυς ποσὶν ἦεν. αὐτίκα δʼ ἥ γʼ ἐπέεσσι πόσιν ἐρέεινεν ἕκαστα·
"""Do we know, Menelaos,"" said she, ""the names of these strangers who have come to visit us? Shall I guess right or wrong? But I cannot help saying what I think. Never yet have I seen either man or woman so like somebody else (indeed when I look at him I hardly know what to think) as this young man is like Telemakhos, whom Odysseus left as a baby behind him, when you Achaeans went to Troy with battle in your hearts, on account of my most shameless self."""	ἴδμεν δή, Μενέλαε διοτρεφές, οἵ τινες οἵδε ἀνδρῶν εὐχετόωνται ἱκανέμεν ἡμέτερον δῶ; ψεύσομαι ἦ ἔτυμον ἐρέω; κέλεται δέ με θυμός. οὐ γάρ πώ τινά φημι ἐοικότα ὧδε ἰδέσθαι οὔτʼ ἄνδρʼ οὔτε γυναῖκα, σέβας μʼ ἔχει εἰσορόωσαν, ὡς ὅδʼ Ὀδυσσῆος μεγαλήτορος υἷι ἔοικε, Τηλεμάχῳ, τὸν ἔλειπε νέον γεγαῶτʼ ἐνὶ οἴκῳ κεῖνος ἀνήρ, ὅτʼ ἐμεῖο κυνώπιδος εἵνεκʼ Ἀχαιοὶ ἤλθεθʼ ὑπὸ Τροίην πόλεμον θρασὺν ὁρμαίνοντες.
"""My dear wife,"" replied Menelaos, ""I see the likeness just as you do. His hands and feet are just like Odysseus’ so is his hair, with the shape of his head and the expression of his eyes. Moreover, when I was talking about Odysseus, and saying how much he had suffered on my account, tears fell from his eyes, and he hid his face in his mantle."""	τὴν δʼ ἀπαμειβόμενος προσέφη ξανθὸς Μενέλαος· οὕτω νῦν καὶ ἐγὼ νοέω, γύναι, ὡς σὺ ἐίσκεις· κείνου γὰρ τοιοίδε πόδες τοιαίδε τε χεῖρες ὀφθαλμῶν τε βολαὶ κεφαλή τʼ ἐφύπερθέ τε χαῖται. καὶ νῦν ἦ τοι ἐγὼ μεμνημένος ἀμφʼ Ὀδυσῆι μυθεόμην, ὅσα κεῖνος ὀιζύσας ἐμόγησεν ἀμφʼ ἐμοί, αὐτὰρ ὁ πικρὸν ὑπʼ ὀφρύσι δάκρυον εἶβε, χλαῖναν πορφυρέην ἄντʼ ὀφθαλμοῖιν ἀνασχών.
"Then Peisistratos said, ""Menelaos, son of Atreus, you are right in thinking that this young man is Telemakhos, but he is very modest, and is ashamed to come here and begin opening up discourse with one whose conversation is so divinely interesting as your own. My father, Nestor, sent me to escort him hither, for he wanted to know whether you could give him any counsel or suggestion. A son has always trouble at home when his father has gone away leaving him without supporters; and this is how Telemakhos is now placed, for his father is absent, and there is no one among his own to stand by him."""	τὸν δʼ αὖ Νεστορίδης Πεισίστρατος ἀντίον ηὔδα· Ἀτρεΐδη Μενέλαε διοτρεφές, ὄρχαμε λαῶν, κείνου μέν τοι ὅδʼ υἱὸς ἐτήτυμον, ὡς ἀγορεύεις· ἀλλὰ σαόφρων ἐστί, νεμεσσᾶται δʼ ἐνὶ θυμῷ ὧδʼ ἐλθὼν τὸ πρῶτον ἐπεσβολίας ἀναφαίνειν ἄντα σέθεν, τοῦ νῶι θεοῦ ὣς τερπόμεθʼ αὐδῇ. αὐτὰρ ἐμὲ προέηκε Γερήνιος ἱππότα Νέστωρ τῷ ἅμα πομπὸν ἕπεσθαι· ἐέλδετο γάρ σε ἰδέσθαι, ὄφρα οἱ ἤ τι ἔπος ὑποθήσεαι ἠέ τι ἔργον. πολλὰ γὰρ ἄλγεʼ ἔχει πατρὸς πάϊς οἰχομένοιο ἐν μεγάροις, ᾧ μὴ ἄλλοι ἀοσσητῆρες ἔωσιν, ὡς νῦν Τηλεμάχῳ ὁ μὲν οἴχεται, οὐδέ οἱ ἄλλοι εἴσʼ οἵ κεν κατὰ δῆμον ἀλάλκοιεν κακότητα.
"""Bless my heart,"" replied Menelaos; ""then I am receiving a visit from the son of a very dear friend, who suffered much hardship   for my sake. I had always hoped to entertain him with most marked distinction when heaven had granted us a safe return   from beyond the seas. I should have founded a city for him in Argos , and built him a house. I should have made him leave Ithaca with his goods, his son, and all his people, and should have sacked for them some one of the neighboring cities that are subject to me. We should thus have seen one another continually, and nothing but death could have interrupted so close and happy an intercourse. I suppose, however, that heaven grudged us such good fortune, for it has prevented the poor man from ever getting home at all."""	τὸν δʼ ἀπαμειβόμενος προσέφη ξανθὸς Μενέλαος· ὢ πόποι, ἦ μάλα δὴ φίλου ἀνέρος υἱὸς ἐμὸν δῶ ἵκεθʼ, ὃς εἵνεκʼ ἐμεῖο πολέας ἐμόγησεν ἀέθλους· καί μιν ἔφην ἐλθόντα φιλησέμεν ἔξοχον ἄλλων Ἀργείων, εἰ νῶιν ὑπεὶρ ἅλα νόστον ἔδωκε νηυσὶ θοῇσι γενέσθαι Ὀλύμπιος εὐρύοπα Ζεύς. καί κέ οἱ Ἄργεϊ νάσσα πόλιν καὶ δώματʼ ἔτευξα, ἐξ Ἰθάκης ἀγαγὼν σὺν κτήμασι καὶ τέκεϊ ᾧ καὶ πᾶσιν λαοῖσι, μίαν πόλιν ἐξαλαπάξας, αἳ περιναιετάουσιν, ἀνάσσονται δʼ ἐμοὶ αὐτῷ. καί κε θάμʼ ἐνθάδʼ ἐόντες ἐμισγόμεθʼ· οὐδέ κεν ἡμέας ἄλλο διέκρινεν φιλέοντέ τε τερπομένω τε, πρίν γʼ ὅτε δὴ θανάτοιο μέλαν νέφος ἀμφεκάλυψεν. ἀλλὰ τὰ μέν που μέλλεν ἀγάσσεσθαι θεὸς αὐτός, ὃς κεῖνον δύστηνον ἀνόστιμον οἶον ἔθηκεν.
Thus did he speak, and his words set them all to weeping. Helen wept, Telemakhos wept, and so did Menelaos, nor could Peisistratos keep his eyes from filling, when he remembered his dear brother Antilokhos whom the son of bright Dawn had killed. Thereon he said to Menelaos,	ὣς φάτο, τοῖσι δὲ πᾶσιν ὑφʼ ἵμερον ὦρσε γόοιο. κλαῖε μὲν Ἀργείη Ἑλένη, Διὸς ἐκγεγαυῖα, κλαῖε δὲ Τηλέμαχός τε καὶ Ἀτρεΐδης Μενέλαος, οὐδʼ ἄρα Νέστορος υἱὸς ἀδακρύτω ἔχεν ὄσσε· μνήσατο γὰρ κατὰ θυμὸν ἀμύμονος Ἀντιλόχοιο, τόν ῥʼ Ἠοῦς ἔκτεινε φαεινῆς ἀγλαὸς υἱός· τοῦ ὅ γʼ ἐπιμνησθεὶς ἔπεα πτερόεντʼ ἀγόρευεν·
"""Sir, my father Nestor, when we used to talk about you at home, told me you were a person of rare and excellent understanding. If, then, it be possible, do as I would urge you. I am not fond of crying while I am getting my supper. Morning will come in due course, and in the forenoon I care not how much I cry for those that are dead and gone. This is all we can do for the poor things. We can only shave our heads for them and wring the tears from our cheeks. I had a brother who died at Troy ; he was by no means the worst man there; you are sure to have known him - his name was Antilokhos; I never set eyes upon him myself, but they say that he was singularly fleet of foot and in fight valiant."""	Ἀτρεΐδη, περὶ μέν σε βροτῶν πεπνυμένον εἶναι Νέστωρ φάσχʼ ὁ γέρων, ὅτʼ ἐπιμνησαίμεθα σεῖο οἷσιν ἐνὶ μεγάροισι, καὶ ἀλλήλους ἐρέοιμεν. καὶ νῦν, εἴ τί που ἔστι, πίθοιό μοι· οὐ γὰρ ἐγώ γε τέρπομʼ ὀδυρόμενος μεταδόρπιος, ἀλλὰ καὶ ἠὼς ἔσσεται ἠριγένεια· νεμεσσῶμαί γε μὲν οὐδὲν κλαίειν ὅς κε θάνῃσι βροτῶν καὶ πότμον ἐπίσπῃ. τοῦτό νυ καὶ γέρας οἶον ὀιζυροῖσι βροτοῖσιν, κείρασθαί τε κόμην βαλέειν τʼ ἀπὸ δάκρυ παρειῶν. καὶ γὰρ ἐμὸς τέθνηκεν ἀδελφεός, οὔ τι κάκιστος Ἀργείων· μέλλεις δὲ σὺ ἴδμεναι· οὐ γὰρ ἐγώ γε ἤντησʼ οὐδὲ ἴδον· περὶ δʼ ἄλλων φασὶ γενέσθαι Ἀντίλοχον, πέρι μὲν θείειν ταχὺν ἠδὲ μαχητήν.
"""Your discretion, my friend,"" answered Menelaos, ""is beyond your years. It is plain you take after your father. One can soon see when a man is son to one whom Zeus grants blessedness   both as regards wife and offspring - and he has blessed Nestor from first to last all his days, giving him a green old age in his own house, with sons about him who are both well disposed and valiant. We will put an end therefore to all this weeping, and attend to our supper again. Let water be poured over our hands. Telemakhos and I can talk with one another fully in the morning."""	τὸν δʼ ἀπαμειβόμενος προσέφη ξανθὸς Μενέλαος· ὦ φίλʼ, ἐπεὶ τόσα εἶπες, ὅσʼ ἂν πεπνυμένος ἀνὴρ εἴποι καὶ ῥέξειε, καὶ ὃς προγενέστερος εἴη· τοίου γὰρ καὶ πατρός, ὃ καὶ πεπνυμένα βάζεις, ῥεῖα δʼ ἀρίγνωτος γόνος ἀνέρος ᾧ τε Κρονίων ὄλβον ἐπικλώσῃ γαμέοντί τε γεινομένῳ τε, ὡς νῦν Νέστορι δῶκε διαμπερὲς ἤματα πάντα αὐτὸν μὲν λιπαρῶς γηρασκέμεν ἐν μεγάροισιν, υἱέας αὖ πινυτούς τε καὶ ἔγχεσιν εἶναι ἀρίστους. ἡμεῖς δὲ κλαυθμὸν μὲν ἐάσομεν, ὃς πρὶν ἐτύχθη, δόρπου δʼ ἐξαῦτις μνησώμεθα, χερσὶ δʼ ἐφʼ ὕδωρ χευάντων. μῦθοι δὲ καὶ ἠῶθέν περ ἔσονται Τηλεμάχῳ καὶ ἐμοὶ διαειπέμεν ἀλλήλοισιν.
On this Asphalion, one of the servants, poured water over their hands and they laid their hands on the good things that were before them.	ὣς ἔφατʼ, Ἀσφαλίων δʼ ἄρʼ ὕδωρ ἐπὶ χεῖρας ἔχευεν, ὀτρηρὸς θεράπων Μενελάου κυδαλίμοιο. οἱ δʼ ἐπʼ ὀνείαθʼ ἑτοῖμα προκείμενα χεῖρας ἴαλλον.
Then Zeus’ daughter Helen bethought her of another matter. She drugged the wine with the herb = anti- , which banishes all care, sorrow, and anger. Whoever drinks wine thus drugged cannot shed a single tear all the rest of the day, not even though his father and mother both of them drop down dead, or he sees a brother or a son hewn in pieces before his very eyes. This drug, of such sovereign power and virtue, had been given to Helen by Polydamna wife of Thon , a woman of Egypt , where there grow all sorts of herbs, some good to put into the mixing-bowl and others poisonous. Moreover, every one in the whole country is a skilled physician, for they are of the race of Paieon. When Helen had put this drug in the bowl, and had told the servants to serve the wine round, she said:	ἔνθʼ αὖτʼ ἄλλʼ ἐνόησʼ Ἑλένη Διὸς ἐκγεγαυῖα· αὐτίκʼ ἄρʼ εἰς οἶνον βάλε φάρμακον, ἔνθεν ἔπινον, νηπενθές τʼ ἄχολόν τε, κακῶν ἐπίληθον ἁπάντων. ὃς τὸ καταβρόξειεν, ἐπὴν κρητῆρι μιγείη, οὔ κεν ἐφημέριός γε βάλοι κατὰ δάκρυ παρειῶν, οὐδʼ εἴ οἱ κατατεθναίη μήτηρ τε πατήρ τε, οὐδʼ εἴ οἱ προπάροιθεν ἀδελφεὸν ἢ φίλον υἱὸν χαλκῷ δηιόῳεν, ὁ δʼ ὀφθαλμοῖσιν ὁρῷτο. τοῖα Διὸς θυγάτηρ ἔχε φάρμακα μητιόεντα, ἐσθλά, τά οἱ Πολύδαμνα πόρεν, Θῶνος παράκοιτις Αἰγυπτίη, τῇ πλεῖστα φέρει ζείδωρος ἄρουρα φάρμακα, πολλὰ μὲν ἐσθλὰ μεμιγμένα πολλὰ δὲ λυγρά· ἰητρὸς δὲ ἕκαστος ἐπιστάμενος περὶ πάντων ἀνθρώπων· ἦ γὰρ Παιήονός εἰσι γενέθλης. αὐτὰρ ἐπεί ῥʼ ἐνέηκε κέλευσέ τε οἰνοχοῆσαι, ἐξαῦτις μύθοισιν ἀμειβομένη προσέειπεν·
"""Menelaos, son of Atreus, and you my good friends, sons of honorable men (which is as Zeus wills, for he is the giver both of good and evil, and can do what he chooses), feast here as you will, and listen while I tell you a tale in season. I cannot indeed name every single one of the exploits   of Odysseus, but I can say what he did when he was in the Trojan , and you Achaeans were in all sorts of difficulties. He covered himself with wounds and bruises, dressed himself all in rags, and entered the enemy's city looking like a menial or a beggar, quite different from how he looked when he was among his own people. In this disguise he entered the city of Troy , and no one said anything to him. I alone recognized him and began to question him, but he was too cunning for me. When, however, I had washed and anointed him and had given him clothes, and after I had sworn a solemn oath not to betray him to the Trojans till he had got safely back to his own camp and to the ships, he explained to me the whole of the Achaeans. He killed many Trojans and got much information before he reached the Argive camp, for all which things the Trojan women made lamentation, but for my own part I was glad, for my heart was beginning to long after my home, and I was unhappy about the wrong   that Aphrodite had done me in taking me over there, away from my country, my girl, and my lawful wedded husband, who is indeed by no means deficient either in looks or understanding."""

"Then Menelaos said, ""All that you have been saying, my dear wife, is true. I have traveled much, and have learned the plans and of many a hero, but I have never seen such another man as Odysseus. What endurance too, and what courage he displayed within the wooden horse, wherein all the bravest of the Argives were lying in wait to bring death and destruction upon the Trojans. At that moment you came up to us; some who wished well to the Trojans must have set you on to it and you had Deiphobos with you. Three times did you go all round our hiding place and pat it; you called our chiefs each by his own name, and mimicked all our wives. Diomedes, Odysseus, and I from our seats inside heard what a noise you made. Diomedes and I could not make up our minds whether to spring out then and there, or to answer you from inside, but Odysseus held us all in check, so we sat quite still, all except Antiklos, who was beginning to answer you, when Odysseus clapped his two brawny hands over his mouth, and kept them there. It was this that saved us all, for he muzzled Antiklos till Athena took you away again."""	τὴν δʼ ἀπαμειβόμενος προσέφη ξανθὸς Μενέλαος· ναὶ δὴ ταῦτά γε πάντα, γύναι, κατὰ μοῖραν ἔειπες. ἤδη μὲν πολέων ἐδάην βουλήν τε νόον τε ἀνδρῶν ἡρώων, πολλὴν δʼ ἐπελήλυθα γαῖαν· ἀλλʼ οὔ πω τοιοῦτον ἐγὼν ἴδον ὀφθαλμοῖσιν, οἷoν Ὀδυσσῆος ταλασίφρονος ἔσκε φίλον κῆρ. οἷον καὶ τόδʼ ἔρεξε καὶ ἔτλη καρτερὸς ἀνὴρ ἵππῳ ἔνι ξεστῷ, ἵνʼ ἐνήμεθα πάντες ἄριστοι Ἀργείων Τρώεσσι φόνον καὶ κῆρα φέροντες. ἦλθες ἔπειτα σὺ κεῖσε· κελευσέμεναι δέ σʼ ἔμελλε δαίμων, ὃς Τρώεσσιν ἐβούλετο κῦδος ὀρέξαι· καί τοι Δηΐφοβος θεοείκελος ἕσπετʼ ἰούσῃ. τρὶς δὲ περίστειξας κοῖλον λόχον ἀμφαφόωσα, ἐκ δʼ ὀνομακλήδην Δαναῶν ὀνόμαζες ἀρίστους, πάντων Ἀργείων φωνὴν ἴσκουσʼ ἀλόχοισιν. αὐτὰρ ἐγὼ καὶ Τυδεΐδης καὶ δῖος Ὀδυσσεὺς ἥμενοι ἐν μέσσοισιν ἀκούσαμεν ὡς ἐβόησας. νῶι μὲν ἀμφοτέρω μενεήναμεν ὁρμηθέντε ἢ ἐξελθέμεναι, ἢ ἔνδοθεν αἶψʼ ὑπακοῦσαι· ἀλλʼ Ὀδυσεὺς κατέρυκε καὶ ἔσχεθεν ἱεμένω περ. ἔνθʼ ἄλλοι μὲν πάντες ἀκὴν ἔσαν υἷες Ἀχαιῶν, Ἄντικλος δὲ σέ γʼ οἶος ἀμείψασθαι ἐπέεσσιν ἤθελεν. ἀλλʼ Ὀδυσεὺς ἐπὶ μάστακα χερσὶ πίεζεν νωλεμέως κρατερῇσι, σάωσε δὲ πάντας Ἀχαιούς· τόφρα δʼ ἔχʼ, ὄφρα σε νόσφιν ἀπήγαγε Παλλὰς Ἀθήνη.
"""How sad,"" exclaimed Telemakhos, ""that all this was of no avail to save him, nor yet his own iron courage. But now, sir, be pleased to send us all to bed, that we may lie down and enjoy the blessed boon of sleep."""	τὸν δʼ αὖ Τηλέμαχος πεπνυμένος ἀντίον ηὔδα· Ἀτρεΐδη Μενέλαε διοτρεφές, ὄρχαμε λαῶν, ἄλγιον· οὐ γάρ οἵ τι τάδʼ ἤρκεσε λυγρὸν ὄλεθρον, οὐδʼ εἴ οἱ κραδίη γε σιδηρέη ἔνδοθεν ἦεν. ἀλλʼ ἄγετʼ εἰς εὐνὴν τράπεθʼ ἡμέας, ὄφρα καὶ ἤδη ὕπνῳ ὕπο γλυκερῷ ταρπώμεθα κοιμηθέντες.
On this Helen told the maid servants to set beds in the room that was in the gatehouse, and to make them with good red rugs, and spread coverlets on the top of them with woolen cloaks for the guests to wear. So the maids went out, carrying a torch, and made the beds, to which a man-servant presently conducted the strangers. Thus, then, did Telemakhos and Peisistratos sleep there in the forecourt, while the son of Atreus lay in an inner room with lovely Helen by his side.	ὣς ἔφατʼ, Ἀργείη δʼ Ἑλένη δμῳῇσι κέλευσεν δέμνιʼ ὑπʼ αἰθούσῃ θέμεναι καὶ ῥήγεα καλὰ πορφύρεʼ ἐμβαλέειν στορέσαι τʼ ἐφύπερθε τάπητας, χλαίνας τʼ ἐνθέμεναι οὔλας καθύπερθεν ἕσασθαι. αἱ δʼ ἴσαν ἐκ μεγάροιο δάος μετὰ χερσὶν ἔχουσαι, δέμνια δὲ στόρεσαν· ἐκ δὲ ξείνους ἄγε κῆρυξ. οἱ μὲν ἄρʼ ἐν προδόμῳ δόμου αὐτόθι κοιμήσαντο, Τηλέμαχός θʼ ἥρως καὶ Νέστορος ἀγλαὸς υἱός· Ἀτρεΐδης δὲ καθεῦδε μυχῷ δόμου ὑψηλοῖο, πὰρ δʼ Ἑλένη τανύπεπλος ἐλέξατο, δῖα γυναικῶν.
When the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared, Menelaos rose and dressed himself. He bound his sandals on to his comely feet, girded his sword about his shoulders, and left his room looking like an immortal god. Then, taking a seat near Telemakhos he said:	ἦμος δʼ ἠριγένεια φάνη ῥοδοδάκτυλος Ἠώς, ὤρνυτʼ ἄρʼ ἐξ εὐνῆφι βοὴν ἀγαθὸς Μενέλαος εἵματα ἑσσάμενος, περὶ δὲ ξίφος ὀξὺ θέτʼ ὤμῳ, ποσσὶ δʼ ὑπὸ λιπαροῖσιν ἐδήσατο καλὰ πέδιλα, βῆ δʼ ἴμεν ἐκ θαλάμοιο θεῷ ἐναλίγκιος ἄντην, Τηλεμάχῳ δὲ παρῖζεν, ἔπος τʼ ἔφατʼ ἔκ τʼ ὀνόμαζεν·
"""And what, Telemakhos, has led you to take this long sea voyage to Lacedaemon ? Are you on public or private business? Tell me all about it."""	τίπτε δέ σε χρειὼ δεῦρʼ ἤγαγε, Τηλέμαχʼ ἥρως, ἐς Λακεδαίμονα δῖαν, ἐπʼ εὐρέα νῶτα θαλάσσης; δήμιον ἦ ἴδιον; τόδε μοι νημερτὲς ἐνίσπες.
"""I have come, sir replied Telemakhos, ""to see if you can tell me anything about my father. I am being eaten out of house and home; my fair estate is being wasted, and my house is full of miscreants who in overweening keep killing great numbers of my sheep and oxen, on the pretense of wooing my mother. Therefore, I am suppliant at your knees if haply you may tell me about my father's melancholy end, whether you saw it with your own eyes, or heard it from some other traveler; for he was a man born to trouble. Do not soften things out of any pity for myself, but tell me in all plainness exactly what you saw. If my brave father Odysseus ever did you loyal service either by word or deed, when you Achaeans were harassed in the of the Trojans, bear it in mind now as in my favor and tell me truly all."""	τὸν δʼ αὖ Τηλέμαχος πεπνυμένος ἀντίον ηὔδα· Ἀτρεΐδη Μενέλαε διοτρεφές, ὄρχαμε λαῶν, ἤλυθον, εἴ τινά μοι κληηδόνα πατρὸς ἐνίσποις. ἐσθίεταί μοι οἶκος, ὄλωλε δὲ πίονα ἔργα, δυσμενέων δʼ ἀνδρῶν πλεῖος δόμος, οἵ τέ μοι αἰεὶ μῆλʼ ἁδινὰ σφάζουσι καὶ εἰλίποδας ἕλικας βοῦς, μητρὸς ἐμῆς μνηστῆρες ὑπέρβιον ὕβριν ἔχοντες. τοὔνεκα νῦν τὰ σὰ γούναθʼ ἱκάνομαι, αἴ κʼ ἐθέλῃσθα κείνου λυγρὸν ὄλεθρον ἐνισπεῖν, εἴ που ὄπωπας ὀφθαλμοῖσι τεοῖσιν ἢ ἄλλου μῦθον ἄκουσας πλαζομένου· περὶ γάρ μιν ὀιζυρὸν τέκε μήτηρ. μηδέ τί μʼ αἰδόμενος μειλίσσεο μηδʼ ἐλεαίρων, ἀλλʼ εὖ μοι κατάλεξον ὅπως ἤντησας ὀπωπῆς. λίσσομαι, εἴ ποτέ τοί τι πατὴρ ἐμός, ἐσθλὸς Ὀδυσσεὺς ἢ ἔπος ἠέ τι ἔργον ὑποστὰς ἐξετέλεσσε δήμῳ ἔνι Τρώων, ὅθι πάσχετε πήματʼ Ἀχαιοί, τῶν νῦν μοι μνῆσαι, καί μοι νημερτὲς ἐνίσπες.
"Menelaos on hearing this was very much shocked. ""So,"" he exclaimed, ""these cowards would usurp a brave man's bed? A hind might as well lay her new born young in the lair of a lion, and then go off to feed in the forest or in some grassy dell: the lion when he comes back to his lair will make short work with the pair of them - and so will Odysseus with these suitors. By father Zeus, Athena, and Apollo, if Odysseus is still the man that he was when he wrestled with Philomeleides in Lesbos , and threw him so heavily that all the Achaeans cheered him - if he is still such and were to come near these suitors, they would have a swift doom and a sorry wedding. As regards your questions, however, I will not prevaricate nor deceive you, but will tell you without concealment all that the old man of the sea told me."	τὸν δὲ μέγʼ ὀχθήσας προσέθη ξανθὸς Μενέλαος· ὢ πόποι, ἦ μάλα δὴ κρατερόφρονος ἀνδρὸς ἐν εὐνῇ ἤθελον εὐνηθῆναι ἀνάλκιδες αὐτοὶ ἐόντες. ὡς δʼ ὁπότʼ ἐν ξυλόχῳ ἔλαφος κρατεροῖο λέοντος νεβροὺς κοιμήσασα νεηγενέας γαλαθηνοὺς κνημοὺς ἐξερέῃσι καὶ ἄγκεα ποιήεντα βοσκομένη, ὁ δʼ ἔπειτα ἑὴν εἰσήλυθεν εὐνήν, ἀμφοτέροισι δὲ τοῖσιν ἀεικέα πότμον ἐφῆκεν, ὣς Ὀδυσεὺς κείνοισιν ἀεικέα πότμον ἐφήσει. αἲ γάρ, Ζεῦ τε πάτερ καὶ Ἀθηναίη καὶ Ἄπολλον, τοῖος ἐών, οἷός ποτʼ ἐυκτιμένῃ ἐνὶ Λέσβῳ ἐξ ἔριδος Φιλομηλεΐδῃ ἐπάλαισεν ἀναστάς, κὰδ δʼ ἔβαλε κρατερῶς, κεχάροντο δὲ πάντες Ἀχαιοί, τοῖος ἐὼν μνηστῆρσιν ὁμιλήσειεν Ὀδυσσεύς· πάντες κʼ ὠκύμοροί τε γενοίατο πικρόγαμοί τε. ταῦτα δʼ ἅ μʼ εἰρωτᾷς καὶ λίσσεαι, οὐκ ἂν ἐγώ γε ἄλλα παρὲξ εἴποιμι παρακλιδόν, οὐδʼ ἀπατήσω, ἀλλὰ τὰ μέν μοι ἔειπε γέρων ἅλιος νημερτής, τῶν οὐδέν τοι ἐγὼ κρύψω ἔπος οὐδʼ ἐπικεύσω.
"""I was trying to come on here, but the gods detained me in Egypt , for my hecatombs had not given them full satisfaction, and the gods are very strict about having their dues. Now off Egypt , about as far as a ship can sail in a day with a good stiff breeze behind her, there is an island called Pharos - it has a good harbor from which vessels can get out into open sea when they have taken in water - and the gods becalmed me twenty days without so much as a breath of fair wind to help me forward. We should have run clean out of provisions and my men would have starved, if a goddess had not taken pity upon me and saved me in the person of Eidothea, daughter to Proteus, the old man of the sea, for she had taken a great fancy to me."

Then she dug four pits for us to lie in, and sat down to wait till we should come up. When we were close to her, she made us lie down in the pits one after the other, and threw a seal skin over each of us. Our ambuscade would have been intolerable, for the stench of the fishy seals was most distressing - who would go to bed with a sea monster if he could help it?-but here, too, the goddess helped us, and thought of something that gave us great relief, for she put some ambrosia under each man's nostrils, which was so fragrant that it killed the smell of the seals."	ἦμος δʼ ἠριγένεια φάνη ῥοδοδάκτυλος Ἠώς, καὶ τότε δὴ παρὰ θῖνα θαλάσσης εὐρυπόροιο ἤια πολλὰ θεοὺς γουνούμενος· αὐτὰρ ἑταίρους τρεῖς ἄγον, οἷσι μάλιστα πεποίθεα πᾶσαν ἐπʼ ἰθύν. τόφρα δʼ ἄρʼ ἥ γʼ ὑποδῦσα θαλάσσης εὐρέα κόλπον τέσσαρα φωκάων ἐκ πόντου δέρματʼ ἔνεικε· πάντα δʼ ἔσαν νεόδαρτα· δόλον δʼ ἐπεμήδετο πατρί. εὐνὰς δʼ ἐν ψαμάθοισι διαγλάψασʼ ἁλίῃσιν ἧστο μένουσʼ· ἡμεῖς δὲ μάλα σχεδὸν ἤλθομεν αὐτῆς· ἑξείης δʼ εὔνησε, βάλεν δʼ ἐπὶ δέρμα ἑκάστῳ. ἔνθα κεν αἰνότατος λόχος ἔπλετο· τεῖρε γὰρ αἰνῶς φωκάων ἁλιοτρεφέων ὀλοώτατος ὀδμή· τίς γάρ κʼ εἰναλίῳ παρὰ κήτεϊ κοιμηθείη; ἀλλʼ αὐτὴ ἐσάωσε καὶ ἐφράσατο μέγʼ ὄνειαρ· ἀμβροσίην ὑπὸ ῥῖνα ἑκάστῳ θῆκε φέρουσα ἡδὺ μάλα πνείουσαν, ὄλεσσε δὲ κήτεος ὀδμήν.

He said the gods could not drown him even though they had tried to do so, and when Poseidon heard this large talk, he seized his trident in his two brawny hands, and split the rock of Gyrae in two pieces.

This will happen to you because you have married Helen, and are Zeus’ son-in-law.’"	ὣς ἐφάμην, ὁ δέ μʼ αὐτίκʼ ἀμειβόμενος προσέειπεν· υἱὸς Λαέρτεω, Ἰθάκῃ ἔνι οἰκία ναίων· τὸν δʼ ἴδον ἐν νήσῳ θαλερὸν κατὰ δάκρυ χέοντα, νύμφης ἐν μεγάροισι Καλυψοῦς, ἥ μιν ἀνάγκῃ ἴσχει· ὁ δʼ οὐ δύναται ἣν πατρίδα γαῖαν ἱκέσθαι· οὐ γάρ οἱ πάρα νῆες ἐπήρετμοι καὶ ἑταῖροι, οἵ κέν μιν πέμποιεν ἐπʼ εὐρέα νῶτα θαλάσσης. σοὶ δʼ οὐ θέσφατόν ἐστι, διοτρεφὲς ὦ Μενέλαε, Ἄργει ἐν ἱπποβότῳ θανέειν καὶ πότμον ἐπισπεῖν, ἀλλά σʼ ἐς Ἠλύσιον πεδίον καὶ πείρατα γαίης ἀθάνατοι πέμψουσιν, ὅθι ξανθὸς Ῥαδάμανθυς, τῇ περ ῥηίστη βιοτὴ πέλει ἀνθρώποισιν· οὐ νιφετός, οὔτʼ ἂρ χειμὼν πολὺς οὔτε ποτʼ ὄμβρος, ἀλλʼ αἰεὶ Ζεφύροιο λιγὺ πνείοντος ἀήτας Ὠκεανὸς ἀνίησιν ἀναψύχειν ἀνθρώπους· οὕνεκʼ ἔχεις Ἑλένην καί σφιν γαμβρὸς Διός ἐσσι.
"""As he spoke he dived under the waves, whereon I turned back to the ships with my companions, and my heart was clouded with care as I went along. When we reached the ships we got supper ready, for night was falling, and camped down upon the beach. When the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn appeared, we drew our ships into the water, and put our masts and sails within them; then we went on board ourselves, took our seats on the benches, and smote the gray sea with our oars. I again stationed my ships in the heaven-fed stream of Egypt , and offered hecatombs that were full and sufficient. When I had thus appeased heaven's anger, I raised a tomb to the memory of Agamemnon that his might be inextinguishable, after which I had a quick passage home, for the gods sent me a fair wind."	ὣς εἰπὼν ὑπὸ πόντον ἐδύσετο κυμαίνοντα. αὐτὰρ ἐγὼν ἐπὶ νῆας ἅμʼ ἀντιθέοις ἑτάροισιν ἤια, πολλὰ δέ μοι κραδίη πόρφυρε κιόντι. αὐτὰρ ἐπεί ῥʼ ἐπὶ νῆα κατήλθομεν ἠδὲ θάλασσαν, δόρπον θʼ ὁπλισάμεσθʼ, ἐπί τʼ ἤλυθεν ἀμβροσίη νύξ, δὴ τότε κοιμήθημεν ἐπὶ ῥηγμῖνι θαλάσσης. ἦμος δʼ ἠριγένεια φάνη ῥοδοδάκτυλος Ἠώς, νῆας μὲν πάμπρωτον ἐρύσσαμεν εἰς ἅλα δῖαν, ἐν δʼ ἱστοὺς τιθέμεσθα καὶ ἱστία νηυσὶν ἐίσῃς, ἂν δὲ καὶ αὐτοὶ βάντες ἐπὶ κληῖσι καθῖζον· ἑξῆς δʼ ἑζόμενοι πολιὴν ἅλα τύπτον ἐρετμοῖς. ἂψ δʼ εἰς Αἰγύπτοιο διιπετέος ποταμοῖο στῆσα νέας, καὶ ἔρεξα τεληέσσας ἑκατόμβας. αὐτὰρ ἐπεὶ κατέπαυσα θεῶν χόλον αἰὲν ἐόντων, χεῦʼ Ἀγαμέμνονι τύμβον, ἵνʼ ἄσβεστον κλέος εἴη. ταῦτα τελευτήσας νεόμην, ἔδοσαν δέ μοι οὖρον ἀθάνατοι, τοί μʼ ὦκα φίλην ἐς πατρίδʼ ἔπεμψαν.
"""And now for yourself - stay here some ten or twelve days longer, and I will then speed you on your way. I will make you a noble present of a chariot and three horses. I will also give you a beautiful chalice that so long as you live you may think of me whenever you make a drink-offering to the immortal gods."""	ἀλλʼ ἄγε νῦν ἐπίμεινον ἐνὶ μεγάροισιν ἐμοῖσιν, ὄφρα κεν ἑνδεκάτη τε δυωδεκάτη τε γένηται· καὶ τότε σʼ εὖ πέμψω, δώσω δέ τοι ἀγλαὰ δῶρα, τρεῖς ἵππους καὶ δίφρον ἐύξοον· αὐτὰρ ἔπειτα δώσω καλὸν ἄλεισον, ἵνα σπένδῃσθα θεοῖσιν ἀθανάτοις ἐμέθεν μεμνημένος ἤματα πάντα.
"""Son of Atreus,"" replied Telemakhos, ""do not press me to stay longer; I should be contented to remain with you for another twelve months; I find your conversation so delightful that I should never once wish myself at home with my parents; but my crew whom I have left at Pylos are already impatient, and you are detaining me from them. As for any present you may be disposed to make me, I had rather that it should he a piece of plate. I will take no horses back with me to Ithaca , but will leave them to adorn your own stables, for you have much flat ground in your kingdom where lotus thrives, as also meadowsweet and wheat and barley, and oats with their white and spreading ears; whereas in Ithaca we have neither open fields nor racecourses, and the country is more fit for goats than horses, and I like it the better for that. None of our islands have much level ground, suitable for horses, and Ithaca least of all."""	τὸν δʼ αὖ Τηλέμαχος πεπνυμένος ἀντίον ηὔδα· Ἀτρεΐδη, μὴ δή με πολὺν χρόνον ἐνθάδʼ ἔρυκε. καὶ γάρ κʼ εἰς ἐνιαυτὸν ἐγὼ παρὰ σοί γʼ ἀνεχοίμην ἥμενος, οὐδέ κέ μʼ οἴκου ἕλοι πόθος οὐδὲ τοκήων· αἰνῶς γὰρ μύθοισιν ἔπεσσί τε σοῖσιν ἀκούων τέρπομαι. ἀλλʼ ἤδη μοι ἀνιάζουσιν ἑταῖροι ἐν Πύλῳ ἠγαθέῃ· σὺ δέ με χρόνον ἐνθάδʼ ἐρύκεις. δῶρον δʼ ὅττι κέ μοι δοίης, κειμήλιον ἔστω· ἵππους δʼ εἰς Ἰθάκην οὐκ ἄξομαι, ἀλλὰ σοὶ αὐτῷ ἐνθάδε λείψω ἄγαλμα· σὺ γὰρ πεδίοιο ἀνάσσεις εὐρέος, ᾧ ἔνι μὲν λωτὸς πολύς, ἐν δὲ κύπειρον πυροί τε ζειαί τε ἰδʼ εὐρυφυὲς κρῖ λευκόν. ἐν δʼ Ἰθάκῃ οὔτʼ ἂρ δρόμοι εὐρέες οὔτε τι λειμών· αἰγίβοτος, καὶ μᾶλλον ἐπήρατος ἱπποβότοιο. οὐ γάρ τις νήσων ἱππήλατος οὐδʼ ἐυλείμων, αἵ θʼ ἁλὶ κεκλίαται· Ἰθάκη δέ τε καὶ περὶ πασέων.
"Menelaos smiled and took Telemakhos’ hand within his own. ""What you say,"" said he, ""shows that you come of good family. I both can, and will, make this exchange for you, by giving you the finest and most precious piece of plate in all my house. It is a mixing-bowl by Hephaistos’ own hand, of pure silver, except the rim, which is inlaid with gold. Phaidimos, king of the Sidonians, gave it me in the course of a visit which I paid him when I returned there on my homeward journey. I will make you a present of it."""	ὣς φάτο, μείδησεν δὲ βοὴν ἀγαθὸς Μενέλαος, χειρί τέ μιν κατέρεξεν ἔπος τʼ ἔφατʼ ἔκ τʼ ὀνόμαζεν· αἵματός εἰς ἀγαθοῖο, φίλον τέκος, οἷʼ ἀγορεύεις· τοιγὰρ ἐγώ τοι ταῦτα μεταστήσω· δύναμαι γάρ. δώρων δʼ ὅσσʼ ἐν ἐμῷ οἴκῳ κειμήλια κεῖται, δώσω ὃ κάλλιστον καὶ τιμηέστατόν ἐστιν· δώσω τοι κρητῆρα τετυγμένον· ἀργύρεος δὲ ἔστιν ἅπας, χρυσῷ δʼ ἐπὶ χείλεα κεκράανται, ἔργον δʼ Ἡφαίστοιο. πόρεν δέ ἑ Φαίδιμος ἥρως, Σιδονίων βασιλεύς, ὅθʼ ἑὸς δόμος ἀμφεκάλυψε κεῖσέ με νοστήσαντα· τεῒν δʼ ἐθέλω τόδʼ ὀπάσσαι.
Thus did they converse as guests kept coming to the king's house. They brought sheep and wine, while their wives had put up bread for them to take with them; so they were busy cooking their dinners in the courts.	ὣς οἱ μὲν τοιαῦτα πρὸς ἀλλήλους ἀγόρευον, δαιτυμόνες δʼ ἐς δώματʼ ἴσαν θείου βασιλῆος. οἱ δʼ ἦγον μὲν μῆλα, φέρον δʼ ἐυήνορα οἶνον· σῖτον δέ σφʼ ἄλοχοι καλλικρήδεμνοι ἔπεμπον. ὣς οἱ μὲν περὶ δεῖπνον ἐνὶ μεγάροισι πένοντο.
Meanwhile the suitors were throwing discs or aiming with spears at a mark on the leveled ground in front of Odysseus’ house, and were behaving with all their old . Antinoos and Eurymakhos, who were their ringleaders and much the foremost in among them all, were sitting together when Noemon son of Phronios came up and said to Antinoos,	μνηστῆρες δὲ πάροιθεν Ὀδυσσῆος μεγάροιο δίσκοισιν τέρποντο καὶ αἰγανέῃσιν ἱέντες ἐν τυκτῷ δαπέδῳ, ὅθι περ πάρος, ὕβριν ἔχοντες.

"""Have we any idea, Antinoos, on what day Telemakhos returns from Pylos ? He has a ship of mine, and I want it, to cross over to Elis : I have twelve brood mares there with yearling mule foals by their side not yet broken in, and I want to bring one of them over here and break him."""	Ἀντίνοʼ, ἦ ῥά τι ἴδμεν ἐνὶ φρεσίν, ἦε καὶ οὐκί, ὁππότε Τηλέμαχος νεῖτʼ ἐκ Πύλου ἠμαθόεντος; νῆά μοι οἴχετʼ ἄγων· ἐμὲ δὲ χρεὼ γίγνεται αὐτῆς Ἤλιδʼ ἐς εὐρύχορον διαβήμεναι, ἔνθα μοι ἵπποι δώδεκα θήλειαι, ὑπὸ δʼ ἡμίονοι ταλαεργοὶ ἀδμῆτες· τῶν κέν τινʼ ἐλασσάμενος δαμασαίμην.
"They were astounded when they heard this, for they had made sure that Telemakhos had not gone to the city of Neleus. They thought he was only away somewhere on the farms, and was with the sheep, or with the swineherd; so Antinoos said, ""When did he go? Tell me truly, and what young men did he take with him? Were they freemen or his own bondsmen - for he might manage that too? Tell me also, did you let him have the ship of your own free will because he asked you, or did he take it by force   without your leave?"""	ὣς ἔφαθʼ, οἱ δʼ ἀνὰ θυμὸν ἐθάμβεον· οὐ γὰρ ἔφαντο ἐς Πύλον οἴχεσθαι Νηλήιον, ἀλλά που αὐτοῦ ἀγρῶν ἢ μήλοισι παρέμμεναι ἠὲ συβώτῃ. τὸν δʼ αὖτʼ Ἀντίνοος προσέφη Εὐπείθεος υἱός· νημερτές μοι ἔνισπε, πότʼ ᾤχετο καὶ τίνες αὐτῷ κοῦροι ἕποντʼ; Ἰθάκης ἐξαίρετοι, ἦ ἑοὶ αὐτοῦ θῆτές τε δμῶές τε; δύναιτό κε καὶ τὸ τελέσσαι. καί μοι τοῦτʼ ἀγόρευσον ἐτήτυμον, ὄφρʼ ἐὺ εἰδῶ, ἤ σε βίῃ ἀέκοντος ἀπηύρα νῆα μέλαιναν, ἦε ἑκών οἱ δῶκας, ἐπεὶ προσπτύξατο μύθῳ.
"""I lent it him,"" answered Noemon. ""What else could I do when a man of his position said he was in a difficulty and asked me to oblige him? I could not possibly refuse. As for those who went with him they were the best young men we have in the , and I saw Mentor go on board as leader - or some god who was exactly like him. I cannot understand it, for I saw Mentor here myself yesterday morning, and yet he was then setting out for Pylos ."""	τὸν δʼ υἱὸς Φρονίοιο Νοήμων ἀντίον ηὔδα· αὐτὸς ἑκών οἱ δῶκα· τί κεν ῥέξειε καὶ ἄλλος, ὁππότʼ ἀνὴρ τοιοῦτος ἔχων μελεδήματα θυμῷ αἰτίζῃ; χαλεπόν κεν ἀνήνασθαι δόσιν εἴη. κοῦροι δʼ, οἳ κατὰ δῆμον ἀριστεύουσι μεθʼ ἡμέας, οἵ οἱ ἕποντʼ· ἐν δʼ ἀρχὸν ἐγὼ βαίνοντʼ ἐνόησα Μέντορα, ἠὲ θεόν, τῷ δʼ αὐτῷ πάντα ἐῴκει. ἀλλὰ τὸ θαυμάζω· ἴδον ἐνθάδε Μέντορα δῖον χθιζὸν ὑπηοῖον, τότε δʼ ἔμβη νηὶ Πύλονδε.
Noemon then went back to his father's house, but Antinoos and Eurymakhos were very angry. They told the others to leave off competing  , and to come and sit down along with themselves. When they came, Antinoos son of Eupeithes spoke in anger. His heart was black with rage, and his eyes flashed fire as he said:	ὣς ἄρα φωνήσας ἀπέβη πρὸς δώματα πατρός, τοῖσιν δʼ ἀμφοτέροισιν ἀγάσσατο θυμὸς ἀγήνωρ. μνηστῆρας δʼ ἄμυδις κάθισαν καὶ παῦσαν ἀέθλων. τοῖσιν δʼ Ἀντίνοος μετέφη Εὐπείθεος υἱός, ἀχνύμενος· μένεος δὲ μέγα φρένες ἀμφιμέλαιναι πίμπλαντʼ, ὄσσε δέ οἱ πυρὶ λαμπετόωντι ἐίκτην·
"""Good heavens, this voyage of Telemakhos is a very serious matter; we had made sure that it would come to nothing, but the young man has got away in spite of us, and with a crew picked   from the best of the , too. He will be giving us trouble presently; may Zeus destroy him with violence   before he is full grown. Find me a ship, therefore, with a crew of twenty men, and I will lie in wait for him in the straits between Ithaca and Samos ; he will then rue the day that he set out to try and get news of his father."""	ὢ πόποι, ἦ μέγα ἔργον ὑπερφιάλως ἐτελέσθη Τηλεμάχῳ ὁδὸς ἥδε· φάμεν δέ οἱ οὐ τελέεσθαι. ἐκ τοσσῶνδʼ ἀέκητι νέος πάϊς οἴχεται αὔτως νῆα ἐρυσσάμενος, κρίνας τʼ ἀνὰ δῆμον ἀρίστους. ἄρξει καὶ προτέρω κακὸν ἔμμεναι· ἀλλά οἱ αὐτῷ Ζεὺς ὀλέσειε βίην, πρὶν ἥβης μέτρον ἱκέσθαι. ἀλλʼ ἄγε μοι δότε νῆα θοὴν καὶ εἴκοσʼ ἑταίρους, ὄφρα μιν αὐτὸν ἰόντα λοχήσομαι ἠδὲ φυλάξω ἐν πορθμῷ Ἰθάκης τε Σάμοιό τε παιπαλοέσσης, ὡς ἂν ἐπισμυγερῶς ναυτίλλεται εἵνεκα πατρός.
Thus did he speak, and the others applauded his saying; they then all of them went inside the buildings.	ὣς ἔφαθʼ, οἱ δʼ ἄρα πάντες ἐπῄνεον ἠδʼ ἐκέλευον. αὐτίκʼ ἔπειτʼ ἀνστάντες ἔβαν δόμον εἰς Ὀδυσῆος.
"It was not long ere Penelope came to know what the suitors were plotting; for a man servant, Medon, overheard them from outside the outer court as they were laying their schemes within, and went to tell his mistress. As he crossed the threshold of her room Penelope said: ""Medon, what have the suitors sent you here for? Is it to tell the maids to leave their master's business and cook dinner for them? I wish they may neither woo nor dine henceforward, neither here nor anywhere else, but let this be the very last time, for the waste you all make of my son's estate. Did not your fathers tell you when you were children how good Odysseus had been to them - never doing anything high-handed, nor speaking harshly to anybody in the ? Such is the justice   of divine kings: they may take a fancy to one man and dislike another, but Odysseus never did an unjust thing by anybody - which shows what bad hearts you have, and that there is no such thing as gratitude   left in this world."""	οὐδʼ ἄρα Πηνελόπεια πολὺν χρόνον ἦεν ἄπυστος μύθων, οὓς μνηστῆρες ἐνὶ φρεσὶ βυσσοδόμευον· κῆρυξ γάρ οἱ ἔειπε Μέδων, ὃς ἐπεύθετο βουλὰς αὐλῆς ἐκτὸς ἐών· οἱ δʼ ἔνδοθι μῆτιν ὕφαινον. βῆ δʼ ἴμεν ἀγγελέων διὰ δώματα Πηνελοπείῃ· τὸν δὲ κατʼ οὐδοῦ βάντα προσηύδα Πηνελόπεια· κῆρυξ, τίπτε δέ σε πρόεσαν μνηστῆρες ἀγαυοί; ἦ εἰπέμεναι δμῳῇσιν Ὀδυσσῆος θείοιο ἔργων παύσασθαι, σφίσι δʼ αὐτοῖς δαῖτα πένεσθαι; μὴ μνηστεύσαντες μηδʼ ἄλλοθʼ ὁμιλήσαντες ὕστατα καὶ πύματα νῦν ἐνθάδε δειπνήσειαν· οἳ θάμʼ ἀγειρόμενοι βίοτον κατακείρετε πολλόν, κτῆσιν Τηλεμάχοιο δαΐφρονος· οὐδέ τι πατρῶν ὑμετέρων τὸ πρόσθεν ἀκούετε, παῖδες ἐόντες, οἷος Ὀδυσσεὺς ἔσκε μεθʼ ὑμετέροισι τοκεῦσιν, οὔτε τινὰ ῥέξας ἐξαίσιον οὔτε τι εἰπὼν ἐν δήμῳ, ἥ τʼ ἐστὶ δίκη θείων βασιλήων· ἄλλον κʼ ἐχθαίρῃσι βροτῶν, ἄλλον κε φιλοίη. κεῖνος δʼ οὔ ποτε πάμπαν ἀτάσθαλον ἄνδρα ἐώργει. ἀλλʼ ὁ μὲν ὑμέτερος θυμὸς καὶ ἀεικέα ἔργα φαίνεται, οὐδέ τίς ἐστι χάρις μετόπισθʼ ἐυεργέων.
"Then Medon said, ""I wish, my lady, that this were all; but they are plotting something much more dreadful now - may heaven frustrate their design. They are going to try and murder Telemakhos as he is coming home from Pylos and Lacedaemon , where he has been to get news of his father."""	τὴν δʼ αὖτε προσέειπε Μέδων πεπνυμένα εἰδώς· αἲ γὰρ δή, βασίλεια, τόδε πλεῖστον κακὸν εἴη. ἀλλὰ πολὺ μεῖζόν τε καὶ ἀργαλεώτερον ἄλλο μνηστῆρες φράζονται, ὃ μὴ τελέσειε Κρονίων· Τηλέμαχον μεμάασι κατακτάμεν ὀξέι χαλκῷ οἴκαδε νισόμενον· ὁ δʼ ἔβη μετὰ πατρὸς ἀκουὴν ἐς Πύλον ἠγαθέην ἠδʼ ἐς Λακεδαίμονα δῖαν.
"Then Penelope's heart sank within her, and for a long time she was speechless; her eyes filled with tears, and she could find no utterance. At last, however, she said, ""Why did my son leave me? What business had he to go sailing off in ships that make long voyages over the ocean like sea-horses? Does he want to die without leaving any one behind him to keep up his name?"""	ὣς φάτο, τῆς δʼ αὐτοῦ λύτο γούνατα καὶ φίλον ἦτορ, δὴν δέ μιν ἀμφασίη ἐπέων λάβε· τὼ δέ οἱ ὄσσε δακρυόφι πλῆσθεν, θαλερὴ δέ οἱ ἔσχετο φωνή. ὀψὲ δὲ δή μιν ἔπεσσιν ἀμειβομένη προσέειπε· κῆρυξ, τίπτε δέ μοι πάϊς οἴχεται; οὐδέ τί μιν χρεὼ νηῶν ὠκυπόρων ἐπιβαινέμεν, αἵ θʼ ἁλὸς ἵπποι ἀνδράσι γίγνονται, περόωσι δὲ πουλὺν ἐφʼ ὑγρήν. ἦ ἵνα μηδʼ ὄνομʼ αὐτοῦ ἐν ἀνθρώποισι λίπηται;
"""I do not know,"" answered Medon, ""whether some god set him on to it, or whether he went on his own impulse to see if he could find out if his father was dead, or alive and on his way home  ."""	τὴν δʼ ἠμείβετʼ ἔπειτα Μέδων πεπνυμένα εἰδώς· οὐκ οἶδʼ ἤ τίς μιν θεὸς ὤρορεν, ἦε καὶ αὐτοῦ θυμὸς ἐφωρμήθη ἴμεν ἐς Πύλον, ὄφρα πύθηται πατρὸς ἑοῦ ἢ νόστον ἢ ὅν τινα πότμον ἐπέσπεν.
Then he went downstairs again, leaving Penelope in an agony of grief  . There were plenty of seats in the house, but she had no heart for sitting on any one of them; she could only fling herself on the floor of her own room and cry; whereon all the maids in the house, both old and young, gathered round her and began to cry too, till at last in a transport of sorrow she exclaimed,	ὣς ἄρα φωνήσας ἀπέβη κατὰ δῶμʼ Ὀδυσῆος. τὴν δʼ ἄχος ἀμφεχύθη θυμοφθόρον, οὐδʼ ἄρʼ ἔτʼ ἔτλη δίφρῳ ἐφέζεσθαι πολλῶν κατὰ οἶκον ἐόντων, ἀλλʼ ἄρʼ ἐπʼ οὐδοῦ ἷζε πολυκμήτου θαλάμοιο οἴκτρʼ ὀλοφυρομένη· περὶ δὲ δμῳαὶ μινύριζον πᾶσαι, ὅσαι κατὰ δώματʼ ἔσαν νέαι ἠδὲ παλαιαί. τῇς δʼ ἁδινὸν γοόωσα μετηύδα Πηνελόπεια·

First I lost my brave and lion-hearted husband, who had every good quality   under heaven, and whose was great over all Hellas and middle Argos ; and now my darling son is at the mercy of the winds and waves, without my having heard one word about his leaving home. You hussies, there was not one of you would so much as think of giving me a call out of my bed, though you all of you very well knew when he was starting. If I had known he meant taking this voyage, he would have had to give it up, no matter how much he was bent upon it, or leave me a corpse behind him - one or other. Now, however, go some of you and call old Dolios, who was given me by my father on my marriage, and who is my gardener. Bid him go at once and tell everything to Laertes , who may be able to hit on some plan for enlisting public sympathy on our side, as against those who are trying to exterminate his own race and that of Odysseus."""	κλῦτε, φίλαι· πέρι γάρ μοι Ὀλύμπιος ἄλγεʼ ἔδωκεν ἐκ πασέων, ὅσσαι μοι ὁμοῦ τράφεν ἠδʼ ἐγένοντο· ἣ πρὶν μὲν πόσιν ἐσθλὸν ἀπώλεσα θυμολέοντα, παντοίῃς ἀρετῇσι κεκασμένον ἐν Δαναοῖσιν, ἐσθλόν, τοῦ κλέος εὐρὺ καθʼ Ἑλλάδα καὶ μέσον Ἄργος. νῦν αὖ παῖδʼ ἀγαπητὸν ἀνηρείψαντο θύελλαι ἀκλέα ἐκ μεγάρων, οὐδʼ ὁρμηθέντος ἄκουσα. σχέτλιαι, οὐδʼ ὑμεῖς περ ἐνὶ φρεσὶ θέσθε ἑκάστη ἐκ λεχέων μʼ ἀνεγεῖραι, ἐπιστάμεναι σάφα θυμῷ, ὁππότʼ ἐκεῖνος ἔβη κοίλην ἐπὶ νῆα μέλαιναν. εἰ γὰρ ἐγὼ πυθόμην ταύτην ὁδὸν ὁρμαίνοντα, τῷ κε μάλʼ ἤ κεν ἔμεινε καὶ ἐσσύμενός περ ὁδοῖο, ἤ κέ με τεθνηκυῖαν ἐνὶ μεγάροισιν ἔλειπεν. ἀλλά τις ὀτρηρῶς Δολίον καλέσειε γέροντα, δμῶʼ ἐμόν, ὅν μοι δῶκε πατὴρ ἔτι δεῦρο κιούσῃ, καί μοι κῆπον ἔχει πολυδένδρεον, ὄφρα τάχιστα Λαέρτῃ τάδε πάντα παρεζόμενος καταλέξῃ, εἰ δή πού τινα κεῖνος ἐνὶ φρεσὶ μῆτιν ὑφήνας ἐξελθὼν λαοῖσιν ὀδύρεται, οἳ μεμάασιν ὃν καὶ Ὀδυσσῆος φθῖσαι γόνον ἀντιθέοιο.
"Then the dear old nurse Eurykleia said, ""You may kill me, my lady, or let me live on in your house, whichever you please, but I will tell you the real truth. I knew all about it, and gave him everything he wanted in the way of bread and wine, but he made me take my solemn oath that I would not tell you anything for some ten or twelve days, unless you asked or happened to hear of his having gone, for he did not want you to spoil your beauty by crying. And now, my lady, wash your face, change your dress, and go upstairs with your maids to offer prayers to Athena, daughter of Aegis-bearing Zeus, for she can save him even though he be in the jaws of death. Do not trouble Laertes: he has trouble enough already. Besides, I cannot think that the gods hate the race of the son of Arceisius so much, but there will be a son left to come up after him, and inherit both the house and the fair fields that lie far all round it."""	τὴν δʼ αὖτε προσέειπε φίλη τροφὸς Εὐρύκλεια· νύμφα φίλη, σὺ μὲν ἄρ με κατάκτανε νηλέι χαλκῷ ἢ ἔα ἐν μεγάρῳ· μῦθον δέ τοι οὐκ ἐπικεύσω. ᾔδεʼ ἐγὼ τάδε πάντα, πόρον δέ οἱ ὅσσʼ ἐκέλευε, σῖτον καὶ μέθυ ἡδύ· ἐμεῦ δʼ ἕλετο μέγαν ὅρκον μὴ πρὶν σοὶ ἐρέειν, πρὶν δωδεκάτην γε γενέσθαι ἢ σʼ αὐτὴν ποθέσαι καὶ ἀφορμηθέντος ἀκοῦσαι, ὡς ἂν μὴ κλαίουσα κατὰ χρόα καλὸν ἰάπτῃς. ἀλλʼ ὑδρηναμένη, καθαρὰ χροῒ εἵμαθʼ ἑλοῦσα, εἰς ὑπερῷʼ ἀναβᾶσα σὺν ἀμφιπόλοισι γυναιξὶν εὔχεʼ Ἀθηναίῃ κούρῃ Διὸς αἰγιόχοιο· ἡ γάρ κέν μιν ἔπειτα καὶ ἐκ θανάτοιο σαώσαι. μηδὲ γέροντα κάκου κεκακωμένον· οὐ γὰρ ὀίω πάγχυ θεοῖς μακάρεσσι γονὴν Ἀρκεισιάδαο ἔχθεσθʼ, ἀλλʼ ἔτι πού τις ἐπέσσεται ὅς κεν ἔχῃσι δώματά θʼ ὑψερεφέα καὶ ἀπόπροθι πίονας ἀγρούς.
With these words she made her mistress leave off crying, and dried the tears from her eyes. Penelope washed her face, changed her dress, and went upstairs with her maids. She then put some bruised barley into a basket and began praying to Athena.	ὣς φάτο, τῆς δʼ εὔνησε γόον, σχέθε δʼ ὄσσε γόοιο. ἡ δʼ ὑδρηναμένη, καθαρὰ χροῒ εἵμαθʼ ἑλοῦσα εἰς ὑπερῷʼ ἀνέβαινε σὺν ἀμφιπόλοισι γυναιξίν, ἐν δʼ ἔθετʼ οὐλοχύτας κανέῳ, ἠρᾶτο δʼ Ἀθήνῃ·

She cried aloud as she spoke, and the goddess heard her prayer; meanwhile the suitors were clamorous throughout the covered room, and one of them said:	ὣς εἰποῦσʼ ὀλόλυξε, θεὰ δέ οἱ ἔκλυεν ἀρῆς. μνηστῆρες δʼ ὁμάδησαν ἀνὰ μέγαρα σκιόεντα· ὧδε δέ τις εἴπεσκε νέων ὑπερηνορεόντων·

"This was what they said, but they did not know what was going to happen. Then Antinoos said, ""Comrades, let there be no loud talking, lest some of it get carried inside. Let us be up and do that in silence, about which we are all of a mind."""	ὣς ἄρα τις εἴπεσκε, τὰ δʼ οὐκ ἴσαν ὡς ἐτέτυκτο. τοῖσιν δʼ Ἀντίνοος ἀγορήσατο καὶ μετέειπε· δαιμόνιοι, μύθους μὲν ὑπερφιάλους ἀλέασθε πάντας ὁμῶς, μή πού τις ἀπαγγείλῃσι καὶ εἴσω. ἀλλʼ ἄγε σιγῇ τοῖον ἀναστάντες τελέωμεν μῦθον, ὃ δὴ καὶ πᾶσιν ἐνὶ φρεσὶν ἤραρεν ἡμῖν.
He then chose   twenty men, and they went down to their ship and to the sea side; they drew the vessel into the water and got her mast and sails inside her; they bound the oars to the thole-pins with twisted thongs of leather, all in due course, and spread the white sails aloft, while their fine servants brought them their armor. Then they made the ship fast a little way out, came on shore again, got their suppers, and waited till night should fall.	ὣς εἰπὼν ἐκρίνατʼ ἐείκοσι φῶτας ἀρίστους, βὰν δʼ ἰέναι ἐπὶ νῆα θοὴν καὶ θῖνα θαλάσσης. νῆα μὲν οὖν πάμπρωτον ἁλὸς βένθοσδε ἔρυσσαν, ἐν δʼ ἱστόν τʼ ἐτίθεντο καὶ ἱστία νηὶ μελαίνῃ, ἠρτύναντο δʼ ἐρετμὰ τροποῖς ἐν δερματίνοισιν, πάντα κατὰ μοῖραν, ἀνά θʼ ἱστία λευκὰ πέτασσαν· τεύχεα δέ σφʼ ἤνεικαν ὑπέρθυμοι θεράποντες. ὑψοῦ δʼ ἐν νοτίῳ τήν γʼ ὥρμισαν, ἐκ δʼ ἔβαν αὐτοί· ἔνθα δὲ δόρπον ἕλοντο, μένον δʼ ἐπὶ ἕσπερον ἐλθεῖν.
But Penelope lay in her own room upstairs unable to eat or drink, and wondering whether her brave son would escape, or be overpowered by the wicked suitors. Like a lioness caught in the toils with huntsmen hemming her in on every side she thought and thought till she sank into a slumber, and lay on her bed bereft of thought and motion.	ἡ δʼ ὑπερωίῳ αὖθι περίφρων Πηνελόπεια κεῖτʼ ἄρʼ ἄσιτος, ἄπαστος ἐδητύος ἠδὲ ποτῆτος, ὁρμαίνουσʼ ἤ οἱ θάνατον φύγοι υἱὸς ἀμύμων, ἦ ὅ γʼ ὑπὸ μνηστῆρσιν ὑπερφιάλοισι δαμείη. ὅσσα δὲ μερμήριξε λέων ἀνδρῶν ἐν ὁμίλῳ δείσας, ὁππότε μιν δόλιον περὶ κύκλον ἄγωσι, τόσσα μιν ὁρμαίνουσαν ἐπήλυθε νήδυμος ὕπνος· εὗδε δʼ ἀνακλινθεῖσα, λύθεν δέ οἱ ἅψεα πάντα.
Then Athena bethought her of another matter, and made a vision in the likeness of Penelope's sister Iphthime daughter of Ikarios who had married Eumelos and lived in Pherai . She told the vision to go to the house of Odysseus, and to make Penelope leave off crying, so it came into her room by the hole through which the thong went for pulling the door to, and hovered over her head, saying,	ἔνθʼ αὖτʼ ἄλλʼ ἐνόησε θεά, γλαυκῶπις Ἀθήνη· εἴδωλον ποίησε, δέμας δʼ ἤικτο γυναικί, Ἰφθίμῃ, κούρῃ μεγαλήτορος Ἰκαρίοιο, τὴν Εὔμηλος ὄπυιε Φερῇς ἔνι οἰκία ναίων. πέμπε δέ μιν πρὸς δώματʼ Ὀδυσσῆος θείοιο, ἧος Πηνελόπειαν ὀδυρομένην γοόωσαν παύσειε κλαυθμοῖο γόοιό τε δακρυόεντος. ἐς θάλαμον δʼ εἰσῆλθε παρὰ κληῖδος ἱμάντα, στῆ δʼ ἄρʼ ὑπὲρ κεφαλῆς, καί μιν πρὸς μῦθον ἔειπεν·
"""You are asleep, Penelope: the gods who live at ease will not suffer you to weep and be so sad. Your son has done them no wrong, so he will yet come back to you."""	εὕδεις, Πηνελόπεια, φίλον τετιημένη ἦτορ; οὐ μέν σʼ οὐδὲ ἐῶσι θεοὶ ῥεῖα ζώοντες κλαίειν οὐδʼ ἀκάχησθαι, ἐπεί ῥʼ ἔτι νόστιμός ἐστι σὸς παῖς· οὐ μὲν γάρ τι θεοῖς ἀλιτήμενός ἐστι.
"Penelope, who was sleeping sweetly at the gates of dreamland, answered, ""Sister, why have you come here? You do not come very often, but I suppose that is because you live such a long way off. Am I, then, to leave off crying and refrain from all the sad thoughts that torture me? I, who have lost my brave and lion-hearted husband, who had every good quality   under heaven, and whose was great over all Hellas and middle Argos ; and now my darling son has gone off on board of a ship - a foolish man who has never been used to undergoing ordeals  , nor to going about among gatherings of men. I am even more anxious about him than about my husband; I am all in a tremble when I think of him, lest something should happen to him, either from the people in the where he has gone, or at sea, for he has many enemies who are plotting against him, and are bent on killing him before he can return home."""	τὴν δʼ ἠμείβετʼ ἔπειτα περίφρων Πηνελόπεια, ἡδὺ μάλα κνώσσουσʼ ἐν ὀνειρείῃσι πύλῃσιν· τίπτε, κασιγνήτη, δεῦρʼ ἤλυθες; οὔ τι πάρος γε πωλέʼ, ἐπεὶ μάλα πολλὸν ἀπόπροθι δώματα ναίεις· καί με κέλεαι παύσασθαι ὀιζύος ἠδʼ ὀδυνάων πολλέων, αἵ μʼ ἐρέθουσι κατὰ φρένα καὶ κατὰ θυμόν, ἣ πρὶν μὲν πόσιν ἐσθλὸν ἀπώλεσα θυμολέοντα, παντοίῃς ἀρετῇσι κεκασμένον ἐν Δαναοῖσιν, ἐσθλόν, τοῦ κλέος εὐρὺ καθʼ Ἑλλάδα καὶ μέσον Ἄργος· νῦν αὖ παῖς ἀγαπητὸς ἔβη κοίλης ἐπὶ νηός, νήπιος, οὔτε πόνων ἐὺ εἰδὼς οὔτʼ ἀγοράων. τοῦ δὴ ἐγὼ καὶ μᾶλλον ὀδύρομαι ἤ περ ἐκείνου· τοῦ δʼ ἀμφιτρομέω καὶ δείδια, μή τι πάθῃσιν, ἢ ὅ γε τῶν ἐνὶ δήμῳ, ἵνʼ οἴχεται, ἢ ἐνὶ πόντῳ· δυσμενέες γὰρ πολλοὶ ἐπʼ αὐτῷ μηχανόωνται, ἱέμενοι κτεῖναι πρὶν πατρίδα γαῖαν ἱκέσθαι.
"Then the vision said, ""Take heart, and be not so much dismayed. There is one gone with him whom many a man would be glad enough to have stand by his side, I mean Athena; it is she who has compassion upon you, and who has sent me to bear you this message."""	τὴν δʼ ἀπαμειβόμενον προσέφη εἴδωλον ἀμαυρόν· θάρσει, μηδέ τι πάγχυ μετὰ φρεσὶ δείδιθι λίην· τοίη γάρ οἱ πομπὸς ἅμʼ ἔρχεται, ἥν τε καὶ ἄλλοι ἀνέρες ἠρήσαντο παρεστάμεναι, δύναται γάρ, Παλλὰς Ἀθηναίη· σὲ δʼ ὀδυρομένην ἐλεαίρει· ἣ νῦν με προέηκε τεῒν τάδε μυθήσασθαι.
"""Then,"" said Penelope, ""if you are a god or have been sent here by divine commission, tell me also about that other unhappy one - is he still alive, or is he already dead and in the house of Hades?"""	τὴν δʼ αὖτε προσέειπε περίφρων Πηνελόπεια· εἰ μὲν δὴ θεός ἐσσι θεοῖό τε ἔκλυες αὐδῆς, εἰ δʼ ἄγε μοι καὶ κεῖνον ὀιζυρὸν κατάλεξον, ἤ που ἔτι ζώει καὶ ὁρᾷ φάος ἠελίοιο, ἦ ἤδη τέθνηκε καὶ εἰν Ἀίδαο δόμοισι.
"And the vision said, ""I shall not tell you for certain whether he is alive or dead, and there is no use in idle conversation."""	τὴν δʼ ἀπαμειβόμενον προσέφη εἴδωλον ἀμαυρόν· οὐ μέν τοι κεῖνόν γε διηνεκέως ἀγορεύσω, ζώει ὅ γʼ ἦ τέθνηκε· κακὸν δʼ ἀνεμώλια βάζειν.
Then it vanished through the thong-hole of the door and was dissipated into thin air; but Penelope rose from her sleep refreshed and comforted, so vivid had been her dream.	ὣς εἰπὸν σταθμοῖο παρὰ κληῖδα λιάσθη ἐς πνοιὰς ἀνέμων. ἡ δʼ ἐξ ὕπνου ἀνόρουσε κούρη Ἰκαρίοιο· φίλον δέ οἱ ἦτορ ἰάνθη, ὥς οἱ ἐναργὲς ὄνειρον ἐπέσσυτο νυκτὸς ἀμολγῷ.
Meantime the suitors went on board and sailed their ways over the sea, intent on murdering Telemakhos. Now there is a rocky islet called Asteris, of no great size, in mid channel between Ithaca and Samos , and there is a harbor on either side of it where a ship can lie. Here then the Achaeans placed themselves in ambush.	μνηστῆρες δʼ ἀναβάντες ἐπέπλεον ὑγρὰ κέλευθα Τηλεμάχῳ φόνον αἰπὺν ἐνὶ φρεσὶν ὁρμαίνοντες. ἔστι δέ τις νῆσος μέσσῃ ἁλὶ πετρήεσσα, μεσσηγὺς Ἰθάκης τε Σάμοιό τε παιπαλοέσσης, Ἀστερίς, οὐ μεγάλη· λιμένες δʼ ἔνι ναύλοχοι αὐτῇ ἀμφίδυμοι· τῇ τόν γε μένον λοχόωντες Ἀχαιοί.
And now, as Dawn rose from her couch beside Tithonos - harbinger of light alike to mortals and immortals - the gods met in council and with them, Zeus the lord of thunder, who is their king. Thereon Athena began to tell them of the many sufferings of Odysseus, for she pitied him away there in the house of the nymph Calypso.	Ἠὼς δʼ ἐκ λεχέων παρʼ ἀγαυοῦ Τιθωνοῖο ὤρνυθʼ, ἵνʼ ἀθανάτοισι φόως φέροι ἠδὲ βροτοῖσιν· οἱ δὲ θεοὶ θῶκόνδε καθίζανον, ἐν δʼ ἄρα τοῖσι Ζεὺς ὑψιβρεμέτης, οὗ τε κράτος ἐστὶ μέγιστον. τοῖσι δʼ Ἀθηναίη λέγε κήδεα πόλλʼ Ὀδυσῆος μνησαμένη· μέλε γάρ οἱ ἐὼν ἐν δώμασι νύμφης·
"""Father Zeus,"" said she, ""and all you other gods that live in everlasting bliss, I hope there may never be such a thing as a kind and well-disposed ruler any more, nor one who will govern equitably. I hope they will be all henceforth cruel and unjust, for there is not one of his subjects who has not forgotten Odysseus, who ruled them as though he were their father. There he is, lying in great pain in an island where dwells the nymph Calypso, who will not let him go; and he cannot get back to his own country, for he can find neither ships nor sailors to take him over the sea. Furthermore, wicked people are now trying to murder his only son Telemakhos, who is coming home from Pylos and Lacedaemon , where he has been to see if he can get news of his father."""

"""What, my dear, are you talking about?"" replied her father. ""Did you not send him there yourself, because you thought   it would help Odysseus to get home and punish the suitors? Besides, you are perfectly able to protect Telemakhos, and to see him safely home again, while the suitors have to come hurrying back without having killed him."""	τὴν δʼ ἀπαμειβόμενος προσέφη νεφεληγερέτα Ζεύς· τέκνον ἐμόν, ποῖόν σε ἔπος φύγεν ἕρκος ὀδόντων. οὐ γὰρ δὴ τοῦτον μὲν ἐβούλευσας νόον αὐτή, ὡς ἦ τοι κείνους Ὀδυσεὺς ἀποτίσεται ἐλθών; Τηλέμαχον δὲ σὺ πέμψον ἐπισταμένως, δύνασαι γάρ, ὥς κε μάλʼ ἀσκηθὴς ἣν πατρίδα γαῖαν ἵκηται, μνηστῆρες δʼ ἐν νηὶ· παλιμπετὲς ἀπονέωνται.
"When he had thus spoken, he said to his son Hermes, ""Hermes, you are our messenger, go therefore and tell Calypso we have decreed that poor Odysseus is to return home  . He is to be convoyed neither by gods nor men, but after a perilous voyage of twenty days upon a raft he is to reach fertile Scheria , the land of the Phaeacians, who are near of kin to the gods, and will honor him as though he were one of ourselves. They will send him in a ship to his own country, and will give him more bronze and gold and raiment than he would have brought back from Troy , if he had had all his prize wealth and had got home without disaster. This is how we have settled that he shall return to his country and his friends."""	ἦ ῥα καὶ Ἑρμείαν, υἱὸν φίλον, ἀντίον ηὔδα· Ἑρμεία, σὺ γὰρ αὖτε τά τʼ ἄλλα περ ἄγγελός ἐσσι, νύμφῃ ἐυπλοκάμῳ εἰπεῖν νημερτέα βουλήν, νόστον Ὀδυσσῆος ταλασίφρονος, ὥς κε νέηται οὔτε θεῶν πομπῇ οὔτε θνητῶν ἀνθρώπων· ἀλλʼ ὅ γʼ ἐπὶ σχεδίης πολυδέσμου πήματα πάσχων ἤματί κʼ εἰκοστῷ Σχερίην ἐρίβωλον ἵκοιτο, Φαιήκων ἐς γαῖαν, οἳ ἀγχίθεοι γεγάασιν, οἵ κέν μιν περὶ κῆρι θεὸν ὣς τιμήσουσιν, πέμψουσιν δʼ ἐν νηὶ φίλην ἐς πατρίδα γαῖαν, χαλκόν τε χρυσόν τε ἅλις ἐσθῆτά τε δόντες, πόλλʼ, ὅσʼ ἂν οὐδέ ποτε Τροίης ἐξήρατʼ Ὀδυσσεύς, εἴ περ ἀπήμων ἦλθε, λαχὼν ἀπὸ ληίδος αἶσαν. ὣς γάρ οἱ μοῖρʼ ἐστὶ φίλους τʼ ἰδέειν καὶ ἱκέσθαι οἶκον ἐς ὑψόροφον καὶ ἑὴν ἐς πατρίδα γαῖαν.
Thus he spoke, and Hermes, guide and guardian, slayer of Argos , did as he was told. Forthwith he bound on his glittering golden sandals with which he could fly like the wind over land and sea. He took the wand with which he seals men's eyes in sleep or wakes them just as he pleases, and flew holding it in his hand over Pieria ; then he swooped down through the firmament till he reached the level of the sea, whose waves he skimmed like a cormorant that flies fishing every hole and corner of the ocean, and drenching its thick plumage in the spray. He flew and flew over many a weary wave, but when at last he got to the island which was his journey's end, he left the sea and went on by land till he came to the cave where the nymph Calypso lived.	ὣς ἔφατʼ, οὐδʼ ἀπίθησε διάκτορος ἀργεϊφόντης. αὐτίκʼ ἔπειθʼ ὑπὸ ποσσὶν ἐδήσατο καλὰ πέδιλα, ἀμβρόσια χρύσεια, τά μιν φέρον ἠμὲν ἐφʼ ὑγρὴν ἠδʼ ἐπʼ ἀπείρονα γαῖαν ἅμα πνοιῇς ἀνέμοιο. εἵλετο δὲ ῥάβδον, τῇ τʼ ἀνδρῶν ὄμματα θέλγει, ὧν ἐθέλει, τοὺς δʼ αὖτε καὶ ὑπνώοντας ἐγείρει. τὴν μετὰ χερσὶν ἔχων πέτετο κρατὺς ἀργεϊφόντης.

He found her at home. There was a large fire burning on the hearth, and one could smell from far the fragrant reek of burning cedar and sandal wood. As for herself, she was busy at her loom, shooting her golden shuttle through the warp and singing beautifully. Round her cave there was a thick wood of alder, poplar, and sweet smelling cypress trees, wherein all kinds of great birds had built their nests - owls, hawks, and chattering sea-crows that have their business in the waters. A vine loaded with grapes was trained and grew luxuriantly about the mouth of the cave; there were also four running rills of water in channels cut pretty close together, and turned here and there so as to irrigate the beds of violets and luscious herbage over which they flowed. Even a god could not help being charmed with such a lovely spot, so Hermes stood still and looked at it; but when he had admired it sufficiently he went inside the cave.	ναῖεν ἐυπλόκαμος· τὴν δʼ ἔνδοθι τέτμεν ἐοῦσαν. πῦρ μὲν ἐπʼ ἐσχαρόφιν μέγα καίετο, τηλόσε δʼ ὀδμὴ κέδρου τʼ εὐκεάτοιο θύου τʼ ἀνὰ νῆσον ὀδώδει δαιομένων· ἡ δʼ ἔνδον ἀοιδιάουσʼ ὀπὶ καλῇ ἱστὸν ἐποιχομένη χρυσείῃ κερκίδʼ ὕφαινεν. ὕλη δὲ σπέος ἀμφὶ πεφύκει τηλεθόωσα, κλήθρη τʼ αἴγειρός τε καὶ εὐώδης κυπάρισσος. ἔνθα δέ τʼ ὄρνιθες τανυσίπτεροι εὐνάζοντο, σκῶπές τʼ ἴρηκές τε τανύγλωσσοί τε κορῶναι εἰνάλιαι, τῇσίν τε θαλάσσια ἔργα μέμηλεν. ἡ δʼ αὐτοῦ τετάνυστο περὶ σπείους γλαφυροῖο ἡμερὶς ἡβώωσα, τεθήλει δὲ σταφυλῇσι. κρῆναι δʼ ἑξείης πίσυρες ῥέον ὕδατι λευκῷ, πλησίαι ἀλλήλων τετραμμέναι ἄλλυδις ἄλλη. ἀμφὶ δὲ λειμῶνες μαλακοὶ ἴου ἠδὲ σελίνου θήλεον. ἔνθα κʼ ἔπειτα καὶ ἀθάνατός περ ἐπελθὼν θηήσαιτο ἰδὼν καὶ τερφθείη φρεσὶν ᾗσιν. ἔνθα στὰς θηεῖτο διάκτορος ἀργεϊφόντης. αὐτὰρ ἐπεὶ δὴ πάντα ἑῷ θηήσατο θυμῷ,
"Calypso knew him at once - for the gods all know each other, no matter how far they live from one another - but Odysseus was not within; he was on the sea-shore as usual, looking out upon the barren ocean with tears in his eyes, groaning and breaking his heart for sorrow. Calypso gave Hermes a seat and said: ""Why have you come to see me, Hermes - honored, and ever welcome - for you do not visit me often? Say what you want; I will do it for you at once if I can, and if it can be done at all; but come inside, and let me set refreshment before you."	αὐτίκʼ ἄρʼ εἰς εὐρὺ σπέος ἤλυθεν. οὐδέ μιν ἄντην ἠγνοίησεν ἰδοῦσα Καλυψώ, δῖα θεάων· οὐ γάρ τʼ ἀγνῶτες θεοὶ ἀλλήλοισι πέλονται ἀθάνατοι, οὐδʼ εἴ τις ἀπόπροθι δώματα ναίει. οὐδʼ ἄρʼ Ὀδυσσῆα μεγαλήτορα ἔνδον ἔτετμεν, ἀλλʼ ὅ γʼ ἐπʼ ἀκτῆς κλαῖε καθήμενος, ἔνθα πάρος περ, δάκρυσι καὶ στοναχῇσι καὶ ἄλγεσι θυμὸν ἐρέχθων. πόντον ἐπʼ ἀτρύγετον δερκέσκετο δάκρυα λείβων.

As she spoke she drew a table loaded with ambrosia beside him and mixed him some red nectar, so Hermes ate and drank till he had had enough, and then said:	ὥς ἄρα φωνήσασα θεὰ παρέθηκε τράπεζαν ἀμβροσίης πλήσασα, κέρασσε δὲ νέκταρ ἐρυθρόν. αὐτὰρ ὁ πῖνε καὶ ἦσθε διάκτορος ἀργεϊφόντης. αὐτὰρ ἐπεὶ δείπνησε καὶ ἤραρε θυμὸν ἐδωδῇ, καὶ τότε δή μιν ἔπεσσιν ἀμειβόμενος προσέειπεν·
"""We are speaking god and goddess to one another, one another, and you ask me why I have come here, and I will tell you truly as you would have me do. Zeus sent me; it was no doing of mine; who could possibly want to come all this way over the sea where there are no cities full of people to offer me sacrifices or choice hecatombs? Nevertheless I had to come, for none of us other gods can cross Zeus, nor transgress his orders his . He says that you have here the most ill-starred of all those who fought nine years before the city of King Priam and sailed home in the tenth year after having sacked it. On their way home   they erred against Athena, who raised both wind and waves against them, so that all his brave companions perished, and he alone was carried here by wind and tide. Zeus says that you are to let this by man go at once, for it is decreed that he shall not perish here, far from his own people, but shall return to his house and country and see his friends again."""	εἰρωτᾷς μʼ ἐλθόντα θεὰ θεόν· αὐτὰρ ἐγώ τοι νημερτέως τὸν μῦθον ἐνισπήσω· κέλεαι γάρ.

"Calypso trembled with rage when she heard this, ""You gods,"" she exclaimed, ""ought to be ashamed of yourselves. You are always jealous and hate seeing a goddess take a fancy to a mortal man, and live with him in open matrimony. So when rosy-fingered Dawn made love to Orion, you precious gods were all of you furious till Artemis went and killed him in Ortygia. So again when Demeter fell in love with Iasion, and yielded to him in a thrice ploughed fallow field, Zeus came to hear of it before so long and killed Iasion with his thunder-bolts. And now you are angry with me too because I have a man here. I found the poor creature sitting all alone astride of a keel, for Zeus had struck his ship with lightning and sunk it in mid ocean, so that all his crew were drowned, while he himself was driven by wind and waves on to my island. I got fond of him and cherished him, and had set my heart on making him immortal, so that he should never grow old all his days; still I cannot cross Zeus, nor bring his counsels   to nothing; therefore, if he insists upon it, let the man go beyond the seas again; but I cannot send him anywhere myself for I have neither ships nor men who can take him. Nevertheless I will readily give him such advice, in all good faith, as will be likely to bring him safely to his own country."""	ὣς φάτο, ῥίγησεν δὲ Καλυψώ, δῖα θεάων, καί μιν φωνήσασʼ ἔπεα πτερόεντα προσηύδα· σχέτλιοί ἐστε, θεοί, ζηλήμονες ἔξοχον ἄλλων, οἵ τε θεαῖς ἀγάασθε παρʼ ἀνδράσιν εὐνάζεσθαι ἀμφαδίην, ἤν τίς τε φίλον ποιήσετʼ ἀκοίτην. ὣς μὲν ὅτʼ Ὠρίωνʼ ἕλετο ῥοδοδάκτυλος Ἠώς, τόφρα οἱ ἠγάασθε θεοὶ ῥεῖα ζώοντες, ἧος ἐν Ὀρτυγίῃ χρυσόθρονος Ἄρτεμις ἁγνὴ οἷς ἀγανοῖς βελέεσσιν ἐποιχομένη κατέπεφνεν. ὣς δʼ ὁπότʼ Ἰασίωνι ἐυπλόκαμος Δημήτηρ, ᾧ θυμῷ εἴξασα, μίγη φιλότητι καὶ εὐνῇ νειῷ ἔνι τριπόλῳ· οὐδὲ δὴν ἦεν ἄπυστος Ζεύς, ὅς μιν κατέπεφνε βαλὼν ἀργῆτι κεραυνῷ. ὥς δʼ αὖ νῦν μοι ἄγασθε, θεοί, βροτὸν ἄνδρα παρεῖναι. τὸν μὲν ἐγὼν ἐσάωσα περὶ τρόπιος βεβαῶτα οἶον, ἐπεί οἱ νῆα θοὴν ἀργῆτι κεραυνῷ Ζεὺς ἔλσας ἐκέασσε μέσῳ ἐνὶ οἴνοπι πόντῳ. ἔνθʼ ἄλλοι μὲν πάντες ἀπέφθιθεν ἐσθλοὶ ἑταῖροι, τὸν δʼ ἄρα δεῦρʼ ἄνεμός τε φέρων καὶ κῦμα πέλασσε. τὸν μὲν ἐγὼ φίλεόν τε καὶ ἔτρεφον, ἠδὲ ἔφασκον θήσειν ἀθάνατον καὶ ἀγήραον ἤματα πάντα. ἀλλʼ ἐπεὶ οὔ πως ἔστι Διὸς νόον αἰγιόχοιο οὔτε παρεξελθεῖν ἄλλον θεὸν οὔθʼ ἁλιῶσαι, ἐρρέτω, εἴ μιν κεῖνος ἐποτρύνει καὶ ἀνώγει, πόντον ἐπʼ ἀτρύγετον· πέμψω δέ μιν οὔ πῃ ἐγώ γε· οὐ γάρ μοι πάρα νῆες ἐπήρετμοι καὶ ἑταῖροι, οἵ κέν μιν πέμποιεν ἐπʼ εὐρέα νῶτα θαλάσσης. αὐτάρ οἱ πρόφρων ὑποθήσομαι, οὐδʼ ἐπικεύσω, ὥς κε μάλʼ ἀσκηθὴς ἣν πατρίδα γαῖαν ἵκηται.
"""Then send him away,"" said Hermes, ""and fear the of Zeus, lest he grow angry and punish you""’"	τὴν δʼ αὖτε προσέειπε διάκτορος ἀργεϊφόντης· οὕτω νῦν ἀπόπεμπε, Διὸς δʼ ἐποπίζεο μῆνιν, μή πώς τοι μετόπισθε κοτεσσάμενος χαλεπήνῃ.
On this he took his leave, and Calypso went out to look for Odysseus, for she had heard Zeus’ message. She found him sitting upon the beach with his eyes ever filled with tears, his sweet life wasting away as he mourned his ; for he had got tired of Calypso, and though he was forced to sleep with her in the cave by night, it was she, not he, that would have it so. As for the daytime, he spent it on the rocks and on the sea-shore, weeping, crying aloud for his despair, and always looking out upon the sea. Calypso then went close up to him said:	ὣς ἄρα φωνήσας ἀπέβη κρατὺς ἀργεϊφόντης· ἡ δʼ ἐπʼ Ὀδυσσῆα μεγαλήτορα πότνια νύμφη ἤιʼ, ἐπεὶ δὴ Ζηνὸς ἐπέκλυεν ἀγγελιάων. τὸν δʼ ἄρʼ ἐπʼ ἀκτῆς εὗρε καθήμενον· οὐδέ ποτʼ ὄσσε δακρυόφιν τέρσοντο, κατείβετο δὲ γλυκὺς αἰὼν νόστον ὀδυρομένῳ, ἐπεὶ οὐκέτι ἥνδανε νύμφη. ἀλλʼ ἦ τοι νύκτας μὲν ἰαύεσκεν καὶ ἀνάγκῃ ἐν σπέσσι γλαφυροῖσι παρʼ οὐκ ἐθέλων ἐθελούσῃ· ἤματα δʼ ἂμ πέτρῃσι καὶ ἠιόνεσσι καθίζων δάκρυσι καὶ στοναχῇσι καὶ ἄλγεσι θυμὸν ἐρέχθων πόντον ἐπʼ ἀτρύγετον δερκέσκετο δάκρυα λείβων. ἀγχοῦ δʼ ἱσταμένη προσεφώνεε δῖα θεάων·
"""My poor man, you shall not stay here grieving and fretting your life out any longer. I am going to send you away of my own free will; so go, cut some beams of wood, and make yourself a large raft with an upper deck that it may carry you safely over the sea. I will put bread, wine, and water on board to save you from starving. I will also give you clothes, and will send you a fair wind to take you home, if the gods in heaven so will it - for they know more about these things, and can settle them better than I can."""	κάμμορε, μή μοι ἔτʼ ἐνθάδʼ ὀδύρεο, μηδέ τοι αἰὼν φθινέτω· ἤδη γάρ σε μάλα πρόφρασσʼ ἀποπέμψω. ἀλλʼ ἄγε δούρατα μακρὰ ταμὼν ἁρμόζεο χαλκῷ εὐρεῖαν σχεδίην· ἀτὰρ ἴκρια πῆξαι ἐπʼ αὐτῆς ὑψοῦ, ὥς σε φέρῃσιν ἐπʼ ἠεροειδέα πόντον. αὐτὰρ ἐγὼ σῖτον καὶ ὕδωρ καὶ οἶνον ἐρυθρὸν ἐνθήσω μενοεικέʼ, ἅ κέν τοι λιμὸν ἐρύκοι, εἵματά τʼ ἀμφιέσω· πέμψω δέ τοι οὖρον ὄπισθεν, ὥς κε μάλʼ ἀσκηθὴς σὴν πατρίδα γαῖαν ἵκηαι, αἴ κε θεοί γʼ ἐθέλωσι, τοὶ οὐρανὸν εὐρὺν ἔχουσιν, οἵ μευ φέρτεροί εἰσι νοῆσαί τε κρῆναί τε.
"Odysseus shuddered as he heard her. ""Now goddess,"" he answered, ""there is something behind all this; you cannot be really meaning to help me home when you bid me do such a dreadful thing as put to sea on a raft. Not even a well-found ship with a fair wind could venture on such a distant voyage: nothing that you can say or do shall make me go on board a raft unless you first solemnly swear that you mean me no mischief."""	ὣς φάτο, ῥίγησεν δὲ πολύτλας δῖος Ὀδυσσεύς, καί μιν φωνήσας ἔπεα πτερόεντα προσηύδα· ἄλλο τι δὴ σύ, θεά, τόδε μήδεαι, οὐδέ τι πομπήν, ἥ με κέλεαι σχεδίῃ περάαν μέγα λαῖτμα θαλάσσης, δεινόν τʼ ἀργαλέον τε· τὸ δʼ οὐδʼ ἐπὶ νῆες ἐῖσαι ὠκύποροι περόωσιν, ἀγαλλόμεναι Διὸς οὔρῳ. οὐδʼ ἂν ἐγὼν ἀέκητι σέθεν σχεδίης ἐπιβαίην, εἰ μή μοι τλαίης γε, θεά, μέγαν ὅρκον ὀμόσσαι μή τί μοι αὐτῷ πῆμα κακὸν βουλευσέμεν ἄλλο.
"Calypso smiled at this and caressed him with her hand: ""You know a great deal,"" said she, ""but you are quite wrong here. May heaven above and earth below be my witnesses, with the waters of the river Styx - and this is the most solemn oath which a blessed god can take - that I mean you no sort of harm, and am only advising you to do exactly what I should do myself in your place. My is favorable towards you; my heart is not made of iron, and I am very sorry for you."""	ὣς φάτο, μείδησεν δὲ Καλυψὼ δῖα θεάων, χειρί τέ μιν κατέρεξεν ἔπος τʼ ἔφατʼ ἔκ τʼ ὀνόμαζεν· ἦ δὴ ἀλιτρός γʼ ἐσσὶ καὶ οὐκ ἀποφώλια εἰδώς, οἷον δὴ τὸν μῦθον ἐπεφράσθης ἀγορεῦσαι. ἴστω νῦν τόδε γαῖα καὶ οὐρανὸς εὐρὺς ὕπερθε καὶ τὸ κατειβόμενον Στυγὸς ὕδωρ, ὅς τε μέγιστος ὅρκος δεινότατός τε πέλει μακάρεσσι θεοῖσι, μή τί τοι αὐτῷ πῆμα κακὸν βουλευσέμεν ἄλλο. ἀλλὰ τὰ μὲν νοέω καὶ φράσσομαι, ἅσσʼ ἂν ἐμοί περ αὐτῇ μηδοίμην, ὅτε με χρειὼ τόσον ἵκοι· καὶ γὰρ ἐμοὶ νόος ἐστὶν ἐναίσιμος, οὐδέ μοι αὐτῇ θυμὸς ἐνὶ στήθεσσι σιδήρεος, ἀλλʼ ἐλεήμων.
When she had thus spoken she led the way rapidly before him, and Odysseus followed in her steps; so the pair, goddess and man, went on and on till they came to Calypso's cave, where Odysseus took the seat that Hermes had just left. Calypso set meat and drink before him of the food that mortals eat; but her maids brought ambrosia and nectar for herself, and they laid their hands on the good things that were before them. When they had satisfied themselves with meat and drink, Calypso spoke, saying:	ὣς ἄρα φωνήσασʼ ἡγήσατο δῖα θεάων καρπαλίμως· ὁ δʼ ἔπειτα μετʼ ἴχνια βαῖνε θεοῖο. ἷξον δὲ σπεῖος γλαφυρὸν θεὸς ἠδὲ καὶ ἀνήρ, καί ῥʼ ὁ μὲν ἔνθα καθέζετʼ ἐπὶ θρόνου ἔνθεν ἀνέστη Ἑρμείας, νύμφη δʼ ἐτίθει πάρα πᾶσαν ἐδωδήν, ἔσθειν καὶ πίνειν, οἷα βροτοὶ ἄνδρες ἔδουσιν· αὐτὴ δʼ ἀντίον ἷζεν Ὀδυσσῆος θείοιο, τῇ δὲ παρʼ ἀμβροσίην δμῳαὶ καὶ νέκταρ ἔθηκαν. οἱ δʼ ἐπʼ ὀνείαθʼ ἑτοῖμα προκείμενα χεῖρας ἴαλλον. αὐτὰρ ἐπεὶ τάρπησαν ἐδητύος ἠδὲ ποτῆτος, τοῖς ἄρα μύθων ἦρχε Καλυψώ, δῖα θεάων·
"""Odysseus, noble son of Laertes , so you would start home to your own land at once? Good luck go with you, but if you could only know how much suffering is in store for you before you get back to your own country, you would stay where you are, keep house along with me, and let me make you immortal, no matter how anxious you may be to see this wife of yours, of whom you are thinking all the time, day after day; yet I flatter myself that I am no whit less tall or well-looking than she is, for it is not to be expected that a mortal woman should compare in beauty with an immortal."""	διογενὲς Λαερτιάδη, πολυμήχανʼ Ὀδυσσεῦ, οὕτω δὴ οἶκόνδε φίλην ἐς πατρίδα γαῖαν αὐτίκα νῦν ἐθέλεις ἰέναι; σὺ δὲ χαῖρε καὶ ἔμπης. εἴ γε μὲν εἰδείης σῇσι φρεσὶν ὅσσα τοι αἶσα κήδεʼ ἀναπλῆσαι, πρὶν πατρίδα γαῖαν ἱκέσθαι, ἐνθάδε κʼ αὖθι μένων σὺν ἐμοὶ τόδε δῶμα φυλάσσοις ἀθάνατός τʼ εἴης, ἱμειρόμενός περ ἰδέσθαι σὴν ἄλοχον, τῆς τʼ αἰὲν ἐέλδεαι ἤματα πάντα. οὐ μέν θην κείνης γε χερείων εὔχομαι εἶναι, οὐ δέμας οὐδὲ φυήν, ἐπεὶ οὔ πως οὐδὲ ἔοικεν θνητὰς ἀθανάτῃσι δέμας καὶ εἶδος ἐρίζειν.
"""Goddess,"" replied Odysseus, ""do not be angry with me about this. I am quite aware that my wife Penelope is nothing like so tall or so beautiful as yourself. She is only a woman, whereas you are an immortal. Nevertheless, I want to get home, and can think of nothing else. If some god wrecks me when I am on the sea, I will bear it and make the best of it. I have had infinite trouble both by land and sea already, so let this go with the rest."""	τὴν δʼ ἀπαμειβόμενος προσέφη πολύμητις Ὀδυσσεύς· πότνα θεά, μή μοι τόδε χώεο· οἶδα καὶ αὐτὸς πάντα μάλʼ, οὕνεκα σεῖο περίφρων Πηνελόπεια εἶδος ἀκιδνοτέρη μέγεθός τʼ εἰσάντα ἰδέσθαι· ἡ μὲν γὰρ βροτός ἐστι, σὺ δʼ ἀθάνατος καὶ ἀγήρως. ἀλλὰ καὶ ὣς ἐθέλω καὶ ἐέλδομαι ἤματα πάντα οἴκαδέ τʼ ἐλθέμεναι καὶ νόστιμον ἦμαρ ἰδέσθαι. εἰ δʼ αὖ τις ῥαίῃσι θεῶν ἐνὶ οἴνοπι πόντῳ, τλήσομαι ἐν στήθεσσιν ἔχων ταλαπενθέα θυμόν· ἤδη γὰρ μάλα πολλὰ πάθον καὶ πολλὰ μόγησα κύμασι καὶ πολέμῳ· μετὰ καὶ τόδε τοῖσι γενέσθω.
Presently the sun set and it became dark, whereon the pair retired into the inner part of the cave and went to bed.	ὣς ἔφατʼ, ἠέλιος δʼ ἄρʼ ἔδυ καὶ ἐπὶ κνέφας ἦλθεν· ἐλθόντες δʼ ἄρα τώ γε μυχῷ σπείους γλαφυροῖο τερπέσθην φιλότητι, παρʼ ἀλλήλοισι μένοντες.
When the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared, Odysseus put on his shirt and cloak, while the goddess wore a dress of a light gossamer fabric, very fine and graceful, with a beautiful golden girdle about her waist and a veil to cover her head. She at once set herself to think how she could speed Odysseus on his way. So she gave him a great bronze axe that suited his hands; it was sharpened on both sides, and had a beautiful olive-wood handle fitted firmly on to it. She also gave him a sharp adze, and then led the way to the far end of the island where the largest trees grew - alder, poplar and pine, that reached the sky - very dry and well seasoned, so as to sail light for him in the water. Then, when she had shown him where the best trees grew, Calypso went home, leaving him to cut them, which he soon finished doing. He cut down twenty trees in all and adzed them smooth, squaring them by rule in good workmanlike fashion. Meanwhile Calypso came back with some augers, so he bored holes with them and fitted the timbers together with bolts and rivets. He made the raft as broad as a skilled shipwright makes the beam of a large vessel, and he filed a deck on top of the ribs, and ran a gunwale all round it. He also made a mast with a yard arm, and a rudder to steer with. He fenced the raft all round with wicker hurdles as a protection against the waves, and then he threw on a quantity of wood. By and by Calypso brought him some linen to make the sails, and he made these too, excellently, making them fast with braces and sheets. Last of all, with the help of levers, he drew the raft down into the water.	ἦμος δʼ ἠριγένεια φάνη ῥοδοδάκτυλος Ἠώς, αὐτίχʼ ὁ μὲν χλαῖνάν τε χιτῶνά τε ἕννυτʼ Ὀδυσσεύς, αὐτὴ δʼ ἀργύφεον φᾶρος μέγα ἕννυτο νύμφη, λεπτὸν καὶ χαρίεν, περὶ δὲ ζώνην βάλετʼ ἰξυῖ καλὴν χρυσείην, κεφαλῇ δʼ ἐφύπερθε καλύπτρην. καὶ τότʼ Ὀδυσσῆι μεγαλήτορι μήδετο πομπήν· δῶκέν οἱ πέλεκυν μέγαν, ἄρμενον ἐν παλάμῃσι, χάλκεον, ἀμφοτέρωθεν ἀκαχμένον· αὐτὰρ ἐν αὐτῷ στειλειὸν περικαλλὲς ἐλάινον, εὖ ἐναρηρός· δῶκε δʼ ἔπειτα σκέπαρνον ἐύξοον· ἦρχε δʼ ὁδοῖο νήσου ἐπʼ ἐσχατιῆς, ὅθι δένδρεα μακρὰ πεφύκει, κλήθρη τʼ αἴγειρός τʼ, ἐλάτη τʼ ἦν οὐρανομήκης, αὖα πάλαι, περίκηλα, τά οἱ πλώοιεν ἐλαφρῶς. αὐτὰρ ἐπεὶ δὴ δεῖξʼ, ὅθι δένδρεα μακρὰ πεφύκει, ἡ μὲν ἔβη πρὸς δῶμα Καλυψώ, δῖα θεάων, αὐτὰρ ὁ τάμνετο δοῦρα· θοῶς δέ οἱ ἤνυτο ἔργον. εἴκοσι δʼ ἔκβαλε πάντα, πελέκκησεν δʼ ἄρα χαλκῷ, ξέσσε δʼ ἐπισταμένως καὶ ἐπὶ στάθμην ἴθυνεν. τόφρα δʼ ἔνεικε τέρετρα Καλυψώ, δῖα θεάων· τέτρηνεν δʼ ἄρα πάντα καὶ ἥρμοσεν ἀλλήλοισιν, γόμφοισιν δʼ ἄρα τήν γε καὶ ἁρμονίῃσιν ἄρασσεν. ὅσσον τίς τʼ ἔδαφος νηὸς τορνώσεται ἀνὴρ φορτίδος εὐρείης, ἐὺ εἰδὼς τεκτοσυνάων, τόσσον ἔπʼ εὐρεῖαν σχεδίην ποιήσατʼ Ὀδυσσεύς. ἴκρια δὲ στήσας, ἀραρὼν θαμέσι σταμίνεσσι, ποίει· ἀτὰρ μακρῇσιν ἐπηγκενίδεσσι τελεύτα. ἐν δʼ ἱστὸν ποίει καὶ ἐπίκριον ἄρμενον αὐτῷ· πρὸς δʼ ἄρα πηδάλιον ποιήσατο, ὄφρʼ ἰθύνοι. φράξε δέ μιν ῥίπεσσι διαμπερὲς οἰσυΐνῃσι κύματος εἶλαρ ἔμεν· πολλὴν δʼ ἐπεχεύατο ὕλην. τόφρα δὲ φάρεʼ ἔνεικε Καλυψώ, δῖα θεάων, ἱστία ποιήσασθαι· ὁ δʼ εὖ τεχνήσατο καὶ τά. ἐν δʼ ὑπέρας τε κάλους τε πόδας τʼ ἐνέδησεν ἐν αὐτῇ, μοχλοῖσιν δʼ ἄρα τήν γε κατείρυσεν εἰς ἅλα δῖαν.
In four days he had completed the whole work, and on the fifth Calypso sent him from the island after washing him and giving him some clean clothes. She gave him a goat skin full of black wine, and another larger one of water; she also gave him a wallet full of provisions, and found him in much good meat. Moreover, she made the wind fair and warm for him, and gladly did Odysseus spread his sail before it, while he sat and guided the raft skillfully by means of the rudder. He never closed his eyes, but kept them fixed on the Pleiads, on late-setting Boötes, and on the Bear - which men also call the Wain, and which turns round and round where it is, facing Orion, and alone never dipping into the stream of Okeanos - for Calypso had told him to keep this to his left. Seventeen days did he sail over the sea, and on the eighteenth the dim outlines of the mountains on the nearest part of the Phaeacian coast appeared, rising like a shield on the horizon.	τέτρατον ἦμαρ ἔην, καὶ τῷ τετέλεστο ἅπαντα· τῷ δʼ ἄρα πέμπτῳ πέμπʼ ἀπὸ νήσου δῖα Καλυψώ, εἵματά τʼ ἀμφιέσασα θυώδεα καὶ λούσασα. ἐν δέ οἱ ἀσκὸν ἔθηκε θεὰ μέλανος οἴνοιο τὸν ἕτερον, ἕτερον δʼ ὕδατος μέγαν, ἐν δὲ καὶ ᾖα κωρύκῳ· ἐν δέ οἱ ὄψα τίθει μενοεικέα πολλά· οὖρον δὲ προέηκεν ἀπήμονά τε λιαρόν τε. γηθόσυνος δʼ οὔρῳ πέτασʼ ἱστία δῖος Ὀδυσσεύς. αὐτὰρ ὁ πηδαλίῳ ἰθύνετο τεχνηέντως ἥμενος, οὐδέ οἱ ὕπνος ἐπὶ βλεφάροισιν ἔπιπτεν Πληιάδας τʼ ἐσορῶντι καὶ ὀψὲ δύοντα Βοώτην Ἄρκτον θʼ, ἣν καὶ ἄμαξαν ἐπίκλησιν καλέουσιν, ἥ τʼ αὐτοῦ στρέφεται καί τʼ Ὠρίωνα δοκεύει, οἴη δʼ ἄμμορός ἐστι λοετρῶν Ὠκεανοῖο· τὴν γὰρ δή μιν ἄνωγε Καλυψώ, δῖα θεάων, ποντοπορευέμεναι ἐπʼ ἀριστερὰ χειρὸς ἔχοντα. ἑπτὰ δὲ καὶ δέκα μὲν πλέεν ἤματα ποντοπορεύων, ὀκτωκαιδεκάτῃ δʼ ἐφάνη ὄρεα σκιόεντα γαίης Φαιήκων, ὅθι τʼ ἄγχιστον πέλεν αὐτῷ· εἴσατο δʼ ὡς ὅτε ῥινὸν ἐν ἠεροειδέι πόντῳ.
"But lord Poseidon, who was returning from the Ethiopians, caught sight of Odysseus a long way off, from the mountains of the Solymi. He could see him sailing upon the sea, and it made him very angry, so he wagged his head and muttered to himself, saying, heavens, so the gods have been changing their minds about Odysseus while I was away in Ethiopia , and now he is close to the land of the Phaeacians, where it is decreed that he shall escape from the calamities that have befallen him. Still, he shall have plenty of hardship yet before he has done with it."""	τὸν δʼ ἐξ Αἰθιόπων ἀνιὼν κρείων ἐνοσίχθων τηλόθεν ἐκ Σολύμων ὀρέων ἴδεν· εἴσατο γάρ οἱ πόντον ἐπιπλώων. ὁ δʼ ἐχώσατο κηρόθι μᾶλλον, κινήσας δὲ κάρη προτὶ ὃν μυθήσατο θυμόν· ὢ πόποι, ἦ μάλα δὴ μετεβούλευσαν θεοὶ ἄλλως ἀμφʼ Ὀδυσῆι ἐμεῖο μετʼ Αἰθιόπεσσιν ἐόντος, καὶ δὴ Φαιήκων γαίης σχεδόν, ἔνθα οἱ αἶσα ἐκφυγέειν μέγα πεῖραρ ὀιζύος, ἥ μιν ἱκάνει. ἀλλʼ ἔτι μέν μίν φημι ἅδην ἐλάαν κακότητος.
"Thereon he gathered his clouds together, grasped his trident, stirred it round in the sea, and roused the rage of every wind that blows till earth, sea, and sky were hidden in cloud, and night sprang forth out of the heavens. Winds from East, South, North, and West fell upon him all at the same time, and a tremendous sea got up, so that Odysseus’ heart began to fail him. ""Alas,"" he said to himself in his dismay, ""what ever will become of me? I am afraid Calypso was right when she said I should have trouble by sea before I got back home. It is all coming true. How black is Zeus making heaven with his clouds, and what a sea the winds are raising from every quarter at once. I am now safe to perish. Blest and thrice blest were those Danaans who fell before Troy in the cause of   the sons of Atreus. Would that had been killed on the day when the Trojans were pressing me so sorely about the dead body of Achilles, for then I should have had due burial and the Achaeans would have honored my name  ; but now it seems that I shall come to a most pitiable end."""	ὣς εἰπὼν σύναγεν νεφέλας, ἐτάραξε δὲ πόντον χερσὶ τρίαιναν ἑλών· πάσας δʼ ὀρόθυνεν ἀέλλας παντοίων ἀνέμων, σὺν δὲ νεφέεσσι κάλυψε γαῖαν ὁμοῦ καὶ πόντον· ὀρώρει δʼ οὐρανόθεν νύξ. σὺν δʼ Εὖρός τε Νότος τʼ ἔπεσον Ζέφυρός τε δυσαὴς καὶ Βορέης αἰθρηγενέτης, μέγα κῦμα κυλίνδων. καὶ τότʼ Ὀδυσσῆος λύτο γούνατα καὶ φίλον ἦτορ, ὀχθήσας δʼ ἄρα εἶπε πρὸς ὃν μεγαλήτορα θυμόν· ὤ μοι ἐγὼ δειλός, τί νύ μοι μήκιστα γένηται; δείδω μὴ δὴ πάντα θεὰ νημερτέα εἶπεν, ἥ μʼ ἔφατʼ ἐν πόντῳ, πρὶν πατρίδα γαῖαν ἱκέσθαι, ἄλγεʼ ἀναπλήσειν· τὰ δὲ δὴ νῦν πάντα τελεῖται. οἵοισιν νεφέεσσι περιστέφει οὐρανὸν εὐρὺν Ζεύς, ἐτάραξε δὲ πόντον, ἐπισπέρχουσι δʼ ἄελλαι παντοίων ἀνέμων. νῦν μοι σῶς αἰπὺς ὄλεθρος. τρὶς μάκαρες Δαναοὶ καὶ τετράκις, οἳ τότʼ ὄλοντο Τροίῃ ἐν εὐρείῃ χάριν Ἀτρεΐδῃσι φέροντες. ὡς δὴ ἐγώ γʼ ὄφελον θανέειν καὶ πότμον ἐπισπεῖν ἤματι τῷ ὅτε μοι πλεῖστοι χαλκήρεα δοῦρα Τρῶες ἐπέρριψαν περὶ Πηλεΐωνι θανόντι. τῷ κʼ ἔλαχον κτερέων, καί μευ κλέος ἦγον Ἀχαιοί· νῦν δέ λευγαλέῳ θανάτῳ εἵμαρτο ἁλῶναι.
As he spoke a sea broke over him with such terrific fury that the raft reeled again, and he was carried overboard a long way off. He let go the helm, and the force of the wind was so great that it broke the mast half way up, and both sail and yard went over into the sea. For a long time Odysseus was under water, and it was all he could do to rise to the surface again, for the clothes Calypso had given him weighed him down; but at last he got his head above water and spat out the bitter brine that was running down his face in streams. In spite of all this, however, he did not lose sight of his raft, but swam as fast as he could towards it, got hold of it, and climbed on board again so as to escape drowning. The sea took the raft and tossed it about as Autumn winds whirl thistledown round and round upon a road. (It was as though the South, North, East, and West winds were all at once tossing it back and forth.)	ὣς ἄρα μιν εἰπόντʼ ἔλασεν μέγα κῦμα κατʼ ἄκρης δεινὸν ἐπεσσύμενον, περὶ δὲ σχεδίην ἐλέλιξε. τῆλε δʼ ἀπὸ σχεδίης αὐτὸς πέσε, πηδάλιον δὲ ἐκ χειρῶν προέηκε· μέσον δέ οἱ ἱστὸν ἔαξεν δεινὴ μισγομένων ἀνέμων ἐλθοῦσα θύελλα, τηλοῦ δὲ σπεῖρον καὶ ἐπίκριον ἔμπεσε πόντῳ. τὸν δʼ ἄρʼ ὑπόβρυχα θῆκε πολὺν χρόνον, οὐδʼ ἐδυνάσθη αἶψα μάλʼ ἀνσχεθέειν μεγάλου ὑπὸ κύματος ὁρμῆς· εἵματα γάρ ῥʼ ἐβάρυνε, τά οἱ πόρε δῖα Καλυψώ. ὀψὲ δὲ δή ῥʼ ἀνέδυ, στόματος δʼ ἐξέπτυσεν ἅλμην πικρήν, ἥ οἱ πολλὴ ἀπὸ κρατὸς κελάρυζεν. ἀλλʼ οὐδʼ ὣς σχεδίης ἐπελήθετο, τειρόμενός περ, ἀλλὰ μεθορμηθεὶς ἐνὶ κύμασιν ἐλλάβετʼ αὐτῆς, ἐν μέσσῃ δὲ καθῖζε τέλος θανάτου ἀλεείνων. τὴν δʼ ἐφόρει μέγα κῦμα κατὰ ῥόον ἔνθα καὶ ἔνθα. ὡς δʼ ὅτʼ ὀπωρινὸς Βορέης φορέῃσιν ἀκάνθας ἂμ πεδίον, πυκιναὶ δὲ πρὸς ἀλλήλῃσιν ἔχονται, ὣς τὴν ἂμ πέλαγος ἄνεμοι φέρον ἔνθα καὶ ἔνθα· ἄλλοτε μέν τε Νότος Βορέῃ προβάλεσκε φέρεσθαι, ἄλλοτε δʼ αὖτʼ Εὖρος Ζεφύρῳ εἴξασκε διώκειν.
When he was in this plight, Ino daughter of Cadmus, also called Leukothea, saw him. She had formerly been a mere mortal, but had been since raised to the rank of a marine goddess. Seeing in what great distress Odysseus now was, she had compassion upon him, and, rising like a sea-gull from the waves, took her seat upon the raft.	τὸν δὲ ἴδεν Κάδμου θυγάτηρ, καλλίσφυρος Ἰνώ, Λευκοθέη, ἣ πρὶν μὲν ἔην βροτὸς αὐδήεσσα, νῦν δʼ ἁλὸς ἐν πελάγεσσι θεῶν ἒξ ἔμμορε τιμῆς. ἥ ῥʼ Ὀδυσῆʼ ἐλέησεν ἀλώμενον, ἄλγεʼ ἔχοντα, αἰθυίῃ δʼ ἐικυῖα ποτῇ ἀνεδύσετο λίμνης, ἷζε δʼ ἐπὶ σχεδίης πολυδέσμου εἶπέ τε μῦθον·
"""My poor good man,"" said she, ""why is Poseidon so furiously angry with you? He is giving you a great deal of trouble, but for all his bluster he will not kill you. You seem to be a sensible person, do then as I bid you; strip, leave your raft to drive before the wind, and swim to the Phaeacian coast where better luck awaits you. And here, take my veil and put it round your chest; it is enchanted, and you can come to no harm so long as you wear it. As soon as you touch land take it off, throw it back as far as you can into the sea, and then go away again."" With these words she took off her veil and gave it him. Then she dived down again like a sea-gull and vanished beneath the seething dark waters."	κάμμορε, τίπτε τοι ὧδε Ποσειδάων ἐνοσίχθων ὠδύσατʼ ἐκπάγλως, ὅτι τοι κακὰ πολλὰ φυτεύει; οὐ μὲν δή σε καταφθίσει μάλα περ μενεαίνων. ἀλλὰ μάλʼ ὧδʼ ἔρξαι, δοκέεις δέ μοι οὐκ ἀπινύσσειν· εἵματα ταῦτʼ ἀποδὺς σχεδίην ἀνέμοισι φέρεσθαι κάλλιπʼ, ἀτὰρ χείρεσσι νέων ἐπιμαίεο νόστου γαίης Φαιήκων, ὅθι τοι μοῖρʼ ἐστὶν ἀλύξαι. τῆ δέ, τόδε κρήδεμνον ὑπὸ στέρνοιο τανύσσαι ἄμβροτον· οὐδέ τί τοι παθέειν δέος οὐδʼ ἀπολέσθαι. αὐτὰρ ἐπὴν χείρεσσιν ἐφάψεαι ἠπείροιο, ἂψ ἀπολυσάμενος βαλέειν εἰς οἴνοπα πόντον πολλὸν ἀπʼ ἠπείρου, αὐτὸς δʼ ἀπονόσφι τραπέσθαι. ὣς ἄρα φωνήσασα θεὰ κρήδεμνον ἔδωκεν, αὐτὴ δʼ ἂψ ἐς πόντον ἐδύσετο κυμαίνοντα αἰθυίῃ ἐικυῖα· μέλαν δέ ἑ κῦμα κάλυψεν.
"But Odysseus did not know what to think. ""Alas,"" he said to himself in his dismay, ""this is only some one or other of the gods who is luring me to ruin by advising me to will quit my raft. At any rate I will not do so at present, for the land where she said I should be quit of all troubles seemed to be still a good way off. I know what I will do - I am sure it will be best - no matter what happens I will stick to the raft as long as her timbers hold together, but when the sea breaks her up I will swim for it; I do not see how I can do any better than this."""	αὐτὰρ ὁ μερμήριξε πολύτλας δῖος Ὀδυσσεύς, ὀχθήσας δʼ ἄρα εἶπε πρὸς ὃν μεγαλήτορα θυμόν· ὤ μοι ἐγώ, μή τίς μοι ὑφαίνῃσιν δόλον αὖτε ἀθανάτων, ὅ τέ με σχεδίης ἀποβῆναι ἀνώγει. ἀλλὰ μάλʼ οὔ πω πείσομʼ, ἐπεὶ ἑκὰς ὀφθαλμοῖσιν γαῖαν ἐγὼν ἰδόμην, ὅθι μοι φάτο φύξιμον εἶναι. ἀλλὰ μάλʼ ὧδʼ ἔρξω, δοκέει δέ μοι εἶναι ἄριστον· ὄφρʼ ἂν μέν κεν δούρατʼ ἐν ἁρμονίῃσιν ἀρήρῃ, τόφρʼ αὐτοῦ μενέω καὶ τλήσομαι ἄλγεα πάσχων· αὐτὰρ ἐπὴν δή μοι σχεδίην διὰ κῦμα τινάξῃ, νήξομʼ, ἐπεὶ οὐ μέν τι πάρα προνοῆσαι ἄμεινον.
"While he was thus in two minds, Poseidon sent a terrible great wave that seemed to rear itself above his head till it broke right over the raft, which then went to pieces as though it were a heap of dry chaff tossed about by a whirlwind. Odysseus got astride of one plank and rode upon it as if he were on horseback; he then took off the clothes Calypso had given him, bound Ino's veil under his arms, and plunged into the sea - meaning to swim on shore. King Poseidon watched him as he did so, and wagged his head, muttering to himself and saying, ""‘There now, swim up and down as you best can till you fall in with well-to-do people. I do not think you will be able to say that I have let you off too lightly."" On this he lashed his horses and drove to Aigai where his palace is."	ἧος ὁ ταῦθʼ ὥρμαινε κατὰ φρένα καὶ κατὰ θυμόν, ὦρσε δʼ ἐπὶ μέγα κῦμα Ποσειδάων ἐνοσίχθων, δεινόν τʼ ἀργαλέον τε, κατηρεφές, ἤλασε δʼ αὐτόν. ὡς δʼ ἄνεμος ζαὴς ἠΐων θημῶνα τινάξῃ καρφαλέων· τὰ μὲν ἄρ τε διεσκέδασʼ ἄλλυδις ἄλλῃ· ὣς τῆς δούρατα μακρὰ διεσκέδασʼ. αὐτὰρ Ὀδυσσεὺς ἀμφʼ ἑνὶ δούρατι βαῖνε, κέληθʼ ὡς ἵππον ἐλαύνων, εἵματα δʼ ἐξαπέδυνε, τά οἱ πόρε δῖα Καλυψώ. αὐτίκα δὲ κρήδεμνον ὑπὸ στέρνοιο τάνυσσεν, αὐτὸς δὲ πρηνὴς ἁλὶ κάππεσε, χεῖρε πετάσσας, νηχέμεναι μεμαώς. ἴδε δὲ κρείων ἐνοσίχθων, κινήσας δὲ κάρη προτὶ ὃν μυθήσατο θυμόν· οὕτω νῦν κακὰ πολλὰ παθὼν ἀλόω κατὰ πόντον, εἰς ὅ κεν ἀνθρώποισι διοτρεφέεσσι μιγήῃς. ἀλλʼ οὐδʼ ὥς σε ἔολπα ὀνόσσεσθαι κακότητος. ὣς ἄρα φωνήσας ἵμασεν καλλίτριχας ἵππους, ἵκετο δʼ εἰς Αἰγάς, ὅθι οἱ κλυτὰ δώματʼ ἔασιν.
But Athena resolved to help Odysseus, so she bound the ways of all the winds except one, and made them lie quite still; but she roused a good stiff breeze from the North that should lay the waters till Odysseus reached the land of the Phaeacians where he would be safe.	αὐτὰρ Ἀθηναίη κούρη Διὸς ἄλλʼ ἐνόησεν. ἦ τοι τῶν ἄλλων ἀνέμων κατέδησε κελεύθους, παύσασθαι δʼ ἐκέλευσε καὶ εὐνηθῆναι ἅπαντας· ὦρσε δʼ ἐπὶ κραιπνὸν Βορέην, πρὸ δὲ κύματʼ ἔαξεν, ἧος ὃ Φαιήκεσσι φιληρέτμοισι μιγείη διογενὴς Ὀδυσεὺς θάνατον καὶ κῆρας ἀλύξας.
Thereon he floated about for two nights and two days in the water, with a heavy swell on the sea and death staring him in the face; but when the third day broke, the wind fell and there was a dead calm without so much as a breath of air stirring. As he rose on the swell he looked eagerly ahead, and could see land quite near. Then, as children rejoice when their dear father begins to get better after having for a long time borne sore affliction sent him by some angry spirit, but the gods deliver him from evil, so was Odysseus thankful when he again saw land and trees, and swam on with all his strength that he might once more set foot upon dry ground. When, however, he got within earshot, he began to hear the surf thundering up against the rocks, for the swell still broke against them with a terrific roar. Everything was enveloped in spray; there were no harbors where a ship might ride, nor shelter of any kind, but only headlands, low-lying rocks, and mountain tops.	ἔνθα δύω νύκτας δύο τʼ ἤματα κύματι πηγῷ πλάζετο, πολλὰ δέ οἱ κραδίη προτιόσσετʼ ὄλεθρον. ἀλλʼ ὅτε δὴ τρίτον ἦμαρ ἐυπλόκαμος τέλεσʼ Ἠώς, καὶ τότʼ ἔπειτʼ ἄνεμος μὲν ἐπαύσατο ἠδὲ γαλήνη ἔπλετο νηνεμίη· ὁ δʼ ἄρα σχεδὸν εἴσιδε γαῖαν ὀξὺ μάλα προϊδών, μεγάλου ὑπὸ κύματος ἀρθείς. ὡς δʼ ὅτʼ ἂν ἀσπάσιος βίοτος παίδεσσι φανήῃ πατρός, ὃς ἐν νούσῳ κεῖται κρατέρʼ ἄλγεα πάσχων, δηρὸν τηκόμενος, στυγερὸς δέ οἱ ἔχραε δαίμων, ἀσπάσιον δʼ ἄρα τόν γε θεοὶ κακότητος ἔλυσαν, ὣς Ὀδυσεῖ ἀσπαστὸν ἐείσατο γαῖα καὶ ὕλη, νῆχε δʼ ἐπειγόμενος ποσὶν ἠπείρου ἐπιβῆναι. ἀλλʼ ὅτε τόσσον ἀπῆν ὅσσον τε γέγωνε βοήσας, καὶ δὴ δοῦπον ἄκουσε ποτὶ σπιλάδεσσι θαλάσσης· ῥόχθει γὰρ μέγα κῦμα ποτὶ ξερὸν ἠπείροιο δεινὸν ἐρευγόμενον, εἴλυτο δὲ πάνθʼ ἁλὸς ἄχνῃ· οὐ γὰρ ἔσαν λιμένες νηῶν ὄχοι, οὐδʼ ἐπιωγαί. ἀλλʼ ἀκταὶ προβλῆτες ἔσαν σπιλάδες τε πάγοι τε·
"Odysseus’ heart now began to fail him, and he said despairingly to himself, ""Alas, Zeus has let me see land after swimming so far that I had given up all hope, but I can find no landing place, for the coast is rocky and surf-beaten, the rocks are smooth and rise sheer from the sea, with deep water close under them so that I cannot climb out for want of foothold. I am afraid some great wave will lift me off my legs and dash me against the rocks as I leave the water - which would give me a sorry landing. If, on the other hand, I swim further in search of some shelving beach or harbor, a wind may carry me out to sea again sorely against my will, or heaven may send some great monster of the deep to attack me; for Amphitrite breeds many such, and I know that Poseidon is very angry with me."""	καὶ τότʼ Ὀδυσσῆος λύτο γούνατα καὶ φίλον ἦτορ, ὀχθήσας δʼ ἄρα εἶπε πρὸς ὃν μεγαλήτορα θυμόν· ὤ μοι, ἐπεὶ δὴ γαῖαν ἀελπέα δῶκεν ἰδέσθαι Ζεύς, καὶ δὴ τόδε λαῖτμα διατμήξας ἐπέρησα, ἔκβασις οὔ πῃ φαίνεθʼ ἁλὸς πολιοῖο θύραζε· ἔκτοσθεν μὲν γὰρ πάγοι ὀξέες, ἀμφὶ δὲ κῦμα βέβρυχεν ῥόθιον, λισσὴ δʼ ἀναδέδρομε πέτρη, ἀγχιβαθὴς δὲ θάλασσα, καὶ οὔ πως ἔστι πόδεσσι στήμεναι ἀμφοτέροισι καὶ ἐκφυγέειν κακότητα· μή πώς μʼ ἐκβαίνοντα βάλῃ λίθακι ποτὶ πέτρῃ κῦμα μέγʼ ἁρπάξαν· μελέη δέ μοι ἔσσεται ὁρμή. εἰ δέ κʼ ἔτι προτέρω παρανήξομαι, ἤν που ἐφεύρω ἠιόνας τε παραπλῆγας λιμένας τε θαλάσσης, δείδω μή μʼ ἐξαῦτις ἀναρπάξασα θύελλα πόντον ἐπʼ ἰχθυόεντα φέρῃ βαρέα στενάχοντα, ἠέ τί μοι καὶ κῆτος ἐπισσεύῃ μέγα δαίμων ἐξ ἁλός, οἷά τε πολλὰ τρέφει κλυτὸς Ἀμφιτρίτη· οἶδα γάρ, ὥς μοι ὀδώδυσται κλυτὸς ἐννοσίγαιος.
While he was thus in two minds a wave caught him and took him with such force against the rocks that he would have been smashed and torn to pieces if Athena had not shown him what to do. He caught hold of the rock with both hands and clung to it groaning with pain till the wave retired, so he was saved that time; but presently the wave came on again and carried him back with it far into the sea- tearing his hands as the suckers of a octopus are torn when some one plucks it from its bed, and the stones come up along with it- even so did the rocks tear the skin from his strong hands, and then the wave drew him deep down under the water.	ἧος ὁ ταῦθʼ ὥρμαινε κατὰ φρένα καὶ κατὰ θυμόν, τόφρα δέ μιν μέγα κῦμα φέρε τρηχεῖαν ἐπʼ ἀκτήν. ἔνθα κʼ ἀπὸ ῥινοὺς δρύφθη, σὺν δʼ ὀστέʼ ἀράχθη, εἰ μὴ ἐπὶ φρεσὶ θῆκε θεά, γλαυκῶπις Ἀθήνη· ἀμφοτέρῃσι δὲ χερσὶν ἐπεσσύμενος λάβε πέτρης, τῆς ἔχετο στενάχων, ἧος μέγα κῦμα παρῆλθε. καὶ τὸ μὲν ὣς ὑπάλυξε, παλιρρόθιον δέ μιν αὖτις πλῆξεν ἐπεσσύμενον, τηλοῦ δέ μιν ἔμβαλε πόντῳ. ὡς δʼ ὅτε πουλύποδος θαλάμης ἐξελκομένοιο πρὸς κοτυληδονόφιν πυκιναὶ λάιγγες ἔχονται, ὣς τοῦ πρὸς πέτρῃσι θρασειάων ἀπὸ χειρῶν ῥινοὶ ἀπέδρυφθεν· τὸν δὲ μέγα κῦμα κάλυψεν.
Here poor Odysseus would have certainly perished even in spite of his own destiny, if Athena had not helped him to keep his wits about him. He swam seaward again, beyond reach of the surf that was beating against the land, and at the same time he kept looking towards the shore to see if he could find some haven, or a spit that should take the waves aslant. By and by, as he swam on, he came to the mouth of a river, and here he thought would be the best place, for there were no rocks, and it afforded shelter from the wind. He felt that there was a current, so he prayed inwardly and said:	ἔνθα κε δὴ δύστηνος ὑπὲρ μόρον ὤλετʼ Ὀδυσσεύς, εἰ μὴ ἐπιφροσύνην δῶκε γλαυκῶπις Ἀθήνη. κύματος ἐξαναδύς, τά τʼ ἐρεύγεται ἤπειρόνδε, νῆχε παρέξ, ἐς γαῖαν ὁρώμενος, εἴ που ἐφεύροι ἠιόνας τε παραπλῆγας λιμένας τε θαλάσσης. ἀλλʼ ὅτε δὴ ποταμοῖο κατὰ στόμα καλλιρόοιο ἷξε νέων, τῇ δή οἱ ἐείσατο χῶρος ἄριστος, λεῖος πετράων, καὶ ἐπὶ σκέπας ἦν ἀνέμοιο, ἔγνω δὲ προρέοντα καὶ εὔξατο ὃν κατὰ θυμόν·
"""Hear me, O King, whoever you may be, and save me from the anger of the sea-god Poseidon, for I approach you prayerfully. Anyone who has lost his way has at all times a claim even upon the gods, wherefore in my distress I draw near to your stream, and cling to the knees of your riverhood. Have mercy upon me, O king, for I declare myself your suppliant."""	κλῦθι, ἄναξ, ὅτις ἐσσί· πολύλλιστον δέ σʼ ἱκάνω, φεύγων ἐκ πόντοιο Ποσειδάωνος ἐνιπάς. αἰδοῖος μέν τʼ ἐστὶ καὶ ἀθανάτοισι θεοῖσιν ἀνδρῶν ὅς τις ἵκηται ἀλώμενος, ὡς καὶ ἐγὼ νῦν σόν τε ῥόον σά τε γούναθʼ ἱκάνω πολλὰ μογήσας. ἀλλʼ ἐλέαιρε, ἄναξ· ἱκέτης δέ τοι εὔχομαι εἶναι.
Then the god stayed his stream and stilled the waves, making all calm before him, and bringing him safely into the mouth of the river. Here at last Odysseus’ knees and strong hands failed him, for the sea had completely broken him. His body was all swollen, and his mouth and nostrils ran down like a river with sea-water, so that he could neither breathe nor speak, and lay swooning from sheer exhaustion; presently, when he had got his breath and came to himself again, he took off the scarf that Ino had given him and threw it back into the salt stream of the river, whereon Ino received it into her hands from the wave that bore it towards her. Then he left the river, laid himself down among the rushes, and kissed the bounteous earth.	ὣς φάθʼ, ὁ δʼ αὐτίκα παῦσεν ἑὸν ῥόον, ἔσχε δὲ κῦμα, πρόσθε δέ οἱ ποίησε γαλήνην, τὸν δʼ ἐσάωσεν ἐς ποταμοῦ προχοάς. ὁ δʼ ἄρʼ ἄμφω γούνατʼ ἔκαμψε χεῖράς τε στιβαράς. ἁλὶ γὰρ δέδμητο φίλον κῆρ. ᾤδεε δὲ χρόα πάντα, θάλασσα δὲ κήκιε πολλὴ ἂν στόμα τε ῥῖνάς θʼ· ὁ δʼ ἄρʼ ἄπνευστος καὶ ἄναυδος κεῖτʼ ὀλιγηπελέων, κάματος δέ μιν αἰνὸς ἵκανεν. ἀλλʼ ὅτε δή ῥʼ ἄμπνυτο καὶ ἐς φρένα θυμὸς ἀγέρθη, καὶ τότε δὴ κρήδεμνον ἀπὸ ἕο λῦσε θεοῖο. καὶ τὸ μὲν ἐς ποταμὸν ἁλιμυρήεντα μεθῆκεν, ἂψ δʼ ἔφερεν μέγα κῦμα κατὰ ῥόον, αἶψα δʼ ἄρʼ Ἰνὼ δέξατο χερσὶ φίλῃσιν· ὁ δʼ ἐκ ποταμοῖο λιασθεὶς σχοίνῳ ὑπεκλίνθη, κύσε δὲ ζείδωρον ἄρουραν.
"""Alas,"" he cried to himself in his dismay, ""what ever will become of me, and how is it all to end? If I stay here upon the river bed through the long watches of the night, I am so exhausted that the bitter cold and damp may make an end of me - for towards sunrise there will be a keen wind blowing from off the river. If, on the other hand, I climb the hill side, find shelter in the woods, and sleep in some thicket, I may escape the cold and have a good night's rest, but some savage beast may take advantage of me and devour me."""	ὀχθήσας δʼ ἄρα εἶπε πρὸς ὃν μεγαλήτορα θυμόν· ὤ μοι ἐγώ, τί πάθω; τί νύ μοι μήκιστα γένηται; εἰ μέν κʼ ἐν ποταμῷ δυσκηδέα νύκτα φυλάσσω, μή μʼ ἄμυδις στίβη τε κακὴ καὶ θῆλυς ἐέρση ἐξ ὀλιγηπελίης δαμάσῃ κεκαφηότα θυμόν· αὔρη δʼ ἐκ ποταμοῦ ψυχρὴ πνέει ἠῶθι πρό. εἰ δέ κεν ἐς κλιτὺν ἀναβὰς καὶ δάσκιον ὕλην θάμνοις ἐν πυκινοῖσι καταδράθω, εἴ με μεθείη ῥῖγος καὶ κάματος, γλυκερὸς δέ μοι ὕπνος ἐπέλθῃ, δείδω, μὴ θήρεσσιν ἕλωρ καὶ κύρμα γένωμαι.
In the end he deemed it best to take to the woods, and he found one upon some high ground not far from the water. There he crept beneath two shoots of olive that grew from a single stock - the one ungrafted, while the other had been grafted. No wind, however squally, could break through the cover they afforded, nor could the sun's rays pierce them, nor the rain get through them, so closely did they grow into one another. Odysseus crept under these and began to make himself a bed to lie on, for there was a great litter of dead leaves lying about - enough to make a covering for two or three men even in hard winter weather. He was glad enough to see this, so he laid himself down and heaped the leaves all round him. Then, as one who lives alone in the country, far from any neighbor, hides a brand as fire-seed in the ashes to save himself from having to get a light elsewhere, even so did Odysseus cover himself up with leaves; and Athena shed a sweet sleep upon his eyes, closed his eyelids, and made him lose all memories of his sorrows	ὣς ἄρα οἱ φρονέοντι δοάσσατο κέρδιον εἶναι· βῆ ῥʼ ἴμεν εἰς ὕλην· τὴν δὲ σχεδὸν ὕδατος εὗρεν ἐν περιφαινομένῳ· δοιοὺς δʼ ἄρʼ ὑπήλυθε θάμνους, ἐξ ὁμόθεν πεφυῶτας· ὁ μὲν φυλίης, ὁ δʼ ἐλαίης. τοὺς μὲν ἄρʼ οὔτʼ ἀνέμων διάη μένος ὑγρὸν ἀέντων, οὔτε ποτʼ ἠέλιος φαέθων ἀκτῖσιν ἔβαλλεν, οὔτʼ ὄμβρος περάασκε διαμπερές· ὣς ἄρα πυκνοὶ ἀλλήλοισιν ἔφυν ἐπαμοιβαδίς· οὓς ὑπʼ Ὀδυσσεὺς δύσετʼ. ἄφαρ δʼ εὐνὴν ἐπαμήσατο χερσὶ φίλῃσιν εὐρεῖαν· φύλλων γὰρ ἔην χύσις ἤλιθα πολλή, ὅσσον τʼ ἠὲ δύω ἠὲ τρεῖς ἄνδρας ἔρυσθαι ὥρῃ χειμερίῃ, εἰ καὶ μάλα περ χαλεπαίνοι. τὴν μὲν ἰδὼν γήθησε πολύτλας δῖος Ὀδυσσεύς, ἐν δʼ ἄρα μέσσῃ λέκτο, χύσιν δʼ ἐπεχεύατο φύλλων. ὡς δʼ ὅτε τις δαλὸν σποδιῇ ἐνέκρυψε μελαίνῃ ἀγροῦ ἐπʼ ἐσχατιῆς, ᾧ μὴ πάρα γείτονες ἄλλοι, σπέρμα πυρὸς σώζων, ἵνα μή ποθεν ἄλλοθεν αὔοι, ὣς Ὀδυσεὺς φύλλοισι καλύψατο· τῷ δʼ ἄρʼ Ἀθήνη ὕπνον ἐπʼ ὄμμασι χεῦʼ, ἵνα μιν παύσειε τάχιστα

So here Odysseus slept, overcome by sleep and toil; but Athena went off to the and city of the Phaeacians - a people who used to live in the fair town of Hypereia, near the lawless Cyclopes. Now the Cyclopes were stronger in force   than they and plundered them, so their king Nausithoos moved them thence and settled them in Scheria , far from all other people. He surrounded the city with a wall, built houses and temples, and divided the lands among his people; but he was dead and gone to the house of Hades, and King Alkinoos, whose counsels were inspired of heaven, was now reigning. To his house, then, did Athena go in furtherance of the return   of Odysseus.	ὣς ὁ μὲν ἔνθα καθεῦδε πολύτλας δῖος Ὀδυσσεὺς ὕπνῳ καὶ καμάτῳ ἀρημένος· αὐτὰρ Ἀθήνη βῆ ῥʼ ἐς Φαιήκων ἀνδρῶν δῆμόν τε πόλιν τε, οἳ πρὶν μέν ποτʼ ἔναιον ἐν εὐρυχόρῳ Ὑπερείῃ, ἀγχοῦ Κυκλώπων ἀνδρῶν ὑπερηνορεόντων, οἵ σφεας σινέσκοντο, βίηφι δὲ φέρτεροι ἦσαν. ἔνθεν ἀναστήσας ἄγε Ναυσίθοος θεοειδής, εἷσεν δὲ Σχερίῃ, ἑκὰς ἀνδρῶν ἀλφηστάων, ἀμφὶ δὲ τεῖχος ἔλασσε πόλει, καὶ ἐδείματο οἴκους, καὶ νηοὺς ποίησε θεῶν, καὶ ἐδάσσατʼ ἀρούρας. ἀλλʼ ὁ μὲν ἤδη κηρὶ δαμεὶς Ἄϊδόσδε βεβήκει, Ἀλκίνοος δὲ τότʼ ἦρχε, θεῶν ἄπο μήδεα εἰδώς. τοῦ μὲν ἔβη πρὸς δῶμα θεά, γλαυκῶπις Ἀθήνη, νόστον Ὀδυσσῆι μεγαλήτορι μητιόωσα.
She went straight to the beautifully decorated bedroom in which there slept a girl who was as lovely as a goddess, Nausicaa, daughter to King Alkinoos. Two maid servants were sleeping near her, both very pretty, one on either side of the doorway, which was closed with well-made folding doors. Athena took the form of the famous sea leader Dymas’ daughter, who was a bosom friend of Nausicaa and just her own age; then, coming up to the girl's bedside like a breath of wind, she hovered over her head and said:	βῆ δʼ ἴμεν ἐς θάλαμον πολυδαίδαλον, ᾧ ἔνι κούρη κοιμᾶτʼ ἀθανάτῃσι φυὴν καὶ εἶδος ὁμοίη, Ναυσικάα, θυγάτηρ μεγαλήτορος Ἀλκινόοιο, πὰρ δὲ δύʼ ἀμφίπολοι, Χαρίτων ἄπο κάλλος ἔχουσαι, σταθμοῖιν ἑκάτερθε· θύραι δʼ ἐπέκειντο φαειναί. ἡ δʼ ἀνέμου ὡς πνοιὴ ἐπέσσυτο δέμνια κούρης, στῆ δʼ ἄρʼ ὑπὲρ κεφαλῆς, καί μιν πρὸς μῦθον ἔειπεν, εἰδομένη κούρῃ ναυσικλειτοῖο Δύμαντος, ἥ οἱ ὁμηλικίη μὲν ἔην, κεχάριστο δὲ θυμῷ. τῇ μιν ἐεισαμένη προσέφη γλαυκῶπις Ἀθήνη·
"""Nausicaa, what can your mother have been about, to have such a lazy daughter? Here are your clothes all lying in disorder, yet you are going to be married almost immediately, and should not only be well dressed yourself, but should find good clothes for those who attend you. This is the way to get yourself a good name, and to make your father and mother proud of you. Suppose, then, that we make tomorrow a washing day, and start at daybreak. I will come and help you so that you may have everything ready as soon as possible, for all the best young men throughout your own are courting you, and you are not going to remain a young girl much longer. Ask your father, therefore, to have a wagon and mules ready for us at daybreak, to take the rugs, robes, and belts; and you can ride, too, which will be much pleasanter for you than walking, for the washing-cisterns are some way from the town."""	Ναυσικάα, τί νύ σʼ ὧδε μεθήμονα γείνατο μήτηρ; εἵματα μέν τοι κεῖται ἀκηδέα σιγαλόεντα, σοὶ δὲ γάμος σχεδόν ἐστιν, ἵνα χρὴ καλὰ μὲν αὐτὴν ἕννυσθαι, τὰ δὲ τοῖσι παρασχεῖν, οἵ κέ σʼ ἄγωνται. ἐκ γάρ τοι τούτων φάτις ἀνθρώπους ἀναβαίνει ἐσθλή, χαίρουσιν δὲ πατὴρ καὶ πότνια μήτηρ. ἀλλʼ ἴομεν πλυνέουσαι ἅμʼ ἠοῖ φαινομένηφι· καί τοι ἐγὼ συνέριθος ἅμʼ ἕψομαι, ὄφρα τάχιστα ἐντύνεαι, ἐπεὶ οὔ τοι ἔτι δὴν παρθένος ἔσσεαι· ἤδη γάρ σε μνῶνται ἀριστῆες κατὰ δῆμον πάντων Φαιήκων, ὅθι τοι γένος ἐστὶ καὶ αὐτῇ. ἀλλʼ ἄγʼ ἐπότρυνον πατέρα κλυτὸν ἠῶθι πρὸ ἡμιόνους καὶ ἄμαξαν ἐφοπλίσαι, ἥ κεν ἄγῃσι ζῶστρά τε καὶ πέπλους καὶ ῥήγεα σιγαλόεντα. καὶ δὲ σοὶ ὧδʼ αὐτῇ πολὺ κάλλιον ἠὲ πόδεσσιν ἔρχεσθαι· πολλὸν γὰρ ἀπὸ πλυνοί εἰσι πόληος.
When she had said this Athena went away to Olympus , which they say is the everlasting home of the gods. Here no wind beats roughly, and neither rain nor snow can fall; but it abides in everlasting sunshine and in a great peacefulness of light, wherein the blessed gods are illumined for ever and ever. This was the place to which the goddess went when she had given instructions to the girl.	ἡ μὲν ἄρʼ ὣς εἰποῦσʼ ἀπέβη γλαυκῶπις Ἀθήνη Οὔλυμπόνδʼ, ὅθι φασὶ θεῶν ἕδος ἀσφαλὲς αἰεὶ ἔμμεναι. οὔτʼ ἀνέμοισι τινάσσεται οὔτε ποτʼ ὄμβρῳ δεύεται οὔτε χιὼν ἐπιπίλναται, ἀλλὰ μάλʼ αἴθρη πέπταται ἀνέφελος, λευκὴ δʼ ἐπιδέδρομεν αἴγλη· τῷ ἔνι τέρπονται μάκαρες θεοὶ ἤματα πάντα. ἔνθʼ ἀπέβη γλαυκῶπις, ἐπεὶ διεπέφραδε κούρῃ.
By and by morning came and woke Nausicaa, who began wondering about her dream; she therefore went to the other end of the house to tell her father and mother all about it, and found them in their own room. Her mother was sitting by the fireside spinning her purple yarn with her maids around her, and she happened to catch her father just as he was going out to attend a meeting of the town council, which the Phaeacian aldermen had convened. She stopped him and said:	αὐτίκα δʼ Ἠὼς ἦλθεν ἐύθρονος, ἥ μιν ἔγειρε Ναυσικάαν ἐύπεπλον· ἄφαρ δʼ ἀπεθαύμασʼ ὄνειρον, βῆ δʼ ἰέναι διὰ δώμαθʼ, ἵνʼ ἀγγείλειε τοκεῦσιν, πατρὶ φίλῳ καὶ μητρί· κιχήσατο δʼ ἔνδον ἐόντας· ἡ μὲν ἐπʼ ἐσχάρῃ ἧστο σὺν ἀμφιπόλοισι γυναιξὶν ἠλάκατα στρωφῶσʼ ἁλιπόρφυρα· τῷ δὲ θύραζε ἐρχομένῳ ξύμβλητο μετὰ κλειτοὺς βασιλῆας ἐς βουλήν, ἵνα μιν κάλεον Φαίηκες ἀγαυοί. ἡ δὲ μάλʼ ἄγχι στᾶσα φίλον πατέρα προσέειπε·
"""Papa dear, could you manage to let me have a good big wagon? I want to take all our dirty clothes to the river and wash them. You are the chief man here, so it is only right that you should have a clean shirt when you attend meetings of the council. Moreover, you have five sons at home, two of them married, while the other three are good-looking bachelors; you know they always like to have clean linen when they go to a dance  , and I have been thinking about all this."""	πάππα φίλʼ, οὐκ ἂν δή μοι ἐφοπλίσσειας ἀπήνην ὑψηλὴν ἐύκυκλον, ἵνα κλυτὰ εἵματʼ ἄγωμαι ἐς ποταμὸν πλυνέουσα, τά μοι ῥερυπωμένα κεῖται; καὶ δὲ σοὶ αὐτῷ ἔοικε μετὰ πρώτοισιν ἐόντα βουλὰς βουλεύειν καθαρὰ χροΐ εἵματʼ ἔχοντα. πέντε δέ τοι φίλοι υἷες ἐνὶ μεγάροις γεγάασιν, οἱ δύʼ ὀπυίοντες, τρεῖς δʼ ἠίθεοι θαλέθοντες· οἱ δʼ αἰεὶ ἐθέλουσι νεόπλυτα εἵματʼ ἔχοντες ἐς χορὸν ἔρχεσθαι· τὰ δʼ ἐμῇ φρενὶ πάντα μέμηλεν.
"She did not say a word about her own wedding, for she did not like to, but her father knew and said, ""You shall have the mules, my love, and whatever else you have a mind for. Be off with you, and the men shall get you a good strong wagon with a body to it that will hold all your clothes."""	ὣς ἔφατʼ· αἴδετο γὰρ θαλερὸν γάμον ἐξονομῆναι πατρὶ φίλῳ. ὁ δὲ πάντα νόει καὶ ἀμείβετο μύθῳ· οὔτε τοι ἡμιόνων φθονέω, τέκος, οὔτε τευ ἄλλου. ἔρχευ· ἀτάρ τοι δμῶες ἐφοπλίσσουσιν ἀπήνην ὑψηλὴν ἐύκυκλον, ὑπερτερίῃ ἀραρυῖαν.
On this he gave his orders to the servants, who got the wagon out, harnessed the mules, and put them to, while the girl brought the clothes down from the linen room and placed them on the wagon. Her mother prepared her a basket of provisions with all sorts of good things, and a goat skin full of wine; the girl now got into the wagon, and her mother gave her also a golden cruse of oil, that she and her women might anoint themselves. Then she took the whip and reins and lashed the mules on, whereon they set off, and their hoofs clattered on the road. They pulled without flagging, and carried not only Nausicaa and her wash of clothes, but the maids also who were with her.	ὣς εἰπὼν δμώεσσιν ἐκέκλετο, τοὶ δʼ ἐπίθοντο. οἱ μὲν ἄρʼ ἐκτὸς ἄμαξαν ἐύτροχον ἡμιονείην ὥπλεον, ἡμιόνους θʼ ὕπαγον ζεῦξάν θʼ ὑπʼ ἀπήνῃ· κούρη δʼ ἐκ θαλάμοιο φέρεν ἐσθῆτα φαεινήν. καὶ τὴν μὲν κατέθηκεν ἐυξέστῳ ἐπʼ ἀπήνῃ, μήτηρ δʼ ἐν κίστῃ ἐτίθει μενοεικέʼ ἐδωδὴν παντοίην, ἐν δʼ ὄψα τίθει, ἐν δʼ οἶνον ἔχευεν ἀσκῷ ἐν αἰγείῳ· κούρη δʼ ἐπεβήσετʼ ἀπήνης. δῶκεν δὲ χρυσέῃ ἐν ληκύθῳ ὑγρὸν ἔλαιον, ἧος χυτλώσαιτο σὺν ἀμφιπόλοισι γυναιξίν. ἡ δʼ ἔλαβεν μάστιγα καὶ ἡνία σιγαλόεντα, μάστιξεν δʼ ἐλάαν· καναχὴ δʼ ἦν ἡμιόνοιιν. αἱ δʼ ἄμοτον τανύοντο, φέρον δʼ ἐσθῆτα καὶ αὐτήν, οὐκ οἴην, ἅμα τῇ γε καὶ ἀμφίπολοι κίον ἄλλαι.
When they reached the water side they went to the washing-cisterns, through which there ran at all times enough pure water to wash any quantity of linen, no matter how dirty. Here they unharnessed the mules and turned them out to feed on the sweet juicy herbage that grew by the water side. They took the clothes out of the wagon, put them in the water, and vied with one another in treading them in the pits to get the dirt out. After they had washed them and got them quite clean, they laid them out by the sea side, where the waves had raised a high beach of shingle, and set about washing themselves and anointing themselves with olive oil. Then they got their dinner by the side of the stream, and waited for the sun to finish drying the clothes. When they had done dinner they threw off the veils that covered their heads and began to play at ball, while Nausicaa sang for them. As the huntress Artemis goes forth upon the mountains of Taygetus or Erymanthus to hunt wild boars or deer, and the wood-nymphs, daughters of Aegis-bearing Zeus, take their sport along with her (then is Leto proud at seeing her daughter stand a full head taller than the others, and eclipse the loveliest amid a whole bevy of beauties), even so did the girl outshine her handmaids.	αἱ δʼ ὅτε δὴ ποταμοῖο ῥόον περικαλλέʼ ἵκοντο, ἔνθʼ ἦ τοι πλυνοὶ ἦσαν ἐπηετανοί, πολὺ δʼ ὕδωρ καλὸν ὑπεκπρόρεεν μάλα περ ῥυπόωντα καθῆραι, ἔνθʼ αἵ γʼ ἡμιόνους μὲν ὑπεκπροέλυσαν ἀπήνης. καὶ τὰς μὲν σεῦαν ποταμὸν πάρα δινήεντα τρώγειν ἄγρωστιν μελιηδέα· ταὶ δʼ ἀπʼ ἀπήνης εἵματα χερσὶν ἕλοντο καὶ ἐσφόρεον μέλαν ὕδωρ, στεῖβον δʼ ἐν βόθροισι θοῶς ἔριδα προφέρουσαι. αὐτὰρ ἐπεὶ πλῦνάν τε κάθηράν τε ῥύπα πάντα, ἑξείης πέτασαν παρὰ θῖνʼ ἁλός, ἧχι μάλιστα λάιγγας ποτὶ χέρσον ἀποπλύνεσκε θάλασσα. αἱ δὲ λοεσσάμεναι καὶ χρισάμεναι λίπʼ ἐλαίῳ δεῖπνον ἔπειθʼ εἵλοντο παρʼ ὄχθῃσιν ποταμοῖο, εἵματα δʼ ἠελίοιο μένον τερσήμεναι αὐγῇ. αὐτὰρ ἐπεὶ σίτου τάρφθεν δμῳαί τε καὶ αὐτή, σφαίρῃ ταὶ δʼ ἄρʼ ἔπαιζον, ἀπὸ κρήδεμνα βαλοῦσαι· τῇσι δὲ Ναυσικάα λευκώλενος ἤρχετο μολπῆς. οἵη δʼ Ἄρτεμις εἶσι κατʼ οὔρεα ἰοχέαιρα, ἢ κατὰ Τηΰγετον περιμήκετον ἢ Ἐρύμανθον, τερπομένη κάπροισι καὶ ὠκείῃς ἐλάφοισι· τῇ δέ θʼ ἅμα νύμφαι, κοῦραι Διὸς αἰγιόχοιο, ἀγρονόμοι παίζουσι, γέγηθε δέ τε φρένα Λητώ· πασάων δʼ ὑπὲρ ἥ γε κάρη ἔχει ἠδὲ μέτωπα, ῥεῖά τʼ ἀριγνώτη πέλεται, καλαὶ δέ τε πᾶσαι· ὣς ἥ γʼ ἀμφιπόλοισι μετέπρεπε παρθένος ἀδμής.
When it was time for them to start home, and they were folding the clothes and putting them into the wagon, Athena began to consider how Odysseus should wake up and see the handsome girl who was to conduct him to the city of the Phaeacians. The girl, therefore, threw a ball at one of the maids, which missed her and fell into deep water. On this they all shouted, and the noise they made woke Odysseus, who sat up in his bed of leaves and began to wonder what it might all be.	ἀλλʼ ὅτε δὴ ἄρʼ ἔμελλε πάλιν οἶκόνδε νέεσθαι ζεύξασʼ ἡμιόνους πτύξασά τε εἵματα καλά, ἔνθʼ αὖτʼ ἄλλʼ ἐνόησε θεά, γλαυκῶπις Ἀθήνη, ὡς Ὀδυσεὺς ἔγροιτο, ἴδοι τʼ ἐυώπιδα κούρην, ἥ οἱ Φαιήκων ἀνδρῶν πόλιν ἡγήσαιτο. σφαῖραν ἔπειτʼ ἔρριψε μετʼ ἀμφίπολον βασίλεια· ἀμφιπόλου μὲν ἅμαρτε, βαθείῃ δʼ ἔμβαλε δίνῃ· αἱ δʼ ἐπὶ μακρὸν ἄυσαν· ὁ δʼ ἔγρετο δῖος Ὀδυσσεύς, ἑζόμενος δʼ ὥρμαινε κατὰ φρένα καὶ κατὰ θυμόν·
"""Alas,"" said he to himself, ""what kind of people have I come amongst? Are they cruel, savage, and uncivilized not , or hospitable and endowed with a god-fearing ? I seem to hear the voices of young women, and they sound like those of the nymphs that haunt mountaintops, or springs of rivers and meadows of green grass. At any rate I am among a race of men and women. Let me try if I cannot manage to get a look at them."""	ὤ μοι ἐγώ, τέων αὖτε βροτῶν ἐς γαῖαν ἱκάνω; ἦ ῥʼ οἵ γʼ ὑβρισταί τε καὶ ἄγριοι οὐδὲ δίκαιοι, ἦε φιλόξεινοι καί σφιν νόος ἐστὶ θεουδής; ὥς τέ με κουράων ἀμφήλυθε θῆλυς ἀυτή· νυμφάων, αἳ ἔχουσʼ ὀρέων αἰπεινὰ κάρηνα καὶ πηγὰς ποταμῶν καὶ πίσεα ποιήεντα. ἦ νύ που ἀνθρώπων εἰμὶ σχεδὸν αὐδηέντων; ἀλλʼ ἄγʼ ἐγὼν αὐτὸς πειρήσομαι ἠδὲ ἴδωμαι.
As he said this he crept from under his bush, and broke off a bough covered with thick leaves to hide his nakedness. He looked like some lion of the wilderness that stalks about exulting in his strength and defying both wind and rain; his eyes glare as he prowls in quest of oxen, sheep, or deer, for he is famished, and will dare break even into a well-fenced homestead, trying to get at the sheep - even such did Odysseus seem to the young women, as he drew near to them all naked as he was, for he was in great want. On seeing one so unkempt and so begrimed with salt water, the others scampered off along the spits that jutted out into the sea, but the daughter of Alkinoos stood firm, for Athena put courage into her heart and took away all fear from her. She stood right in front of Odysseus, and he doubted whether he should go up to her, throw himself at her feet, and embrace her knees as a suppliant, or stay where he was and entreat her to give him some clothes and show him the way to the town. In the end he deemed it best to entreat her from a distance in case the girl should take offense at his coming near enough to clasp her knees, so he addressed her in honeyed and persuasive language.	ὣς εἰπὼν θάμνων ὑπεδύσετο δῖος Ὀδυσσεύς, ἐκ πυκινῆς δʼ ὕλης πτόρθον κλάσε χειρὶ παχείῃ φύλλων, ὡς ῥύσαιτο περὶ χροῒ μήδεα φωτός. βῆ δʼ ἴμεν ὥς τε λέων ὀρεσίτροφος ἀλκὶ πεποιθώς, ὅς τʼ εἶσʼ ὑόμενος καὶ ἀήμενος, ἐν δέ οἱ ὄσσε δαίεται· αὐτὰρ ὁ βουσὶ μετέρχεται ἢ ὀίεσσιν ἠὲ μετʼ ἀγροτέρας ἐλάφους· κέλεται δέ ἑ γαστὴρ μήλων πειρήσοντα καὶ ἐς πυκινὸν δόμον ἐλθεῖν· ὣς Ὀδυσεὺς κούρῃσιν ἐυπλοκάμοισιν ἔμελλε μίξεσθαι, γυμνός περ ἐών· χρειὼ γὰρ ἵκανε. σμερδαλέος δʼ αὐτῇσι φάνη κεκακωμένος ἅλμῃ, τρέσσαν δʼ ἄλλυδις ἄλλη ἐπʼ ἠιόνας προὐχούσας· οἴη δʼ Ἀλκινόου θυγάτηρ μένε· τῇ γὰρ Ἀθήνη θάρσος ἐνὶ φρεσὶ θῆκε καὶ ἐκ δέος εἵλετο γυίων. στῆ δʼ ἄντα σχομένη· ὁ δὲ μερμήριξεν Ὀδυσσεύς, ἢ γούνων λίσσοιτο λαβὼν ἐυώπιδα κούρην, ἦ αὔτως ἐπέεσσιν ἀποσταδὰ μειλιχίοισι λίσσοιτʼ, εἰ δείξειε πόλιν καὶ εἵματα δοίη. ὣς ἄρα οἱ φρονέοντι δοάσσατο κέρδιον εἶναι, λίσσεσθαι ἐπέεσσιν ἀποσταδὰ μειλιχίοισι, μή οἱ γοῦνα λαβόντι χολώσαιτο φρένα κούρη. αὐτίκα μειλίχιον καὶ κερδαλέον φάτο μῦθον.
"""O queen,"" he said, ""I implore your aid - but tell me, are you a goddess or are you a mortal woman? If you are a goddess and dwell in heaven, I can only conjecture that you are Zeus’ daughter Artemis, for your face and figure resemble none but hers; if on the other hand you are a mortal and live on earth, thrice happy are your father and mother - thrice happy, too, are your brothers and sisters; how proud and delighted they must feel when they see so fair a scion as yourself going out to a dance  ; most happy, however, of all will he be whose wedding gifts have been the richest, and who takes you to his own home. I never yet saw any one so beautiful, neither man nor woman, and am lost in admiration as I behold you. I can only compare you to a young palm tree which I saw when I was at Delos growing near the altar of Apollo - for I was there, too, with many people after me, when I was on that journey which has been the source of all my troubles. Never yet did such a young plant shoot out of the ground as that was, and I admired and wondered at it exactly as I now admire and wonder at yourself. I dare not clasp your knees, but I am in great distress  ; yesterday made the twentieth day that I had been tossing about upon the sea. The winds and waves have taken me all the way from the Ogygian island, and now a has flung me upon this coast that I may endure still further suffering; for I do not think that I have yet come to the end of it, but rather that the gods have still much evil in store for me."	γουνοῦμαί σε, ἄνασσα· θεός νύ τις, ἦ βροτός ἐσσι; εἰ μέν τις θεός ἐσσι, τοὶ οὐρανὸν εὐρὺν ἔχουσιν, Ἀρτέμιδί σε ἐγώ γε, Διὸς κούρῃ μεγάλοιο, εἶδός τε μέγεθός τε φυήν τʼ ἄγχιστα ἐίσκω· εἰ δέ τίς ἐσσι βροτῶν, τοὶ ἐπὶ χθονὶ ναιετάουσιν, τρὶς μάκαρες μὲν σοί γε πατὴρ καὶ πότνια μήτηρ, τρὶς μάκαρες δὲ κασίγνητοι· μάλα πού σφισι θυμὸς αἰὲν ἐυφροσύνῃσιν ἰαίνεται εἵνεκα σεῖο, λευσσόντων τοιόνδε θάλος χορὸν εἰσοιχνεῦσαν. κεῖνος δʼ αὖ περὶ κῆρι μακάρτατος ἔξοχον ἄλλων, ὅς κέ σʼ ἐέδνοισι βρίσας οἶκόνδʼ ἀγάγηται. οὐ γάρ πω τοιοῦτον ἴδον βροτὸν ὀφθαλμοῖσιν, οὔτʼ ἄνδρʼ οὔτε γυναῖκα· σέβας μʼ ἔχει εἰσορόωντα.

"""And now, O queen, have pity upon me, for you are the first person I have met, and I know no one else in this country. Show me the way to your town, and let me have anything that you may have brought here to wrap your clothes in. May heaven grant you in all things your heart's desire - husband, house, and a happy, peaceful home; for there is nothing better in this world than that man and wife should be of one mind in a house. It discomfits their enemies, makes the hearts of their friends glad, and they themselves know more about it than any one."""	ἀλλά, ἄνασσʼ, ἐλέαιρε· σὲ γὰρ κακὰ πολλὰ μογήσας ἐς πρώτην ἱκόμην, τῶν δʼ ἄλλων οὔ τινα οἶδα ἀνθρώπων, οἳ τήνδε πόλιν καὶ γαῖαν ἔχουσιν. ἄστυ δέ μοι δεῖξον, δὸς δὲ ῥάκος ἀμφιβαλέσθαι, εἴ τί που εἴλυμα σπείρων ἔχες ἐνθάδʼ ἰοῦσα. σοὶ δὲ θεοὶ τόσα δοῖεν ὅσα φρεσὶ σῇσι μενοινᾷς, ἄνδρα τε καὶ οἶκον, καὶ ὁμοφροσύνην ὀπάσειαν ἐσθλήν· οὐ μὲν γὰρ τοῦ γε κρεῖσσον καὶ ἄρειον, ἢ ὅθʼ ὁμοφρονέοντε νοήμασιν οἶκον ἔχητον ἀνὴρ ἠδὲ γυνή· πόλλʼ ἄλγεα δυσμενέεσσι, χάρματα δʼ εὐμενέτῃσι, μάλιστα δέ τʼ ἔκλυον αὐτοί.
"To this Nausicaa answered, ""Stranger, you appear to be a sensible, well-disposed person. There is no accounting for luck; Zeus gives prosperity   to rich and poor just as he chooses, so you must take what he has seen fit to send you, and make the best of it. Now, however, that you have come to this our country, you shall not want for clothes nor for anything else that a foreigner in distress may reasonably look for. I will show you the way to the town, and will tell you the name of our people: we are called Phaeacians, and I am daughter to Alkinoos, in whom the whole strength and power   of the state is vested."""	τὸν δʼ αὖ Ναυσικάα λευκώλενος ἀντίον ηὔδα· ξεῖνʼ, ἐπεὶ οὔτε κακῷ οὔτʼ ἄφρονι φωτὶ ἔοικας· Ζεὺς δʼ αὐτὸς νέμει ὄλβον Ὀλύμπιος ἀνθρώποισιν, ἐσθλοῖς ἠδὲ κακοῖσιν, ὅπως ἐθέλῃσιν, ἑκάστῳ· καί που σοὶ τάδʼ ἔδωκε, σὲ δὲ χρὴ τετλάμεν ἔμπης. νῦν δʼ, ἐπεὶ ἡμετέρην τε πόλιν καὶ γαῖαν ἱκάνεις, οὔτʼ οὖν ἐσθῆτος δευήσεαι οὔτε τευ ἄλλου, ὧν ἐπέοιχʼ ἱκέτην ταλαπείριον ἀντιάσαντα. ἄστυ δέ τοι δείξω, ἐρέω δέ τοι οὔνομα λαῶν.

"Then she called her maids and said, ""Stay where you are, you girls. Can you not see a man without running away from him? Do you take him for a robber or a murderer? Neither he nor any one else can come here to do us Phaeacians any harm, for we are dear to the gods, and live apart on a land's end that juts into the sounding sea, and have nothing to do with any other people. This is only some poor man who has lost his way, and we must be kind to him, for strangers and foreigners in distress are under Zeus’ protection, and will take what they can get and be thankful; so, girls, give the poor man something to eat and drink, and wash him in the stream at some place that is sheltered from the wind."""	ἦ ῥα καὶ ἀμφιπόλοισιν ἐυπλοκάμοισι κέλευσε· στῆτέ μοι, ἀμφίπολοι· πόσε φεύγετε φῶτα ἰδοῦσαι; ἦ μή πού τινα δυσμενέων φάσθʼ ἔμμεναι ἀνδρῶν; οὐκ ἔσθʼ οὗτος ἀνὴρ διερὸς βροτὸς οὐδὲ γένηται, ὅς κεν Φαιήκων ἀνδρῶν ἐς γαῖαν ἵκηται δηιοτῆτα φέρων· μάλα γὰρ φίλοι ἀθανάτοισιν. οἰκέομεν δʼ ἀπάνευθε πολυκλύστῳ ἐνὶ πόντῳ, ἔσχατοι, οὐδέ τις ἄμμι βροτῶν ἐπιμίσγεται ἄλλος. ἀλλʼ ὅδε τις δύστηνος ἀλώμενος ἐνθάδʼ ἱκάνει, τὸν νῦν χρὴ κομέειν· πρὸς γὰρ Διός εἰσιν ἅπαντες ξεῖνοί τε πτωχοί τε, δόσις δʼ ὀλίγη τε φίλη τε. ἀλλὰ δότʼ, ἀμφίπολοι, ξείνῳ βρῶσίν τε πόσιν τε, λούσατέ τʼ ἐν ποταμῷ, ὅθʼ ἐπὶ σκέπας ἔστʼ ἀνέμοιο.
"On this the maids left off running away and began calling one another back. They made Odysseus sit down in the shelter as Nausicaa had told them, and brought him a shirt and cloak. They also brought him the little golden cruse of oil, and told him to go wash in the stream. But Odysseus said, ""Young women, please to stand a little on one side that I may wash the brine from my shoulders and anoint myself with oil, for it is long enough since my skin has had a drop of oil upon it. I cannot wash as long as you all keep standing there. I am ashamed to strip before a number of good-looking young women."""	ὣς ἔφαθʼ, αἱ δʼ ἔσταν τε καὶ ἀλλήλῃσι κέλευσαν, κὰδ δʼ ἄρʼ Ὀδυσσῆʼ εἷσαν ἐπὶ σκέπας, ὡς ἐκέλευσεν Ναυσικάα θυγάτηρ μεγαλήτορος Ἀλκινόοιο· πὰρ δʼ ἄρα οἱ φᾶρός τε χιτῶνά τε εἵματʼ ἔθηκαν, δῶκαν δὲ χρυσέῃ ἐν ληκύθῳ ὑγρὸν ἔλαιον, ἤνωγον δʼ ἄρα μιν λοῦσθαι ποταμοῖο ῥοῇσιν. δή ῥα τότʼ ἀμφιπόλοισι μετηύδα δῖος Ὀδυσσεύς· ἀμφίπολοι, στῆθʼ οὕτω ἀπόπροθεν, ὄφρʼ ἐγὼ αὐτὸς ἅλμην ὤμοιιν ἀπολούσομαι, ἀμφὶ δʼ ἐλαίῳ χρίσομαι· ἦ γὰρ δηρὸν ἀπὸ χροός ἐστιν ἀλοιφή. ἄντην δʼ οὐκ ἂν ἐγώ γε λοέσσομαι· αἰδέομαι γὰρ γυμνοῦσθαι κούρῃσιν ἐυπλοκάμοισι μετελθών.
Then they stood on one side and went to tell the girl, while Odysseus washed himself in the stream and scrubbed the brine from his back and from his broad shoulders. When he had thoroughly washed himself, and had got the brine out of his hair, he anointed himself with oil, and put on the clothes which the girl had given him; Athena then made him look taller and stronger than before, she also made the hair grow thick on the top of his head, and flow down in curls like hyacinth blossoms; she poured down gracefulness   over his head and shoulders as a skillful workman who has studied art of all kinds under Hephaistos and Athena enriches a piece of silver plate by gilding it - and his work is full of beauty. Then he went and sat down a little way off upon the beach, looking quite young and handsome  , and the girl gazed on him with admiration; then she said to her maids:	ὣς ἔφαθʼ, αἱ δʼ ἀπάνευθεν ἴσαν, εἶπον δʼ ἄρα κούρῃ. αὐτὰρ ὁ ἐκ ποταμοῦ χρόα νίζετο δῖος Ὀδυσσεὺς ἅλμην, ἥ οἱ νῶτα καὶ εὐρέας ἄμπεχεν ὤμους, ἐκ κεφαλῆς δʼ ἔσμηχεν ἁλὸς χνόον ἀτρυγέτοιο. αὐτὰρ ἐπεὶ δὴ πάντα λοέσσατο καὶ λίπʼ ἄλειψεν, ἀμφὶ δὲ εἵματα ἕσσαθʼ ἅ οἱ πόρε παρθένος ἀδμής, τὸν μὲν Ἀθηναίη θῆκεν Διὸς ἐκγεγαυῖα μείζονά τʼ εἰσιδέειν καὶ πάσσονα, κὰδ δὲ κάρητος οὔλας ἧκε κόμας, ὑακινθίνῳ ἄνθει ὁμοίας. ὡς δʼ ὅτε τις χρυσὸν περιχεύεται ἀργύρῳ ἀνὴρ ἴδρις, ὃν Ἥφαιστος δέδαεν καὶ Παλλὰς Ἀθήνη τέχνην παντοίην, χαρίεντα δὲ ἔργα τελείει, ὣς ἄρα τῷ κατέχευε χάριν κεφαλῇ τε καὶ ὤμοις. ἕζετʼ ἔπειτʼ ἀπάνευθε κιὼν ἐπὶ θῖνα θαλάσσης, κάλλεϊ καὶ χάρισι στίλβων· θηεῖτο δὲ κούρη. δή ῥα τότʼ ἀμφιπόλοισιν ἐυπλοκάμοισι μετηύδα·
"""Hush, my dears, for I want to say something. I believe the gods who live in heaven have sent this man to the Phaeacians. When I first saw him I thought him plain, but now his appearance is like that of the gods who dwell in heaven. I should like my future husband to be just such another as he is, if he would only stay here and not want to go away. However, give him something to eat and drink."""	κλῦτέ μευ, ἀμφίπολοι λευκώλενοι, ὄφρα τι εἴπω. οὐ πάντων ἀέκητι θεῶν, οἳ Ὄλυμπον ἔχουσιν, Φαιήκεσσʼ ὅδʼ ἀνὴρ ἐπιμίσγεται ἀντιθέοισι· πρόσθεν μὲν γὰρ δή μοι ἀεικέλιος δέατʼ εἶναι, νῦν δὲ θεοῖσιν ἔοικε, τοὶ οὐρανὸν εὐρὺν ἔχουσιν. αἲ γὰρ ἐμοὶ τοιόσδε πόσις κεκλημένος εἴη ἐνθάδε ναιετάων, καὶ οἱ ἅδοι αὐτόθι μίμνειν. ἀλλὰ δότʼ, ἀμφίπολοι, ξείνῳ βρῶσίν τε πόσιν τε.
They did as they were told, and set food before Odysseus, who ate and drank ravenously, for it was long since he had had food of any kind. Meanwhile, Nausicaa bethought her of another matter. She got the linen folded and placed in the wagon, she then yoked the mules, and, as she took her seat, she called Odysseus:	ὣς ἔφαθʼ, αἱ δʼ ἄρα τῆς μάλα μὲν κλύον ἠδʼ ἐπίθοντο, πὰρ δʼ ἄρʼ Ὀδυσσῆι ἔθεσαν βρῶσίν τε πόσιν τε. ἦ τοι ὁ πῖνε καὶ ἦσθε πολύτλας δῖος Ὀδυσσεὺς ἁρπαλέως· δηρὸν γὰρ ἐδητύος ἦεν ἄπαστος. αὐτὰρ Ναυσικάα λευκώλενος ἄλλʼ ἐνόησεν· εἵματʼ ἄρα πτύξασα τίθει καλῆς ἐπʼ ἀπήνης, ζεῦξεν δʼ ἡμιόνους κρατερώνυχας, ἂν δʼ ἔβη αὐτή, ὤτρυνεν δʼ Ὀδυσῆα, ἔπος τʼ ἔφατʼ ἔκ τʼ ὀνόμαζεν·
"""Stranger,"" said she, ""rise and let us be going back to the town; I will introduce you at the house of my excellent father, where I can tell you that you will meet all the best people among the Phaeacians. But be sure and do as I bid you, for you seem to be a sensible person. As long as we are going past the fields - and farm lands, follow briskly behind the wagon along with the maids and I will lead the way myself. Presently, however, we shall come to the town, where you will find a high wall running all round it, and a good harbor on either side with a narrow entrance into the city, and the ships will be drawn up by the road side, for every one has a place where his own ship can lie. You will see the market place with a temple of Poseidon in the middle of it, and paved with large stones bedded in the earth. Here people deal in ship's gear of all kinds, such as cables and sails, and here, too, are the places where oars are made, for the Phaeacians are not a nation of archers; they know nothing about bows and arrows, but are a sea-faring folk, and pride themselves on their masts, oars, and ships, with which they travel far over the sea."	ὄρσεο δὴ νῦν, ξεῖνε, πόλινδʼ ἴμεν ὄφρα σε πέμψω πατρὸς ἐμοῦ πρὸς δῶμα δαΐφρονος, ἔνθα σέ φημι πάντων Φαιήκων εἰδησέμεν ὅσσοι ἄριστοι. ἀλλὰ μάλʼ ὧδʼ ἔρδειν, δοκέεις δέ μοι οὐκ ἀπινύσσειν· ὄφρʼ ἂν μέν κʼ ἀγροὺς ἴομεν καὶ ἔργʼ ἀνθρώπων, τόφρα σὺν ἀμφιπόλοισι μεθʼ ἡμιόνους καὶ ἄμαξαν καρπαλίμως ἔρχεσθαι· ἐγὼ δʼ ὁδὸν ἡγεμονεύσω. αὐτὰρ ἐπὴν πόλιος ἐπιβήομεν, ἣν πέρι πύργος ὑψηλός, καλὸς δὲ λιμὴν ἑκάτερθε πόληος, λεπτὴ δʼ εἰσίθμη· νῆες δʼ ὁδὸν ἀμφιέλισσαι εἰρύαται· πᾶσιν γὰρ ἐπίστιόν ἐστιν ἑκάστῳ. ἔνθα δέ τέ σφʼ ἀγορὴ καλὸν Ποσιδήιον ἀμφίς, ῥυτοῖσιν λάεσσι κατωρυχέεσσʼ ἀραρυῖα. ἔνθα δὲ νηῶν ὅπλα μελαινάων ἀλέγουσι, πείσματα καὶ σπεῖρα, καὶ ἀποξύνουσιν ἐρετμά. οὐ γὰρ Φαιήκεσσι μέλει βιὸς οὐδὲ φαρέτρη, ἀλλʼ ἱστοὶ καὶ ἐρετμὰ νεῶν καὶ νῆες ἐῖσαι, ᾗσιν ἀγαλλόμενοι πολιὴν περόωσι θάλασσαν.
"""I am afraid of the gossip and scandal that may be set on foot against me later on; for the people in the here are very ill-natured, and some lowly person, if he met us, might say, ‘Who is this fine-looking stranger that is going about with Nausicaa? Where did she find him? I suppose she is going to marry him. Perhaps he is a vagabond sailor whom she has taken from some foreign vessel, for we have no neighbors; or some god has at last come down from heaven in answer to her prayers, and she is going to live with him all the rest of her life. It would be a better thing if she would take herself away and find a husband somewhere else, for she will not look at one of the many excellent young Phaeacians in the who woo her.’ This is the kind of disparaging remark that would be made about me, and I could not complain, for I should myself be scandalized at seeing any other girl do the like, and go about with men in spite of everybody, while her father and mother were still alive, and without having been married in the face of all the world."	τῶν ἀλεείνω φῆμιν ἀδευκέα, μή τις ὀπίσσω μωμεύῃ· μάλα δʼ εἰσὶν ὑπερφίαλοι κατὰ δῆμον· καί νύ τις ὧδʼ εἴπῃσι κακώτερος ἀντιβολήσας· τίς δʼ ὅδε Ναυσικάᾳ ἕπεται καλός τε μέγας τε ξεῖνος; ποῦ δέ μιν εὗρε; πόσις νύ οἱ ἔσσεται αὐτῇ. ἦ τινά που πλαγχθέντα κομίσσατο ἧς ἀπὸ νηὸς ἀνδρῶν τηλεδαπῶν, ἐπεὶ οὔ τινες ἐγγύθεν εἰσίν· ἤ τίς οἱ εὐξαμένῃ πολυάρητος θεὸς ἦλθεν οὐρανόθεν καταβάς, ἕξει δέ μιν ἤματα πάντα. βέλτερον, εἰ καὐτή περ ἐποιχομένη πόσιν εὗρεν ἄλλοθεν· ἦ γὰρ τούσδε γʼ ἀτιμάζει κατὰ δῆμον Φαίηκας, τοί μιν μνῶνται πολέες τε καὶ ἐσθλοί. ὣς ἐρέουσιν, ἐμοὶ δέ κʼ ὀνείδεα ταῦτα γένοιτο. καὶ δʼ ἄλλῃ νεμεσῶ, ἥ τις τοιαῦτά γε ῥέζοι, ἥ τʼ ἀέκητι φίλων πατρὸς καὶ μητρὸς ἐόντων, ἀνδράσι μίσγηται, πρίν γʼ ἀμφάδιον γάμον ἐλθεῖν.
"""If, therefore, you want my father to give you an escort and to help you home  , do as I bid you; you will see a beautiful grove of poplars by the road side dedicated to Athena; it has a well in it and a meadow all round it. Here my father has a field of fertile garden ground, about as far from the town as a man's voice will carry. Sit down there and wait for a while till the rest of us can get into the town and reach my father's house. Then, when you think we must have done this, come into the town and ask the way to the house of my father Alkinoos. You will have no difficulty in finding it; any child will point it out to you, for no one else in the whole town has anything like such a fine house as he has. When you have got past the gates and through the outer court, go right across the inner court till you come to my mother. You will find her sitting by the fire and spinning her purple wool by firelight. It is a fine sight to see her as she leans back against one of the bearing-posts with her maids all ranged behind her. Close to her seat stands that of my father, on which he sits and topes like an immortal god. Never mind him, but go up to my mother, and lay your hands upon her knees if you would get home quickly. If you can win her over, you may hope to see your own country again, no matter how distant it may be."""	ξεῖνε, σὺ δʼ ὦκʼ ἐμέθεν ξυνίει ἔπος, ὄφρα τάχιστα πομπῆς καὶ νόστοιο τύχῃς παρὰ πατρὸς ἐμοῖο. δήεις ἀγλαὸν ἄλσος Ἀθήνης ἄγχι κελεύθου αἰγείρων· ἐν δὲ κρήνη νάει, ἀμφὶ δὲ λειμών· ἔνθα δὲ πατρὸς ἐμοῦ τέμενος τεθαλυῖά τʼ ἀλωή, τόσσον ἀπὸ πτόλιος, ὅσσον τε γέγωνε βοήσας. ἔνθα καθεζόμενος μεῖναι χρόνον, εἰς ὅ κεν ἡμεῖς ἄστυδε ἔλθωμεν καὶ ἱκώμεθα δώματα πατρός. αὐτὰρ ἐπὴν ἡμέας ἔλπῃ ποτὶ δώματʼ ἀφῖχθαι, καὶ τότε Φαιήκων ἴμεν ἐς πόλιν ἠδʼ ἐρέεσθαι δώματα πατρὸς ἐμοῦ μεγαλήτορος Ἀλκινόοιο. ῥεῖα δʼ ἀρίγνωτʼ ἐστί, καὶ ἂν πάϊς ἡγήσαιτο νήπιος· οὐ μὲν γάρ τι ἐοικότα τοῖσι τέτυκται δώματα Φαιήκων, οἷος δόμος Ἀλκινόοιο ἥρωος. ἀλλʼ ὁπότʼ ἄν σε δόμοι κεκύθωσι καὶ αὐλή, ὦκα μάλα μεγάροιο διελθέμεν, ὄφρʼ ἂν ἵκηαι μητέρʼ ἐμήν· ἡ δʼ ἧσται ἐπʼ ἐσχάρῃ ἐν πυρὸς αὐγῇ, ἠλάκατα στρωφῶσʼ ἁλιπόρφυρα, θαῦμα ἰδέσθαι, κίονι κεκλιμένη· δμωαὶ δέ οἱ εἵατʼ ὄπισθεν. ἔνθα δὲ πατρὸς ἐμοῖο θρόνος ποτικέκλιται αὐτῇ, τῷ ὅ γε οἰνοποτάζει ἐφήμενος ἀθάνατος ὥς. τὸν παραμειψάμενος μητρὸς περὶ γούνασι χεῖρας βάλλειν ἡμετέρης, ἵνα νόστιμον ἦμαρ ἴδηαι χαίρων καρπαλίμως, εἰ καὶ μάλα τηλόθεν ἐσσί. εἴ κέν τοι κείνη γε φίλα φρονέῃσʼ ἐνὶ θυμῷ, ἐλπωρή τοι ἔπειτα φίλους τʼ ἰδέειν καὶ ἱκέσθαι οἶκον ἐυκτίμενον καὶ σὴν ἐς πατρίδα γαῖαν.
So saying she lashed the mules with her whip and they left the river. The mules drew well and their hoofs went up and down upon the road. She was careful not to go too fast for Odysseus and the maids who were following on foot along with the wagon, so she plied her whip with judgment  . As the sun was going down they came to the sacred grove of Athena, and there Odysseus sat down and prayed to the mighty daughter of Zeus.	ὣς ἄρα φωνήσασʼ ἵμασεν μάστιγι φαεινῇ ἡμιόνους· αἱ δʼ ὦκα λίπον ποταμοῖο ῥέεθρα. αἱ δʼ ἐὺ μὲν τρώχων, ἐὺ δὲ πλίσσοντο πόδεσσιν· ἡ δὲ μάλʼ ἡνιόχευεν, ὅπως ἅμʼ ἑποίατο πεζοὶ ἀμφίπολοί τʼ Ὀδυσεύς τε, νόῳ δʼ ἐπέβαλλεν ἱμάσθλην. δύσετό τʼ ἠέλιος καὶ τοὶ κλυτὸν ἄλσος ἵκοντο ἱρὸν Ἀθηναίης, ἵνʼ ἄρʼ ἕζετο δῖος Ὀδυσσεύς. αὐτίκʼ ἔπειτʼ ἠρᾶτο Διὸς κούρῃ μεγάλοιο·
"""Hear me,"" he cried, ""daughter of Aegis-bearing Zeus, unweariable, hear me now, for you gave no heed to my prayers when Poseidon was wrecking me. Now, therefore, have pity upon me and grant that I may find friends and be hospitably received by the Phaeacians."""	κλῦθί μευ, αἰγιόχοιο Διὸς τέκος, Ἀτρυτώνη· νῦν δή πέρ μευ ἄκουσον, ἐπεὶ πάρος οὔ ποτʼ ἄκουσας ῥαιομένου, ὅτε μʼ ἔρραιε κλυτὸς ἐννοσίγαιος. δός μʼ ἐς Φαίηκας φίλον ἐλθεῖν ἠδʼ ἐλεεινόν.
Thus did he pray, and Athena heard his prayer, but she would not show herself to him openly, for she was afraid of her uncle Poseidon, who was still furious in his endeavors to prevent Odysseus from getting home.	ὣς ἔφατʼ εὐχόμενος, τοῦ δʼ ἔκλυε Παλλὰς Ἀθήνη. αὐτῷ δʼ οὔ πω φαίνετʼ ἐναντίη· αἴδετο γάρ ῥα πατροκασίγνητον· ὁ δʼ ἐπιζαφελῶς μενέαινεν
Thus, then, did Odysseus wait and pray; but the girl drove on to the town. When she reached her father's house she drew up at the gateway, and her brothers - comely as the gods - gathered round her, took the mules out of the wagon, and carried the clothes into the house, while she went to her own room, where an old servant, Eurymedousa of Apeira, lit the fire for her. This old woman had been brought by sea from Apeira, and had been chosen as a prize for Alkinoos because he was king over the Phaeacians, and the people in the obeyed him as though he were a god. She had been nurse to Nausicaa, and had now lit the fire for her, and brought her supper for her into her own room.	ὧς ὁ μὲν ἔνθʼ ἠρᾶτο πολύτλας δῖος Ὀδυσσεύς, κούρην δὲ προτὶ ἄστυ φέρεν μένος ἡμιόνοιιν. ἡ δʼ ὅτε δὴ οὗ πατρὸς ἀγακλυτὰ δώμαθʼ ἵκανε, στῆσεν ἄρʼ ἐν προθύροισι, κασίγνητοι δέ μιν ἀμφὶς ἵσταντʼ ἀθανάτοις ἐναλίγκιοι, οἵ ῥʼ ὑπʼ ἀπήνης ἡμιόνους ἔλυον ἐσθῆτά τε ἔσφερον εἴσω. αὐτὴ δʼ ἐς θάλαμον ἑὸν ἤιε· δαῖε δέ οἱ πῦρ γρῆυς Ἀπειραίη, θαλαμηπόλος Εὐρυμέδουσα, τήν ποτʼ Ἀπείρηθεν νέες ἤγαγον ἀμφιέλισσαι· Ἀλκινόῳ δʼ αὐτὴν γέρας ἔξελον, οὕνεκα πᾶσιν Φαιήκεσσιν ἄνασσε, θεοῦ δʼ ὣς δῆμος ἄκουεν· ἣ τρέφε Ναυσικάαν λευκώλενον ἐν μεγάροισιν. ἥ οἱ πῦρ ἀνέκαιε καὶ εἴσω δόρπον ἐκόσμει.
Presently Odysseus got up to go towards the town; and Athena shed a thick mist all round him to hide him in case any of the proud Phaeacians who met him should be rude to him, or ask him who he was. Then, as he was just entering the town, she came towards him in the likeness of a little girl carrying a pitcher. She stood right in front of him, and Odysseus said:	καὶ τότʼ Ὀδυσσεὺς ὦρτο πόλινδʼ ἴμεν· ἀμφὶ δʼ Ἀθήνη πολλὴν ἠέρα χεῦε φίλα φρονέουσʼ Ὀδυσῆι, μή τις Φαιήκων μεγαθύμων ἀντιβολήσας κερτομέοι τʼ ἐπέεσσι καὶ ἐξερέοιθʼ ὅτις εἴη. ἀλλʼ ὅτε δὴ ἄρʼ ἔμελλε πόλιν δύσεσθαι ἐραννήν, ἔνθα οἱ ἀντεβόλησε θεά, γλαυκῶπις Ἀθήνη, παρθενικῇ ἐικυῖα νεήνιδι, κάλπιν ἐχούσῃ. στῆ δὲ πρόσθʼ αὐτοῦ, ὁ δʼ ἀνείρετο δῖος Ὀδυσσεύς·
"""My dear, will you be so kind as to show me the house of king Alkinoos? I am an unfortunate foreigner in distress, and do not know one in your town and country."""	ὦ τέκος, οὐκ ἄν μοι δόμον ἀνέρος ἡγήσαιο Ἀλκινόου, ὃς τοῖσδε μετʼ ἀνθρώποισι ἀνάσσει; καὶ γὰρ ἐγὼ ξεῖνος ταλαπείριος ἐνθάδʼ ἱκάνω τηλόθεν ἐξ ἀπίης γαίης· τῷ οὔ τινα οἶδα ἀνθρώπων, οἳ τήνδε πόλιν καὶ γαῖαν ἔχουσιν.
"Then Athena said, ""Yes, father stranger, I will show you the house you want, for Alkinoos lives quite close to my own father. I will go before you and show the way, but say not a word as you go, and do not look at any man, nor ask him questions; for the people here cannot abide strangers, and do not like men who come from some other place. They are a sea-faring folk, and sail the seas by the grace of Poseidon in ships that glide along like thought, or as a bird in the air."""	τὸν δʼ αὖτε προσέειπε θεά, γλαυκῶπις Ἀθήνη· τοιγὰρ ἐγώ τοι, ξεῖνε πάτερ, δόμον, ὅν με κελεύεις, δείξω, ἐπεί μοι πατρὸς ἀμύμονος ἐγγύθι ναίει. ἀλλʼ ἴθι σιγῇ τοῖον, ἐγὼ δʼ ὁδὸν ἡγεμονεύσω, μηδέ τινʼ ἀνθρώπων προτιόσσεο μηδʼ ἐρέεινε. οὐ γὰρ ξείνους οἵδε μάλʼ ἀνθρώπους ἀνέχονται, οὐδʼ ἀγαπαζόμενοι φιλέουσʼ ὅς κʼ ἄλλοθεν ἔλθῃ. νηυσὶ θοῇσιν τοί γε πεποιθότες ὠκείῃσι λαῖτμα μέγʼ ἐκπερόωσιν, ἐπεί σφισι δῶκʼ ἐνοσίχθων· τῶν νέες ὠκεῖαι ὡς εἰ πτερὸν ἠὲ νόημα.
On this she led the way, and Odysseus followed in her steps; but not one of the Phaeacians could see him as he passed through the city in the midst of them; for the great goddess Athena in her good will towards him had hidden him in a thick cloud of darkness. He admired their harbors, ships, places of assembly, and the lofty walls of the city, which, with the palisade on top of them, were very striking, and when they reached the king's house Athena said:	ὣς ἄρα φωνήσασʼ ἡγήσατο Παλλὰς Ἀθήνη καρπαλίμως· ὁ δʼ ἔπειτα μετʼ ἴχνια βαῖνε θεοῖο. τὸν δʼ ἄρα Φαίηκες ναυσικλυτοὶ οὐκ ἐνόησαν ἐρχόμενον κατὰ ἄστυ διὰ σφέας· οὐ γὰρ Ἀθήνη εἴα ἐυπλόκαμος, δεινὴ θεός, ἥ ῥά οἱ ἀχλὺν θεσπεσίην κατέχευε φίλα φρονέουσʼ ἐνὶ θυμῷ. θαύμαζεν δʼ Ὀδυσεὺς λιμένας καὶ νῆας ἐίσας αὐτῶν θʼ ἡρώων ἀγορὰς καὶ τείχεα μακρὰ ὑψηλά, σκολόπεσσιν ἀρηρότα, θαῦμα ἰδέσθαι. ἀλλʼ ὅτε δὴ βασιλῆος ἀγακλυτὰ δώμαθʼ ἵκοντο, τοῖσι δὲ μύθων ἦρχε θεά, γλαυκῶπις Ἀθήνη·
"""This is the house, father stranger, which you would have me show you. You will find a number of great people sitting at table, but do not be afraid; go straight in, for the bolder a man is the more likely he is to carry his point, even though he is a stranger. First find the queen. Her name is Arete, and she comes of the same family as her husband Alkinoos. They both descend originally from Poseidon, who was father to Nausithoos by Periboia, a woman of great beauty. Periboia was the youngest daughter of Eurymedon, who at one time reigned over the giants, but he ruined his ill-fated people and lost his own life to boot."	οὗτος δή τοι, ξεῖνε πάτερ, δόμος, ὅν με κελεύεις πεφραδέμεν· δήεις δὲ διοτρεφέας βασιλῆας δαίτην δαινυμένους· σὺ δʼ ἔσω κίε, μηδέ τι θυμῷ τάρβει· θαρσαλέος γὰρ ἀνὴρ ἐν πᾶσιν ἀμείνων ἔργοισιν τελέθει, εἰ καί ποθεν ἄλλοθεν ἔλθοι. δέσποιναν μὲν πρῶτα κιχήσεαι ἐν μεγάροισιν· Ἀρήτη δʼ ὄνομʼ ἐστὶν ἐπώνυμον, ἐκ δὲ τοκήων τῶν αὐτῶν οἵ περ τέκον Ἀλκίνοον βασιλῆα.

"""Poseidon, however, lay with his daughter, and she had a son by him, the great Nausithoos, who reigned over the Phaeacians. Nausithoos had two sons Rhexenor and Alkinoos; Apollo killed the first of them while he was still a bridegroom and without male issue; but he left a daughter Arete, whom Alkinoos married, and honors as no other woman is honored of all those that keep house along with their husbands."	τῇ δὲ Ποσειδάων ἐμίγη καὶ ἐγείνατο παῖδα Ναυσίθοον μεγάθυμον, ὃς ἐν Φαίηξιν ἄνασσε· Ναυσίθοος δʼ ἔτεκεν Ῥηξήνορά τʼ Ἀλκίνοόν τε. τὸν μὲν ἄκουρον ἐόντα βάλʼ ἀργυρότοξος Ἀπόλλων νυμφίον ἐν μεγάρῳ, μίαν οἴην παῖδα λιπόντα Ἀρήτην· τὴν δʼ Ἀλκίνοος ποιήσατʼ ἄκοιτιν, καί μιν ἔτισʼ, ὡς οὔ τις ἐπὶ χθονὶ τίεται ἄλλη, ὅσσαι νῦν γε γυναῖκες ὑπʼ ἀνδράσιν οἶκον ἔχουσιν.
"""Thus she both was, and still is, respected beyond measure by her children, by Alkinoos himself, and by the whole people, who look upon her as a goddess, and greet her whenever she goes about the city, for she is a thoroughly good woman both in head   and heart, and when any women are friends of hers, she will help their husbands also to settle their disputes. If you can gain her good will, you may have every hope of seeing your friends again, and getting safely back to your home and country."""	ὣς κείνη περὶ κῆρι τετίμηταί τε καὶ ἔστιν ἔκ τε φίλων παίδων ἔκ τʼ αὐτοῦ Ἀλκινόοιο καὶ λαῶν, οἵ μίν ῥα θεὸν ὣς εἰσορόωντες δειδέχαται μύθοισιν, ὅτε στείχῃσʼ ἀνὰ ἄστυ. οὐ μὲν γάρ τι νόου γε καὶ αὐτὴ δεύεται ἐσθλοῦ· ᾗσι τʼ ἐὺ φρονέῃσι καὶ ἀνδράσι νείκεα λύει. εἴ κέν τοι κείνη γε φίλα φρονέῃσʼ ἐνὶ θυμῷ, ἐλπωρή τοι ἔπειτα φίλους τʼ ἰδέειν καὶ ἱκέσθαι οἶκον ἐς ὑψόροφον καὶ σὴν ἐς πατρίδα γαῖαν.
Then Athena left Scheria and went away over the sea. She went to Marathon and to the spacious streets of Athens , where she entered the abode of Erechtheus; but Odysseus went on to the house of Alkinoos, and he pondered much as he paused a while before reaching the threshold of bronze, for the splendor of the palace was like that of the sun or moon. The walls on either side were of bronze from end to end, and the cornice was of blue enamel. The doors were gold, and hung on pillars of silver that rose from a floor of bronze, while the lintel was silver and the hook of the door was of gold.	ὣς ἄρα φωνήσασʼ ἀπέβη γλαυκῶπις Ἀθήνη πόντον ἐπʼ ἀτρύγετον, λίπε δὲ Σχερίην ἐρατεινήν, ἵκετο δʼ ἐς Μαραθῶνα καὶ εὐρυάγυιαν Ἀθήνην, δῦνε δʼ Ἐρεχθῆος πυκινὸν δόμον. αὐτὰρ Ὀδυσσεὺς Ἀλκινόου πρὸς δώματʼ ἴε κλυτά· πολλὰ δέ οἱ κῆρ ὥρμαινʼ ἱσταμένῳ, πρὶν χάλκεον οὐδὸν ἱκέσθαι. ὥς τε γὰρ ἠελίου αἴγλη πέλεν ἠὲ σελήνης δῶμα καθʼ ὑψερεφὲς μεγαλήτορος Ἀλκινόοιο. χάλκεοι μὲν γὰρ τοῖχοι ἐληλέδατʼ ἔνθα καὶ ἔνθα, ἐς μυχὸν ἐξ οὐδοῦ, περὶ δὲ θριγκὸς κυάνοιο· χρύσειαι δὲ θύραι πυκινὸν δόμον ἐντὸς ἔεργον· σταθμοὶ δʼ ἀργύρεοι ἐν χαλκέῳ ἕστασαν οὐδῷ, ἀργύρεον δʼ ἐφʼ ὑπερθύριον, χρυσέη δὲ κορώνη.
On either side there stood gold and silver mastiffs which Hephaistos, with his consummate skill, had fashioned expressly to keep watch over the palace of king Alkinoos; so they were immortal and could never grow old. Seats were ranged all along the wall, here and there from one end to the other, with coverings of fine woven work which the women of the house had made. Here the chief persons of the Phaeacians used to sit and eat and drink, for there was abundance at all seasons; and there were golden figures of young men with lighted torches in their hands, raised on pedestals, to give light by night to those who were at table. There are fifty maid servants in the house, some of whom are always grinding rich yellow grain at the mill, while others work at the loom, or sit and spin, and their shuttles go, backwards and forwards like the fluttering of aspen leaves, while the linen is so closely woven that it will turn oil. As the Phaeacians are the best sailors in the world, so their women excel all others in weaving, for Athena has taught them all manner of useful arts, and they are very intelligent.	χρύσειοι δʼ ἑκάτερθε καὶ ἀργύρεοι κύνες ἦσαν, οὓς Ἥφαιστος ἔτευξεν ἰδυίῃσι πραπίδεσσι δῶμα φυλασσέμεναι μεγαλήτορος Ἀλκινόοιο, ἀθανάτους ὄντας καὶ ἀγήρως ἤματα πάντα. ἐν δὲ θρόνοι περὶ τοῖχον ἐρηρέδατʼ ἔνθα καὶ ἔνθα, ἐς μυχὸν ἐξ οὐδοῖο διαμπερές, ἔνθʼ ἐνὶ πέπλοι λεπτοὶ ἐύννητοι βεβλήατο, ἔργα γυναικῶν. ἔνθα δὲ Φαιήκων ἡγήτορες ἑδριόωντο πίνοντες καὶ ἔδοντες· ἐπηετανὸν γὰρ ἔχεσκον. χρύσειοι δʼ ἄρα κοῦροι ἐυδμήτων ἐπὶ βωμῶν ἕστασαν αἰθομένας δαΐδας μετὰ χερσὶν ἔχοντες, φαίνοντες νύκτας κατὰ δώματα δαιτυμόνεσσι. πεντήκοντα δέ οἱ δμωαὶ κατὰ δῶμα γυναῖκες αἱ μὲν ἀλετρεύουσι μύλῃς ἔπι μήλοπα καρπόν, αἱ δʼ ἱστοὺς ὑφόωσι καὶ ἠλάκατα στρωφῶσιν ἥμεναι, οἷά τε φύλλα μακεδνῆς αἰγείροιο· καιρουσσέων δʼ ὀθονέων ἀπολείβεται ὑγρὸν ἔλαιον. ὅσσον Φαίηκες περὶ πάντων ἴδριες ἀνδρῶν νῆα θοὴν ἐνὶ πόντῳ ἐλαυνέμεν, ὣς δὲ γυναῖκες ἱστῶν τεχνῆσσαι· πέρι γάρ σφισι δῶκεν Ἀθήνη ἔργα τʼ ἐπίστασθαι περικαλλέα καὶ φρένας ἐσθλάς.
Outside the gate of the outer court there is a large garden of about four acres with a wall all round it. It is full of beautiful trees - pears, pomegranates, and the most delicious apples. There are luscious figs also, and olives in full growth. The fruits never rot nor fail all the year round, neither winter nor summer, for the air is so soft that a new crop ripens before the old has dropped. Pear grows on pear, apple on apple, and fig on fig, and so also with the grapes, for there is an excellent vineyard: on the level ground of a part of this, the grapes are being made into raisins; in another part they are being gathered; some are being trodden in the wine tubs, others further on have shed their blossom and are beginning to show fruit, others again are just changing color. In the furthest part of the ground there are beautifully arranged beds of flowers that are in bloom all the year round. Two streams go through it, the one turned in ducts throughout the whole garden, while the other is carried under the ground of the outer court to the house itself, and the town's people draw water from it. Such, then, were the splendors with which the gods had endowed the house of king Alkinoos.	ἔκτοσθεν δʼ αὐλῆς μέγας ὄρχατος ἄγχι θυράων τετράγυος· περὶ δʼ ἕρκος ἐλήλαται ἀμφοτέρωθεν. ἔνθα δὲ δένδρεα μακρὰ πεφύκασι τηλεθόωντα, ὄγχναι καὶ ῥοιαὶ καὶ μηλέαι ἀγλαόκαρποι συκέαι τε γλυκεραὶ καὶ ἐλαῖαι τηλεθόωσαι. τάων οὔ ποτε καρπὸς ἀπόλλυται οὐδʼ ἀπολείπει χείματος οὐδὲ θέρευς, ἐπετήσιος· ἀλλὰ μάλʼ αἰεὶ Ζεφυρίη πνείουσα τὰ μὲν φύει, ἄλλα δὲ πέσσει. ὄγχνη ἐπʼ ὄγχνῃ γηράσκει, μῆλον δʼ ἐπὶ μήλῳ, αὐτὰρ ἐπὶ σταφυλῇ σταφυλή, σῦκον δʼ ἐπὶ σύκῳ. ἔνθα δέ οἱ πολύκαρπος ἀλωὴ ἐρρίζωται, τῆς ἕτερον μὲν θειλόπεδον λευρῷ ἐνὶ χώρῳ τέρσεται ἠελίῳ, ἑτέρας δʼ ἄρα τε τρυγόωσιν, ἄλλας δὲ τραπέουσι· πάροιθε δέ τʼ ὄμφακές εἰσιν ἄνθος ἀφιεῖσαι, ἕτεραι δʼ ὑποπερκάζουσιν. ἔνθα δὲ κοσμηταὶ πρασιαὶ παρὰ νείατον ὄρχον παντοῖαι πεφύασιν, ἐπηετανὸν γανόωσαι· ἐν δὲ δύω κρῆναι ἡ μέν τʼ ἀνὰ κῆπον ἅπαντα σκίδναται, ἡ δʼ ἑτέρωθεν ὑπʼ αὐλῆς οὐδὸν ἵησι πρὸς δόμον ὑψηλόν, ὅθεν ὑδρεύοντο πολῖται. τοῖʼ ἄρʼ ἐν Ἀλκινόοιο θεῶν ἔσαν ἀγλαὰ δῶρα.
So here Odysseus stood for a while and looked about him, but when he had looked long enough he crossed the threshold and went within the precincts of the house. There he found all the chief people among the Phaeacians making their drink-offerings to Hermes, which they always did the last thing before going away for the night. He went straight through the court, still hidden by the cloak of darkness in which Athena had enveloped him, till he reached Arete and King Alkinoos; then he laid his hands upon the knees of the queen, and at that moment the miraculous darkness fell away from him and he became visible. Every one was speechless with surprise at seeing a man there, but Odysseus began at once with his petition.	ἔνθα στὰς θηεῖτο πολύτλας δῖος Ὀδυσσεύς. αὐτὰρ ἐπεὶ δὴ πάντα ἑῷ θηήσατο θυμῷ, καρπαλίμως ὑπὲρ οὐδὸν ἐβήσετο δώματος εἴσω. εὗρε δὲ Φαιήκων ἡγήτορας ἠδὲ μέδοντας σπένδοντας δεπάεσσιν ἐυσκόπῳ ἀργεϊφόντῃ, ᾧ πυμάτῳ σπένδεσκον, ὅτε μνησαίατο κοίτου. αὐτὰρ ὁ βῆ διὰ δῶμα πολύτλας δῖος Ὀδυσσεὺς πολλὴν ἠέρʼ ἔχων, ἥν οἱ περίχευεν Ἀθήνη, ὄφρʼ ἵκετʼ Ἀρήτην τε καὶ Ἀλκίνοον βασιλῆα. ἀμφὶ δʼ ἄρʼ Ἀρήτης βάλε γούνασι χεῖρας Ὀδυσσεύς, καὶ τότε δή ῥʼ αὐτοῖο πάλιν χύτο θέσφατος ἀήρ. οἱ δʼ ἄνεῳ ἐγένοντο, δόμον κάτα φῶτα ἰδόντες· θαύμαζον δʼ ὁρόωντες. ὁ δὲ λιτάνευεν Ὀδυσσεύς·
"""Queen Arete,"" he exclaimed, ""daughter of great Rhexenor, in my distress I humbly pray you, as also your husband and these your guests (whom may heaven prosper with long life and happiness  , and may they leave their possessions to their children, and all the honors conferred upon them by the state  ) to help me home to my own country as soon as possible; for I have been long in trouble and away from my friends."""	Ἀρήτη, θύγατερ Ῥηξήνορος ἀντιθέοιο, σόν τε πόσιν σά τε γούναθʼ ἱκάνω πολλὰ μογήσας τούσδε τε δαιτυμόνας· τοῖσιν θεοὶ ὄλβια δοῖεν ζωέμεναι, καὶ παισὶν ἐπιτρέψειεν ἕκαστος κτήματʼ ἐνὶ μεγάροισι γέρας θʼ ὅ τι δῆμος ἔδωκεν· αὐτὰρ ἐμοὶ πομπὴν ὀτρύνετε πατρίδʼ ἱκέσθαι θᾶσσον, ἐπεὶ δὴ δηθὰ φίλων ἄπο πήματα πάσχω.
Then he sat down on the hearth among the ashes and they all held their peace, till presently the old hero Echeneus, who was an excellent speaker and an elder among the Phaeacians, plainly and in all honesty addressed them thus:	ὣς εἰπὼν κατʼ ἄρʼ ἕζετʼ ἐπʼ ἐσχάρῃ ἐν κονίῃσιν πὰρ πυρί· οἱ δʼ ἄρα πάντες ἀκὴν ἐγένοντο σιωπῇ. ὀψὲ δὲ δὴ μετέειπε γέρων ἥρως Ἐχένηος, ὃς δὴ Φαιήκων ἀνδρῶν προγενέστερος ἦεν καὶ μύθοισι κέκαστο, παλαιά τε πολλά τε εἰδώς· ὅ σφιν ἐὺ φρονέων ἀγορήσατο καὶ μετέειπεν·
"""Alkinoos,"" said he, ""it is not creditable to you that a stranger should be seen sitting among the ashes of your hearth; every one is waiting to hear what you are about to say; tell him, then, to rise and take a seat on a stool inlaid with silver, and bid your servants mix some wine and water that we may make a drink-offering to Zeus the lord of thunder, who takes all well-disposed suppliants under his protection; and let the housekeeper give him some supper, of whatever there may be in the house."""	Ἀλκίνοʼ, οὐ μέν τοι τόδε κάλλιον, οὐδὲ ἔοικε, ξεῖνον μὲν χαμαὶ ἧσθαι ἐπʼ ἐσχάρῃ ἐν κονίῃσιν, οἵδε δὲ σὸν μῦθον ποτιδέγμενοι ἰσχανόωνται. ἄλλʼ ἄγε δὴ ξεῖνον μὲν ἐπὶ θρόνου ἀργυροήλου εἷσον ἀναστήσας, σὺ δὲ κηρύκεσσι κέλευσον οἶνον ἐπικρῆσαι, ἵνα καὶ Διὶ τερπικεραύνῳ σπείσομεν, ὅς θʼ ἱκέτῃσιν ἅμʼ αἰδοίοισιν ὀπηδεῖ· δόρπον δὲ ξείνῳ ταμίη δότω ἔνδον ἐόντων.
"When Alkinoos heard this he took Odysseus by the hand, raised him from the hearth, and bade him take the seat of Laodamas, who had been sitting beside him, and was his favorite son. A maid servant then brought him water in a beautiful golden ewer and poured it into a silver basin for him to wash his hands, and she drew a clean table beside him; an upper servant brought him bread and offered him many good things of what there was in the house, and Odysseus ate and drank. Then Alkinoos said to one of the servants, ""Pontonoos, mix a cup of wine and hand it round that we may make drink-offerings to Zeus the lord of thunder, who is the protector of all well-disposed suppliants."""	αὐτὰρ ἐπεὶ τό γʼ ἄκουσʼ ἱερὸν μένος Ἀλκινόοιο, χειρὸς ἑλὼν Ὀδυσῆα δαΐφρονα ποικιλομήτην ὦρσεν ἀπʼ ἐσχαρόφιν καὶ ἐπὶ θρόνου εἷσε φαεινοῦ, υἱὸν ἀναστήσας ἀγαπήνορα Λαοδάμαντα, ὅς οἱ πλησίον ἷζε, μάλιστα δέ μιν φιλέεσκεν. χέρνιβα δʼ ἀμφίπολος προχόῳ ἐπέχευε φέρουσα καλῇ χρυσείῃ ὑπὲρ ἀργυρέοιο λέβητος, νίψασθαι· παρὰ δὲ ξεστὴν ἐτάνυσσε τράπεζαν. σῖτον δʼ αἰδοίη ταμίη παρέθηκε φέρουσα, εἴδατα πόλλʼ ἐπιθεῖσα, χαριζομένη παρεόντων. αὐτὰρ ὁ πῖνε καὶ ἦσθε πολύτλας δῖος Ὀδυσσεύς. καὶ τότε κήρυκα προσέφη μένος Ἀλκινόοιο· Ποντόνοε, κρητῆρα κερασσάμενος μέθυ νεῖμον πᾶσιν ἀνὰ μέγαρον, ἵνα καὶ Διὶ τερπικεραύνῳ σπείσομεν, ὅς θʼ ἱκέτῃσιν ἅμʼ αἰδοίοισιν ὀπηδεῖ.
Pontonoos then mixed wine and water, and handed it round after giving every man his drink-offering. When they had made their offerings, and had drunk each as much as he was minded, Alkinoos said:	ὣς φάτο, Ποντόνοος δὲ μελίφρονα οἶνον ἐκίρνα, νώμησεν δʼ ἄρα πᾶσιν ἐπαρξάμενος δεπάεσσιν. αὐτὰρ ἐπεὶ σπεῖσάν τʼ ἔπιόν θʼ, ὅσον ἤθελε θυμός, τοῖσιν δʼ Ἀλκίνοος ἀγορήσατο καὶ μετέειπε·
"""Aldermen and town councilors of the Phaeacians, hear my words. You have had your supper, so now go home to bed. Tomorrow morning I shall invite a still larger number of aldermen, and will give a sacrificial banquet in honor of our guest; we can then discuss the question of his escort, and consider how we may at once send him back rejoicing to his own country without toil   or inconvenience to himself, no matter how distant it may be. We must see that he comes to no harm while on his homeward journey, but when he is once at home he will have to take the luck he was born with for better or worse like other people. It is possible, however, that the stranger is one of the immortals who has come down from heaven to visit us; but in this case the gods are departing from their usual practice, for hitherto they have made themselves perfectly clear to us when we have been offering them hecatombs. They come and sit at our feasts just like one of our selves, and if any solitary wayfarer happens to stumble upon some one or other of them, they affect no concealment, for we are as near of kin to the gods as the Cyclopes and the savage giants are."""	κέκλυτε, Φαιήκων ἡγήτορες ἠδὲ μέδοντες ὄφρʼ εἴπω τά με θυμὸς ἐνὶ στήθεσσι κελεύει. νῦν μὲν δαισάμενοι κατακείετε οἴκαδʼ ἰόντες· ἠῶθεν δὲ γέροντας ἐπὶ πλέονας καλέσαντες ξεῖνον ἐνὶ μεγάροις ξεινίσσομεν ἠδὲ θεοῖσιν ῥέξομεν ἱερὰ καλά, ἔπειτα δὲ καὶ περὶ πομπῆς μνησόμεθʼ, ὥς χʼ ὁ ξεῖνος ἄνευθε πόνου καὶ ἀνίης πομπῇ ὑφʼ ἡμετέρῃ ἣν πατρίδα γαῖαν ἵκηται χαίρων καρπαλίμως, εἰ καὶ μάλα τηλόθεν ἐστί, μηδέ τι μεσσηγύς γε κακὸν καὶ πῆμα πάθῃσι, πρίν γε τὸν ἧς γαίης ἐπιβήμεναι· ἔνθα δʼ ἔπειτα πείσεται, ἅσσα οἱ αἶσα κατὰ κλῶθές τε βαρεῖαι γιγνομένῳ νήσαντο λίνῳ, ὅτε μιν τέκε μήτηρ. εἰ δέ τις ἀθανάτων γε κατʼ οὐρανοῦ εἰλήλουθεν, ἄλλο τι δὴ τόδʼ ἔπειτα θεοὶ περιμηχανόωνται. αἰεὶ γὰρ τὸ πάρος γε θεοὶ φαίνονται ἐναργεῖς ἡμῖν, εὖτʼ ἔρδωμεν ἀγακλειτὰς ἑκατόμβας, δαίνυνταί τε παρʼ ἄμμι καθήμενοι ἔνθα περ ἡμεῖς. εἰ δʼ ἄρα τις καὶ μοῦνος ἰὼν ξύμβληται ὁδίτης, οὔ τι κατακρύπτουσιν, ἐπεί σφισιν ἐγγύθεν εἰμέν, ὥς περ Κύκλωπές τε καὶ ἄγρια φῦλα Γιγάντων.
"Then Odysseus said: ""Pray, Alkinoos, do not take any such notion into your head. I have nothing of the immortal about me, neither in body nor mind, and most resemble those among you who are the most afflicted. Indeed, were I to tell you all that heaven has seen fit to lay upon me, you would say that I was still worse off than they are. Nevertheless, let me sup in spite of sorrow, for an empty stomach is a very importunate thing, and thrusts itself on a man's notice no matter how dire is his distress  . I am in great distress  , yet it insists that I shall eat and drink, bids me lay aside all memory of my sorrows and dwell only on the due replenishing of itself. As for yourselves, do as you propose, and at break of day set about helping me to get home. I shall be content to die if I may first once more behold my property, my bondsmen, and all the greatness of my house."""	τὸν δʼ ἀπαμειβόμενος προσέφη πολύμητις Ὀδυσσεύς· Ἀλκίνοʼ, ἄλλο τί τοι μελέτω φρεσίν· οὐ γὰρ ἐγώ γε ἀθανάτοισιν ἔοικα, τοὶ οὐρανὸν εὐρὺν ἔχουσιν, οὐ δέμας οὐδὲ φυήν, ἀλλὰ θνητοῖσι βροτοῖσιν. οὕς τινας ὑμεῖς ἴστε μάλιστʼ ὀχέοντας ὀιζὺν ἀνθρώπων, τοῖσίν κεν ἐν ἄλγεσιν ἰσωσαίμην. καὶ δʼ ἔτι κεν καὶ μᾶλλον ἐγὼ κακὰ μυθησαίμην, ὅσσα γε δὴ ξύμπαντα θεῶν ἰότητι μόγησα. ἀλλʼ ἐμὲ μὲν δορπῆσαι ἐάσατε κηδόμενόν περ· οὐ γάρ τι στυγερῇ ἐπὶ γαστέρι κύντερον ἄλλο ἔπλετο, ἥ τʼ ἐκέλευσεν ἕο μνήσασθαι ἀνάγκῃ καὶ μάλα τειρόμενον καὶ ἐνὶ φρεσὶ πένθος ἔχοντα, ὡς καὶ ἐγὼ πένθος μὲν ἔχω φρεσίν, ἡ δὲ μάλʼ αἰεὶ ἐσθέμεναι κέλεται καὶ πινέμεν, ἐκ δέ με πάντων ληθάνει ὅσσʼ ἔπαθον, καὶ ἐνιπλησθῆναι ἀνώγει. ὑμεῖς δʼ ὀτρύνεσθαι ἅμʼ ἠοῖ φαινομένηφιν, ὥς κʼ ἐμὲ τὸν δύστηνον ἐμῆς ἐπιβήσετε πάτρης καί περ πολλὰ παθόντα· ἰδόντα με καὶ λίποι αἰὼν κτῆσιν ἐμήν, δμῶάς τε καὶ ὑψερεφὲς μέγα δῶμα.
"Thus did he speak. Every one approved his saying, and agreed that he should have his escort inasmuch as he had spoken reasonably. Then when they had made their drink-offerings, and had drunk each as much as he was minded they went home to bed every man in his own abode, leaving Odysseus in the room with Arete and Alkinoos while the servants were taking the things away after supper. Arete was the first to speak, for she recognized the shirt, cloak, and good clothes that Odysseus was wearing, as the work of herself and of her maids; so she said, ""Stranger, before we go any further, there is a question I should like to ask you. Who, and whence are you, and who gave you those clothes? Did you not say you had come here from beyond the sea?"""	ὣς ἔφαθʼ, οἱ δʼ ἄρα πάντες ἐπῄνεον ἠδʼ ἐκέλευον πεμπέμεναι τὸν ξεῖνον, ἐπεὶ κατὰ μοῖραν ἔειπεν. αὐτὰρ ἐπεὶ σπεῖσάν τʼ ἔπιον θʼ ὅσον ἤθελε θυμός, οἱ μὲν κακκείοντες ἔβαν οἶκόνδε ἕκαστος, αὐτὰρ ὁ ἐν μεγάρῳ ὑπελείπετο δῖος Ὀδυσσεύς, πὰρ δέ οἱ Ἀρήτη τε καὶ Ἀλκίνοος θεοειδὴς ἥσθην· ἀμφίπολοι δʼ ἀπεκόσμεον ἔντεα δαιτός. τοῖσιν δʼ Ἀρήτη λευκώλενος ἤρχετο μύθων· ἔγνω γὰρ φᾶρός τε χιτῶνά τε εἵματʼ ἰδοῦσα καλά, τά ῥʼ αὐτὴ τεῦξε σὺν ἀμφιπόλοισι γυναιξί· καί μιν φωνήσασʼ ἔπεα πτερόεντα προσηύδα· ξεῖνε, τὸ μέν σε πρῶτον ἐγὼν εἰρήσομαι αὐτή· τίς πόθεν εἰς ἀνδρῶν; τίς τοι τάδε εἵματʼ ἔδωκεν; οὐ δὴ φῆς ἐπὶ πόντον ἀλώμενος ἐνθάδʼ ἱκέσθαι;
"And Odysseus answered, ""It would be a long story, Lady, were I to relate in full the tale of my misfortunes, for the hand of heaven has been laid heavy upon me; but as regards your question, there is an island far away in the sea which is called ‘the Ogygian.’ Here dwells the cunning and powerful goddess Calypso, daughter of Atlas. She lives by herself far from all neighbors human or divine. A , however, led me to her hearth all desolate and alone, for Zeus struck my ship with his thunderbolts, and broke it up in mid-ocean. My brave comrades were drowned every man of them, but I stuck to the keel and was carried hither and thither for the space of nine days, till at last during the darkness of the tenth night the gods brought me to the Ogygian island where the great goddess Calypso lives. She took me in and treated me with the utmost kindness; indeed she wanted to make me immortal that I might never grow old, but she could not persuade me to let her do so."	τὴν δʼ ἀπαμειβόμενος προσέφη πολύμητις Ὀδυσσεύς· ἀργαλέον, βασίλεια, διηνεκέως ἀγορεῦσαι κήδεʼ, ἐπεί μοι πολλὰ δόσαν θεοὶ Οὐρανίωνες· τοῦτο δέ τοι ἐρέω ὅ μʼ ἀνείρεαι ἠδὲ μεταλλᾷς.

"""I stayed with Calypso seven years straight on end, and watered the good clothes she gave me with my tears during the whole time; but at last when the eighth year came round she bade me depart of her own free will, either because Zeus had told her she must, or because she had changed her mind  . She sent me from her island on a raft, which she provisioned with abundance of bread and wine. Moreover she gave me good stout clothing, and sent me a wind that blew both warm and fair. Seventeen days did I sail over the sea, and on the eighteenth I caught sight of the first outlines of the mountains upon your coast - and glad indeed was I to set eyes upon them. Nevertheless there was still much trouble in store for me, for at this point Poseidon would let me go no further, and raised a great storm against me; the sea was so terribly high that I could no longer keep to my raft, which went to pieces under the fury of the gale, and I had to swim for it, till wind and current brought me to your shores."	ἔνθα μὲν ἑπτάετες μένον ἔμπεδον, εἵματα δʼ αἰεὶ δάκρυσι δεύεσκον, τά μοι ἄμβροτα δῶκε Καλυψώ· ἀλλʼ ὅτε δὴ ὀγδόατόν μοι ἐπιπλόμενον ἔτος ἦλθεν, καὶ τότε δή μʼ ἐκέλευσεν ἐποτρύνουσα νέεσθαι Ζηνὸς ὑπʼ ἀγγελίης, ἢ καὶ νόος ἐτράπετʼ αὐτῆς. πέμπε δʼ ἐπὶ σχεδίης πολυδέσμου, πολλὰ δʼ ἔδωκε, σῖτον καὶ μέθυ ἡδύ, καὶ ἄμβροτα εἵματα ἕσσεν, οὖρον δὲ προέηκεν ἀπήμονά τε λιαρόν τε. ἑπτὰ δὲ καὶ δέκα μὲν πλέον ἤματα ποντοπορεύων, ὀκτωκαιδεκάτῃ δʼ ἐφάνη ὄρεα σκιόεντα γαίης ὑμετέρης, γήθησε δέ μοι φίλον ἦτορ δυσμόρῳ· ἦ γὰρ ἔμελλον ἔτι ξυνέσεσθαι ὀιζυῖ πολλῇ, τήν μοι ἐπῶρσε Ποσειδάων ἐνοσίχθων, ὅς μοι ἐφορμήσας ἀνέμους κατέδησε κέλευθον, ὤρινεν δὲ θάλασσαν ἀθέσφατον, οὐδέ τι κῦμα εἴα ἐπὶ σχεδίης ἁδινὰ στενάχοντα φέρεσθαι. τὴν μὲν ἔπειτα θύελλα διεσκέδασʼ· αὐτὰρ ἐγώ γε νηχόμενος τόδε λαῖτμα διέτμαγον, ὄφρα με γαίῃ ὑμετέρῃ ἐπέλασσε φέρων ἄνεμός τε καὶ ὕδωρ.
"""There I tried to land, but could not, for it was a bad place and the waves dashed me against the rocks, so I again took to the sea and swam on till I came to a river that seemed the most likely landing place, for there were no rocks and it was sheltered from the wind. Here, then, I got out of the water and gathered my senses together again. Night was coming on, so I left the river, and went into a thicket, where I covered myself all over with leaves, and presently heaven sent me off into a very deep sleep. Sick and sorry as I was I slept among the leaves all night, and through the next day till afternoon, when I woke as the sun was westering, and saw your daughter's maid servants playing upon the beach, and your daughter among them looking like a goddess. I besought her aid, and she proved to be of an excellent disposition, much more so than could be expected from so young a person - for young people are apt to be thoughtless. She gave me plenty of bread and wine, and when she had had me washed in the river she also gave me the clothes in which you see me. Now, therefore, though it has pained me to do so, I have told you the whole truth  ."""	ἔνθα κέ μʼ ἐκβαίνοντα βιήσατο κῦμʼ ἐπὶ χέρσου, πέτρῃς πρὸς μεγάλῃσι βαλὸν καὶ ἀτερπέι χώρῳ· ἀλλʼ ἀναχασσάμενος νῆχον πάλιν, ἧος ἐπῆλθον ἐς ποταμόν, τῇ δή μοι ἐείσατο χῶρος ἄριστος, λεῖος πετράων, καὶ ἐπὶ σκέπας ἦν ἀνέμοιο. ἐκ δʼ ἔπεσον θυμηγερέων, ἐπὶ δʼ ἀμβροσίη νὺξ ἤλυθʼ. ἐγὼ δʼ ἀπάνευθε διιπετέος ποταμοῖο ἐκβὰς ἐν θάμνοισι κατέδραθον, ἀμφὶ δὲ φύλλα ἠφυσάμην· ὕπνον δὲ θεὸς κατʼ ἀπείρονα χεῦεν. ἔνθα μὲν ἐν φύλλοισι φίλον τετιημένος ἦτορ εὗδον παννύχιος καὶ ἐπʼ ἠῶ καὶ μέσον ἦμαρ. δείλετό τʼ ἠέλιος καί με γλυκὺς ὕπνος ἀνῆκεν. ἀμφιπόλους δʼ ἐπὶ θινὶ τεῆς ἐνόησα θυγατρὸς παιζούσας, ἐν δʼ αὐτὴ ἔην ἐικυῖα θεῇσι· τὴν ἱκέτευσʼ· ἡ δʼ οὔ τι νοήματος ἤμβροτεν ἐσθλοῦ, ὡς οὐκ ἂν ἔλποιο νεώτερον ἀντιάσαντα ἐρξέμεν· αἰεὶ γάρ τε νεώτεροι ἀφραδέουσιν. ἥ μοι σῖτον ἔδωκεν ἅλις ἠδʼ αἴθοπα οἶνον καὶ λοῦσʼ ἐν ποταμῷ καί μοι τάδε εἵματʼ ἔδωκε. ταῦτά τοι ἀχνύμενός περ ἀληθείην κατέλεξα.
"Then Alkinoos said, ""Stranger, it was very wrong of my daughter not to bring you on at once to my house along with the maids, seeing that she was the first person whose aid you asked."""	τὸν δʼ αὖτʼ Ἀλκίνοος ἀπαμείβετο φώνησέν τε· ξεῖνʼ, ἦ τοι μὲν τοῦτο γʼ ἐναίσιμον οὐκ ἐνόησε παῖς ἐμή, οὕνεκά σʼ οὔ τι μετʼ ἀμφιπόλοισι γυναιξὶν ἦγεν ἐς ἡμέτερον, σὺ δʼ ἄρα πρώτην ἱκέτευσας.
"""Pray do not scold her,"" replied Odysseus; ""she is not to blame. She did tell me to follow along with the maids, but I was ashamed and afraid, for I thought you might perhaps be displeased if you saw me. Every human being is sometimes a little suspicious and irritable."""	τὸν δʼ ἀπαμειβόμενος προσέφη πολύμητις Ὀδυσσεύς· ἥρως, μή τοι τοὔνεκʼ ἀμύμονα νείκεε κούρην· ἡ μὲν γάρ μʼ ἐκέλευε σὺν ἀμφιπόλοισιν ἕπεσθαι, ἀλλʼ ἐγὼ οὐκ ἔθελον δείσας αἰσχυνόμενός τε, μή πως καὶ σοὶ θυμὸς ἐπισκύσσαιτο ἰδόντι· δύσζηλοι γάρ τʼ εἰμὲν ἐπὶ χθονὶ φῦλʼ ἀνθρώπων.
"""Stranger,"" replied Alkinoos, ""I am not the kind of man to get angry about nothing; it is always better to be reasonable; but by Father Zeus, Athena, and Apollo, now that I see what kind of person you are, and how much you think as I do, I wish you would stay here, marry my daughter, and become my son-in-law. If you will stay I will give you a house and an estate, but no one (heaven forbid) shall keep you here against your own wish, and that you may be sure of this I will attend tomorrow to the matter of your escort. You can sleep during the whole voyage if you like, and the men shall sail you over smooth waters either to your own home, or wherever you please, even though it be a long way further off than Euboea , which those of my people who saw it when they took yellow-haired Rhadamanthus to see Tityus the son of Gaia, tell me is the furthest of any place - and yet they did the whole voyage in a single day without distressing themselves, and came back again afterwards. You will thus see how much my ships excel all others, and what magnificent oarsmen my sailors are."""	τὸν δʼ αὖτʼ Ἀλκίνοος ἀπαμείβετο φώνησέν τε· ξεῖνʼ, οὔ μοι τοιοῦτον ἐνὶ στήθεσσι φίλον κῆρ μαψιδίως κεχολῶσθαι· ἀμείνω δʼ αἴσιμα πάντα. αἲ γάρ, Ζεῦ τε πάτερ καὶ Ἀθηναίη καὶ Ἄπολλον, τοῖος ἐὼν οἷός ἐσσι, τά τε φρονέων ἅ τʼ ἐγώ περ, παῖδά τʼ ἐμὴν ἐχέμεν καὶ ἐμὸς γαμβρὸς καλέεσθαι αὖθι μένων· οἶκον δέ κʼ ἐγὼ καὶ κτήματα δοίην, εἴ κʼ ἐθέλων γε μένοις· ἀέκοντα δέ σʼ οὔ τις ἐρύξει Φαιήκων· μὴ τοῦτο φίλον Διὶ πατρὶ γένοιτο. πομπὴν δʼ ἐς τόδʼ ἐγὼ τεκμαίρομαι, ὄφρʼ ἐὺ εἰδῇς, αὔριον ἔς· τῆμος δὲ σὺ μὲν δεδμημένος ὕπνῳ λέξεαι, οἱ δʼ ἐλόωσι γαλήνην, ὄφρʼ ἂν ἵκηαι πατρίδα σὴν καὶ δῶμα, καὶ εἴ πού τοι φίλον ἐστίν, εἴ περ καὶ μάλα πολλὸν ἑκαστέρω ἔστʼ Εὐβοίης, τήν περ τηλοτάτω φάσʼ ἔμμεναι, οἵ μιν ἴδοντο λαῶν ἡμετέρων, ὅτε τε ξανθὸν Ῥαδάμανθυν ἦγον ἐποψόμενον Τιτυὸν Γαιήιον υἱόν. καὶ μὲν οἱ ἔνθʼ ἦλθον καὶ ἄτερ καμάτοιο τέλεσσαν ἤματι τῷ αὐτῷ καὶ ἀπήνυσαν οἴκαδʼ ὀπίσσω. εἰδήσεις δὲ καὶ αὐτὸς ἐνὶ φρεσὶν ὅσσον ἄρισται νῆες ἐμαὶ καὶ κοῦροι ἀναρρίπτειν ἅλα πηδῷ.
"Then was Odysseus glad and prayed aloud saying, ""Father Zeus, grant that Alkinoos may do all as he has said, for so he will win an imperishable among humankind, and at the same time I shall return to my country."""	ὣς φάτο, γήθησεν δὲ πολύτλας δῖος Ὀδυσσεύς, εὐχόμενος δʼ ἄρα εἶπεν, ἔπος τʼ ἔφατʼ ἔκ τʼ ὀνόμαζεν· Ζεῦ πάτερ, αἴθʼ ὅσα εἶπε τελευτήσειεν ἅπαντα Ἀλκίνοος· τοῦ μέν κεν ἐπὶ ζείδωρον ἄρουραν ἄσβεστον κλέος εἴη, ἐγὼ δέ κε πατρίδʼ ἱκοίμην.
"Thus did they converse. Then Arete told her maids to set a bed in the room that was in the gatehouse, and make it with good red rugs, and to spread coverlets on the top of them with woolen cloaks for Odysseus to wear. The maids thereon went out with torches in their hands, and when they had made the bed they came up to Odysseus and said, ""Rise, sir stranger, and come with us for your bed is ready,"" and glad indeed was he to go to his rest."	ὣς οἱ μὲν τοιαῦτα πρὸς ἀλλήλους ἀγόρευον· κέκλετο δʼ Ἀρήτη λευκώλενος ἀμφιπόλοισιν δέμνιʼ ὑπʼ αἰθούσῃ θέμεναι καὶ ῥήγεα καλὰ πορφύρεʼ ἐμβαλέειν, στορέσαι τʼ ἐφύπερθε τάπητας χλαίνας τʼ ἐνθέμεναι οὔλας καθύπερθεν ἕσασθαι. αἱ δʼ ἴσαν ἐκ μεγάροιο δάος μετὰ χερσὶν ἔχουσαι· αὐτὰρ ἐπεὶ στόρεσαν πυκινὸν λέχος ἐγκονέουσαι, ὤτρυνον δʼ Ὀδυσῆα παριστάμεναι ἐπέεσσιν· ὄρσο κέων, ὦ ξεῖνε· πεποίηται δέ τοι εὐνή. ὣς φάν, τῷ δʼ ἀσπαστὸν ἐείσατο κοιμηθῆναι.
So Odysseus slept in a bed placed in a room over the echoing gateway; but Alkinoos lay in the inner part of the house, with the queen his wife by his side.	ὣς ὁ μὲν ἔνθα καθεῦδε πολύτλας δῖος Ὀδυσσεὺς τρητοῖς ἐν λεχέεσσιν ὑπʼ αἰθούσῃ ἐριδούπῳ· Ἀλκίνοος δʼ ἄρα λέκτο μυχῷ δόμου ὑψηλοῖο,
"Now when the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared, Alkinoos and Odysseus both rose, and Alkinoos led the way to the Phaeacian place of assembly, which was near the ships. When they got there they sat down side by side on a seat of polished stone, while Athena took the form of one of Alkinoos’ servants, and went round the town in order to contrive for great-hearted Odysseus. She went up to the citizens, man by man, and said, ""Aldermen and town councilors of the Phaeacians, come to the assembly all of you and listen to the stranger who has just come off a long voyage to the house of King Alkinoos; he looks like an immortal god."""	ἦμος δʼ ἠριγένεια φάνη ῥοδοδάκτυλος Ἠώς, ὤρνυτʼ ἄρʼ ἐξ εὐνῆς ἱερὸν μένος Ἀλκινόοιο, ἂν δʼ ἄρα διογενὴς ὦρτο πτολίπορθος Ὀδυσσεύς. τοῖσιν δʼ ἡγεμόνευʼ ἱερὸν μένος Ἀλκινόοιο Φαιήκων ἀγορήνδʼ, ἥ σφιν παρὰ νηυσὶ τέτυκτο. ἐλθόντες δὲ καθῖζον ἐπὶ ξεστοῖσι λίθοισι πλησίον. ἡ δʼ ἀνὰ ἄστυ μετῴχετο Παλλὰς Ἀθήνη εἰδομένη κήρυκι δαΐφρονος Ἀλκινόοιο, νόστον Ὀδυσσῆι μεγαλήτορι μητιόωσα, καί ῥα ἑκάστῳ φωτὶ παρισταμένη φάτο μῦθον· δεῦτʼ ἄγε, Φαιήκων ἡγήτορες ἠδὲ μέδοντες, εἰς ἀγορὴν ἰέναι, ὄφρα ξείνοιο πύθησθε, ὃς νέον Ἀλκινόοιο δαΐφρονος ἵκετο δῶμα πόντον ἐπιπλαγχθείς, δέμας ἀθανάτοισιν ὁμοῖος.
With these words she made them all want to come, and they flocked to the assembly till seats and standing room were alike crowded. Every one was struck with the appearance of Odysseus, for Athena had beautified   him about the head and shoulders, making him look taller and stouter than he really was, that he might impress the Phaeacians favorably as being a very remarkable man, and might come off well in the many trials   of skill to which they would challenge him. Then, when they were got together, Alkinoos spoke:	ὣς εἰποῦσʼ ὤτρυνε μένος καὶ θυμὸν ἑκάστου. καρπαλίμως δʼ ἔμπληντο βροτῶν ἀγοραί τε καὶ ἕδραι ἀγρομένων· πολλοὶ δʼ ἄρʼ ἐθηήσαντο ἰδόντες υἱὸν Λαέρταο δαΐφρονα· τῷ δʼ ἄρʼ Ἀθήνη θεσπεσίην κατέχευε χάριν κεφαλῇ τε καὶ ὤμοις καί μιν μακρότερον καὶ πάσσονα θῆκεν ἰδέσθαι, ὥς κεν Φαιήκεσσι φίλος πάντεσσι γένοιτο δεινός τʼ αἰδοῖός τε καὶ ἐκτελέσειεν ἀέθλους πολλούς, τοὺς Φαίηκες ἐπειρήσαντʼ Ὀδυσῆος. αὐτὰρ ἐπεί ῥʼ ἤγερθεν ὁμηγερέες τʼ ἐγένοντο, τοῖσιν δʼ Ἀλκίνοος ἀγορήσατο καὶ μετέειπε·
"""Hear me,"" said he, ""aldermen and town councilors of the Phaeacians, that I may speak even as I am minded. This stranger, whoever he may be, has found his way to my house from somewhere or other either East or West. He wants an escort and wishes to have the matter settled. Let us then get one ready for him, as we have done for others before him; indeed, no one who ever yet came to my house has been able to complain of me for not speeding on his way soon enough. Let us draw a ship into the sea - one that has never yet made a voyage - and man her with two and fifty of our choicest   young sailors in the Then when you have made fast your oars each by his own seat, leave the ship and come to my house to prepare a feast. I will provide you with everything. I am giving these instructions to the young men who will form the crew, for as regards you aldermen and town councilors, you will join me in entertaining our guest in the cloisters. I can take no excuses, and we will have Demodokos to sing to us; for there is no bard like him whatever he may choose to sing about."""	κέκλυτε, Φαιήκων ἡγήτορες ἠδὲ μέδοντες, ὄφρʼ εἴπω τά με θυμὸς ἐνὶ στήθεσσι κελεύει. ξεῖνος ὅδʼ, οὐκ οἶδʼ ὅς τις, ἀλώμενος ἵκετʼ ἐμὸν δῶ, ἠὲ πρὸς ἠοίων ἦ ἑσπερίων ἀνθρώπων· πομπὴν δʼ ὀτρύνει, καὶ λίσσεται ἔμπεδον εἶναι. ἡμεῖς δʼ, ὡς τὸ πάρος περ, ἐποτρυνώμεθα πομπήν. οὐδὲ γὰρ οὐδέ τις ἄλλος, ὅτις κʼ ἐμὰ δώμαθʼ ἵκηται, ἐνθάδʼ ὀδυρόμενος δηρὸν μένει εἵνεκα πομπῆς. ἀλλʼ ἄγε νῆα μέλαιναν ἐρύσσομεν εἰς ἅλα δῖαν πρωτόπλοον, κούρω δὲ δύω καὶ πεντήκοντα κρινάσθων κατὰ δῆμον, ὅσοι πάρος εἰσὶν ἄριστοι. δησάμενοι δʼ ἐὺ πάντες ἐπὶ κληῖσιν ἐρετμὰ ἔκβητʼ· αὐτὰρ ἔπειτα θοὴν ἀλεγύνετε δαῖτα ἡμέτερόνδʼ ἐλθόντες· ἐγὼ δʼ ἐὺ πᾶσι παρέξω. κούροισιν μὲν ταῦτʼ ἐπιτέλλομαι· αὐτὰρ οἱ ἄλλοι σκηπτοῦχοι βασιλῆες ἐμὰ πρὸς δώματα καλὰ ἔρχεσθʼ, ὄφρα ξεῖνον ἐνὶ μεγάροισι φιλέωμεν, μηδέ τις ἀρνείσθω. καλέσασθε δὲ θεῖον ἀοιδὸν Δημόδοκον· τῷ γάρ ῥα θεὸς πέρι δῶκεν ἀοιδὴν τέρπειν, ὅππῃ θυμὸς ἐποτρύνῃσιν ἀείδειν.
Alkinoos then led the way, and the others followed after, while a servant went to fetch Demodokos. The fifty-two picked   oarsmen went to the sea shore as they had been told, and when they got there they drew the ship into the water, got her mast and sails inside her, bound the oars to the thole-pins with twisted thongs of leather, all in due course, and spread the white sails aloft. They moored the vessel a little way out from land, and then came on shore and went to the house of King Alkinoos. The outhouses, yards, and all the precincts were filled with crowds of men in great multitudes both old and young; and Alkinoos killed them a dozen sheep, eight full grown pigs, and two oxen. These they skinned and dressed so as to provide a magnificent banquet.	ὣς ἄρα φωνήσας ἡγήσατο, τοὶ δʼ ἅμʼ ἕποντο σκηπτοῦχοι· κῆρυξ δὲ μετῴχετο θεῖον ἀοιδόν. κούρω δὲ κρινθέντε δύω καὶ πεντήκοντα βήτην, ὡς ἐκέλευσʼ, ἐπὶ θῖνʼ ἁλὸς ἀτρυγέτοιο. αὐτὰρ ἐπεί ῥʼ ἐπὶ νῆα κατήλυθον ἠδὲ θάλασσαν, νῆα μὲν οἵ γε μέλαιναν ἁλὸς βένθοσδε ἔρυσσαν, ἐν δʼ ἱστόν τʼ ἐτίθεντο καὶ ἱστία νηὶ μελαίνῃ, ἠρτύναντο δʼ ἐρετμὰ τροποῖς ἐν δερματίνοισι, πάντα κατὰ μοῖραν, ἀνά θʼ ἱστία λευκὰ πέτασσαν. ὑψοῦ δʼ ἐν νοτίῳ τήν γʼ ὥρμισαν· αὐτὰρ ἔπειτα βάν ῥʼ ἴμεν Ἀλκινόοιο δαΐφρονος ἐς μέγα δῶμα. πλῆντο δʼ ἄρʼ αἴθουσαί τε καὶ ἕρκεα καὶ δόμοι ἀνδρῶν ἀγρομένων· πολλοὶ δʼ ἄρʼ ἔσαν, νέοι ἠδὲ παλαιοί. τοῖσιν δʼ Ἀλκίνοος δυοκαίδεκα μῆλʼ ἱέρευσεν, ὀκτὼ δʼ ἀργιόδοντας ὕας, δύο δʼ εἰλίποδας βοῦς· τοὺς δέρον ἀμφί θʼ ἕπον, τετύκοντό τε δαῖτʼ ἐρατεινήν.
A servant presently led in the famous bard Demodokos, whom the muse had dearly loved, but to whom she had given both good and evil, for though she had endowed him with a divine gift of song, she had robbed him of his eyesight. Pontonoos set a seat for him among the guests, leaning it up against a bearing-post. He hung the lyre for him on a peg over his head, and showed him where he was to feel for it with his hands. He also set a fair table with a basket of victuals by his side, and a cup of wine from which he might drink whenever he was so disposed.	κῆρυξ δʼ ἐγγύθεν ἦλθεν ἄγων ἐρίηρον ἀοιδόν, τὸν πέρι μοῦσʼ ἐφίλησε, δίδου δʼ ἀγαθόν τε κακόν τε· ὀφθαλμῶν μὲν ἄμερσε, δίδου δʼ ἡδεῖαν ἀοιδήν. τῷ δʼ ἄρα Ποντόνοος θῆκε θρόνον ἀργυρόηλον μέσσῳ δαιτυμόνων, πρὸς κίονα μακρὸν ἐρείσας· κὰδ δʼ ἐκ πασσαλόφι κρέμασεν φόρμιγγα λίγειαν αὐτοῦ ὑπὲρ κεφαλῆς καὶ ἐπέφραδε χερσὶν ἑλέσθαι κῆρυξ· πὰρ δʼ ἐτίθει κάνεον καλήν τε τράπεζαν, πὰρ δὲ δέπας οἴνοιο, πιεῖν ὅτε θυμὸς ἀνώγοι.
The company then laid their hands upon the good things that were before them, but as soon as they had had enough to eat and drink, the muse inspired Demodokos to sing the feats   of heroes, and most especially a matter whose at that time reached wide heaven, to wit, the quarrel   between Odysseus and Achilles, and the fierce words that they heaped on one another as they sat together at a banquet. But Agamemnon was glad in his when he heard his chieftains quarreling with one another, for Apollo had foretold him this at Pytho when he crossed the stone floor to consult the oracle. Here the beginning of the evil started rolling down, by the will of Zeus, toward both Danaans and Trojans.	οἱ δʼ ἐπʼ ὀνείαθʼ ἑτοῖμα προκείμενα χεῖρας ἴαλλον. αὐτὰρ ἐπεὶ πόσιος καὶ ἐδητύος ἐξ ἔρον ἕντο, μοῦσʼ ἄρʼ ἀοιδὸν ἀνῆκεν ἀειδέμεναι κλέα ἀνδρῶν, οἴμης τῆς τότʼ ἄρα κλέος οὐρανὸν εὐρὺν ἵκανε, νεῖκος Ὀδυσσῆος καὶ Πηλεΐδεω Ἀχιλῆος, ὥς ποτε δηρίσαντο θεῶν ἐν δαιτὶ θαλείῃ ἐκπάγλοις ἐπέεσσιν, ἄναξ δʼ ἀνδρῶν Ἀγαμέμνων χαῖρε νόῳ, ὅ τʼ ἄριστοι Ἀχαιῶν δηριόωντο. ὣς γάρ οἱ χρείων μυθήσατο Φοῖβος Ἀπόλλων Πυθοῖ ἐν ἠγαθέῃ, ὅθʼ ὑπέρβη λάινον οὐδὸν χρησόμενος· τότε γάρ ῥα κυλίνδετο πήματος ἀρχὴ Τρωσί τε καὶ Δαναοῖσι Διὸς μεγάλου διὰ βουλάς.
"Thus sang the bard, but Odysseus drew his purple mantle over his head and covered his face, for he was ashamed to let the Phaeacians see that he was weeping. When the bard left off singing he wiped the tears from his eyes, uncovered his face, and, taking his cup, made a drink-offering to the gods; but when the Phaeacians pressed Demodokos to sing further, for they delighted in his lays, then Odysseus again drew his mantle over his head and wept bitterly. No one noticed his distress except Alkinoos, who was sitting near him, and heard the heavy sighs that he was heaving. So he at once said, ""Aldermen and town councilors of the Phaeacians, we have had enough now, both of the feast, and of the minstrelsy that is its due accompaniment; let us proceed therefore to the athletic sports  , so that our guest on his return home may be able to tell his friends how much we surpass all other nations as boxers, wrestlers, jumpers, and runners."""	ταῦτʼ ἄρʼ ἀοιδὸς ἄειδε περικλυτός· αὐτὰρ Ὀδυσσεὺς πορφύρεον μέγα φᾶρος ἑλὼν χερσὶ στιβαρῇσι κὰκ κεφαλῆς εἴρυσσε, κάλυψε δὲ καλὰ πρόσωπα· αἴδετο γὰρ Φαίηκας ὑπʼ ὀφρύσι δάκρυα λείβων. ἦ τοι ὅτε λήξειεν ἀείδων θεῖος ἀοιδός, δάκρυ ὀμορξάμενος κεφαλῆς ἄπο φᾶρος ἕλεσκε καὶ δέπας ἀμφικύπελλον ἑλὼν σπείσασκε θεοῖσιν· αὐτὰρ ὅτʼ ἂψ ἄρχοιτο καὶ ὀτρύνειαν ἀείδειν Φαιήκων οἱ ἄριστοι, ἐπεὶ τέρποντʼ ἐπέεσσιν, ἂψ Ὀδυσεὺς κατὰ κρᾶτα καλυψάμενος γοάασκεν. ἔνθʼ ἄλλους μὲν πάντας ἐλάνθανε δάκρυα λείβων, Ἀλκίνοος δέ μιν οἶος ἐπεφράσατʼ ἠδʼ ἐνόησεν ἥμενος ἄγχʼ αὐτοῦ, βαρὺ δὲ στενάχοντος ἄκουσεν. αἶψα δὲ Φαιήκεσσι φιληρέτμοισι μετηύδα· κέκλυτε, Φαιήκων ἡγήτορες ἠδὲ μέδοντες. ἤδη μὲν δαιτὸς κεκορήμεθα θυμὸν ἐίσης φόρμιγγός θʼ, ἣ δαιτὶ συνήορός ἐστι θαλείῃ· νῦν δʼ ἐξέλθωμεν καὶ ἀέθλων πειρηθῶμεν πάντων, ὥς χʼ ὁ ξεῖνος ἐνίσπῃ οἷσι φίλοισιν οἴκαδε νοστήσας, ὅσσον περιγιγνόμεθʼ ἄλλων πύξ τε παλαιμοσύνῃ τε καὶ ἅλμασιν ἠδὲ πόδεσσιν.
With these words he led the way, and the others followed after. A servant hung Demodokos’ lyre on its peg for him, led him out of the room, and set him on the same way as that along which all the chief men of the Phaeacians were going to see the sports; a crowd of several thousand people followed them, and there were many excellent competitors for all the prizes. Akroneos, Okyalos, Elatreus, Nauteus, Prymneus, Anchialos, Eretmeus, Ponteus, Proreus, Thoon, Anabesineos, and Amphialos son of Polyneos son of Tekton. There was also Euryalos son of Naubolos, who was like Ares himself, and was the best looking man among the Phaeacians except Laodamas. Three sons of Alkinoos, Laodamas, Halios, and Clytoneus, competed also.	ὣς ἄρα φωνήσας ἡγήσατο, τοὶ δʼ ἅμʼ ἕποντο. κὰδ δʼ ἐκ πασσαλόφι κρέμασεν φόρμιγγα λίγειαν, Δημοδόκου δʼ ἕλε χεῖρα καὶ ἔξαγεν ἐκ μεγάροιο κῆρυξ· ἦρχε δὲ τῷ αὐτὴν ὁδὸν ἥν περ οἱ ἄλλοι Φαιήκων οἱ ἄριστοι, ἀέθλια θαυμανέοντες. βὰν δʼ ἴμεν εἰς ἀγορήν, ἅμα δʼ ἕσπετο πουλὺς ὅμιλος, μυρίοι· ἂν δʼ ἵσταντο νέοι πολλοί τε καὶ ἐσθλοί. ὦρτο μὲν Ἀκρόνεώς τε καὶ Ὠκύαλος καὶ Ἐλατρεύς, Ναυτεύς τε Πρυμνεύς τε καὶ Ἀγχίαλος καὶ Ἐρετμεύς, Ποντεύς τε Πρωρεύς τε, Θόων Ἀναβησίνεώς τε Ἀμφίαλός θʼ, υἱὸς Πολυνήου Τεκτονίδαο· ἂν δὲ καὶ Εὐρύαλος, βροτολοιγῷ ἶσος Ἄρηϊ, Ναυβολίδης, ὃς ἄριστος ἔην εἶδός τε δέμας τε πάντων Φαιήκων μετʼ ἀμύμονα Λαοδάμαντα. ἂν δʼ ἔσταν τρεῖς παῖδες ἀμύμονος Ἀλκινόοιο, Λαοδάμας θʼ Ἅλιός τε καὶ ἀντίθεος Κλυτόνηος.
"The foot races came first. The course was set out for them from the starting post, and they raised a dust upon the plain as they all flew forward at the same moment. Clytoneus came in first by a long way; he left every one else behind him by the length of the furrow that a couple of mules can plough in a fallow field. They then turned to the painful art of wrestling, and here Euryalos proved to be the best man. Amphialos excelled all the others in jumping, while at throwing the disc there was no one who could approach Elatreus. Alkinoos’ son Laodamas was the best boxer, and he it was who presently said, when they had all been diverted with the games  , ""Let us ask the stranger whether he excels in any of these sports  ; he seems very powerfully built; his thighs, calves, hands, and neck are of prodigious strength, nor is he at all old, but he has suffered much lately, and there is nothing like the sea for making havoc with a man, no matter how strong he is."""	οἱ δʼ ἦ τοι πρῶτον μὲν ἐπειρήσαντο πόδεσσι. τοῖσι δʼ ἀπὸ νύσσης τέτατο δρόμος· οἱ δʼ ἅμα πάντες καρπαλίμως ἐπέτοντο κονίοντες πεδίοιο· τῶν δὲ θέειν ὄχʼ ἄριστος ἔην Κλυτόνηος ἀμύμων· ὅσσον τʼ ἐν νειῷ οὖρον πέλει ἡμιόνοιιν, τόσσον ὑπεκπροθέων λαοὺς ἵκεθʼ, οἱ δʼ ἐλίποντο. οἱ δὲ παλαιμοσύνης ἀλεγεινῆς πειρήσαντο· τῇ δʼ αὖτʼ Εὐρύαλος ἀπεκαίνυτο πάντας ἀρίστους. ἅλματι δʼ Ἀμφίαλος πάντων προφερέστατος ἦεν· δίσκῳ δʼ αὖ πάντων πολὺ φέρτατος ἦεν Ἐλατρεύς, πὺξ δʼ αὖ Λαοδάμας, ἀγαθὸς πάϊς Ἀλκινόοιο. αὐτὰρ ἐπεὶ δὴ πάντες ἐτέρφθησαν φρένʼ ἀέθλοις, τοῖς ἄρα Λαοδάμας μετέφη πάϊς Ἀλκινόοιο· δεῦτε, φίλοι, τὸν ξεῖνον ἐρώμεθα εἴ τινʼ ἄεθλον οἶδέ τε καὶ δεδάηκε. φυήν γε μὲν οὐ κακός ἐστι, μηρούς τε κνήμας τε καὶ ἄμφω χεῖρας ὕπερθεν αὐχένα τε στιβαρὸν μέγα τε σθένος· οὐδέ τι ἥβης δεύεται, ἀλλὰ κακοῖσι συνέρρηκται πολέεσσιν· οὐ γὰρ ἐγώ γέ τί φημι κακώτερον ἄλλο θαλάσσης ἄνδρα γε συγχεῦαι, εἰ καὶ μάλα καρτερὸς εἴη.
"""You are quite right, Laodamas,"" replied Euryalos, ""go up to your guest and speak to him about it yourself."""	τὸν δʼ αὖτʼ Εὐρύαλος ἀπαμείβετο φώνησέν τε· Λαοδάμα, μάλα τοῦτο ἔπος κατὰ μοῖραν ἔειπες. αὐτὸς νῦν προκάλεσσαι ἰὼν καὶ πέφραδε μῦθον.
"When Laodamas heard this he made his way into the middle of the crowd and said to Odysseus, ""I hope, sir, that you will enter yourself in some one or other of our competitions   if you are skilled in any of them - for you seem to know of . There is no greater for a man all his life long as the showing himself good with his hands and feet. Have a try therefore at something, and banish all sorrow from your mind. Your return home will not be long delayed, for the ship is already drawn into the water, and the crew is found."""	αὐτὰρ ἐπεὶ τό γʼ ἄκουσʼ ἀγαθὸς πάϊς Ἀλκινόοιο, στῆ ῥʼ ἐς μέσσον ἰὼν καὶ Ὀδυσσῆα προσέειπε· δεῦρʼ ἄγε καὶ σύ, ξεῖνε πάτερ, πείρησαι ἀέθλων, εἴ τινά που δεδάηκας· ἔοικε δέ σʼ ἴδμεν ἀέθλους· οὐ μὲν γὰρ μεῖζον κλέος ἀνέρος ὄφρα κʼ ἔῃσιν, ἤ ὅ τι ποσσίν τε ῥέξῃ καὶ χερσὶν ἑῇσιν. ἀλλʼ ἄγε πείρησαι, σκέδασον δʼ ἀπὸ κήδεα θυμοῦ. σοὶ δʼ ὁδὸς οὐκέτι δηρὸν ἀπέσσεται, ἀλλά τοι ἤδη νηῦς τε κατείρυσται καὶ ἐπαρτέες εἰσὶν ἑταῖροι.
"Odysseus answered, ""Laodamas, why do you taunt me in this way? My mind is set rather on cares than contests ; I have been through infinite trouble, and am come among you now as a suppliant, praying your king and to further me on my return home  ."""	τὸν δʼ ἀπαμειβόμενος προσέφη πολύμητις Ὀδυσσεύς· Λαοδάμα, τί με ταῦτα κελεύετε κερτομέοντες; κήδεά μοι καὶ μᾶλλον ἐνὶ φρεσὶν ἤ περ ἄεθλοι, ὃς πρὶν μὲν μάλα πολλὰ πάθον καὶ πολλὰ μόγησα, νῦν δὲ μεθʼ ὑμετέρῃ ἀγορῇ νόστοιο χατίζων ἧμαι, λισσόμενος βασιλῆά τε πάντα τε δῆμον.
"Then Euryalos reviled him outright and said, ""I gather, then, that you are unskilled in any of the many sports that men generally delight in. I suppose you are one of those grasping traders that go about in ships as captains or merchants, and who think of nothing but of their outward freights and homeward cargoes. There does not seem to be much of the athlete   about you."""	τὸν δʼ αὖτʼ Εὐρύαλος ἀπαμείβετο νείκεσέ τʼ ἄντην· οὐ γάρ σʼ οὐδέ, ξεῖνε, δαήμονι φωτὶ ἐίσκω ἄθλων, οἷά τε πολλὰ μετʼ ἀνθρώποισι πέλονται, ἀλλὰ τῷ, ὅς θʼ ἅμα νηὶ πολυκλήιδι θαμίζων, ἀρχὸς ναυτάων οἵ τε πρηκτῆρες ἔασιν, φόρτου τε μνήμων καὶ ἐπίσκοπος ᾖσιν ὁδαίων κερδέων θʼ ἁρπαλέων· οὐδʼ ἀθλητῆρι ἔοικας.
"""For shame, sir,"" answered Odysseus, fiercely, ""you are an insolent man - so true is it that the gods do not grace all men alike in speech, person, and understanding. One man may be of weak presence, but heaven has adorned this with such a good conversation that he charms every one who sees him; his honeyed moderation   carries his hearers with him so that he is leader in all assemblies of his fellows, and wherever he goes he is looked up to. Another may be as handsome as a god, but his good looks are not crowned with verbal grace  . This is your case. No god could make a finer looking man than you are, but you are empty with respect to . Your ill-judged remarks contrary to  have made me exceedingly angry, for I excel in a great many athletic exercises  ; indeed, so long as I had youth and strength, I was among the first athletes of the age. Now, however, I am worn out by labor and sorrow, for I have gone through much both on the field of battle and by the waves of the weary sea; still, in spite of all this I will compete  , for your taunts have stung me to the quick."""	τὸν δʼ ἄρʼ ὑπόδρα ἰδὼν προσέφη πολύμητις Ὀδυσσεύς· ξεῖνʼ, οὐ καλὸν ἔειπες· ἀτασθάλῳ ἀνδρὶ ἔοικας. οὕτως οὐ πάντεσσι θεοὶ χαρίεντα διδοῦσιν ἀνδράσιν, οὔτε φυὴν οὔτʼ ἂρ φρένας οὔτʼ ἀγορητύν. ἄλλος μὲν γάρ τʼ εἶδος ἀκιδνότερος πέλει ἀνήρ, ἀλλὰ θεὸς μορφὴν ἔπεσι στέφει, οἱ δέ τʼ ἐς αὐτὸν τερπόμενοι λεύσσουσιν· ὁ δʼ ἀσφαλέως ἀγορεύει αἰδοῖ μειλιχίῃ, μετὰ δὲ πρέπει ἀγρομένοισιν, ἐρχόμενον δʼ ἀνὰ ἄστυ θεὸν ὣς εἰσορόωσιν. ἄλλος δʼ αὖ εἶδος μὲν ἀλίγκιος ἀθανάτοισιν, ἀλλʼ οὔ οἱ χάρις ἀμφιπεριστέφεται ἐπέεσσιν, ὡς καὶ σοὶ εἶδος μὲν ἀριπρεπές, οὐδέ κεν ἄλλως οὐδὲ θεὸς τεύξειε, νόον δʼ ἀποφώλιός ἐσσι. ὤρινάς μοι θυμὸν ἐνὶ στήθεσσι φίλοισιν εἰπὼν οὐ κατὰ κόσμον. ἐγὼ δʼ οὐ νῆις ἀέθλων, ὡς σύ γε μυθεῖαι, ἀλλʼ ἐν πρώτοισιν ὀίω ἔμμεναι, ὄφρʼ ἥβῃ τε πεποίθεα χερσί τʼ ἐμῇσι. νῦν δʼ ἔχομαι κακότητι καὶ ἄλγεσι· πολλὰ γὰρ ἔτλην ἀνδρῶν τε πτολέμους ἀλεγεινά τε κύματα πείρων. ἀλλὰ καὶ ὥς, κακὰ πολλὰ παθών, πειρήσομʼ ἀέθλων· θυμοδακὴς γὰρ μῦθος, ἐπώτρυνας δέ με εἰπών.
"So he hurried up without even taking his cloak off, and seized a disc, larger, more massive and much heavier than those used by the Phaeacians when disc-throwing among themselves. Then, swinging it back, he threw it from his brawny hand, and it made a humming sound in the air as he did so. The Phaeacians quailed beneath the rushing of its flight as it sped gracefully from his hand, and flew beyond any mark   that had been made yet. Athena, in the form of a man, came and marked the place where it had fallen. ""A blind man, sir,"" said she, ""could easily tell your mark   by groping for it - it is so far ahead of any other. You may make your mind easy about this contest  , for no Phaeacian can come near to such a throw as yours."""	ἦ ῥα καὶ αὐτῷ φάρει ἀναΐξας λάβε δίσκον μείζονα καὶ πάχετον, στιβαρώτερον οὐκ ὀλίγον περ ἢ οἵῳ Φαίηκες ἐδίσκεον ἀλλήλοισι. τόν ῥα περιστρέψας ἧκε στιβαρῆς ἀπὸ χειρός, βόμβησεν δὲ λίθος· κατὰ δʼ ἔπτηξαν ποτὶ γαίῃ Φαίηκες δολιχήρετμοι, ναυσίκλυτοι ἄνδρες, λᾶος ὑπὸ ῥιπῆς· ὁ δʼ ὑπέρπτατο σήματα πάντων ῥίμφα θέων ἀπὸ χειρός. ἔθηκε δὲ τέρματʼ Ἀθήνη ἀνδρὶ δέμας ἐικυῖα, ἔπος τʼ ἔφατʼ ἔκ τʼ ὀνόμαζεν· καί κʼ ἀλαός τοι, ξεῖνε, διακρίνειε τὸ σῆμα ἀμφαφόων, ἐπεὶ οὔ τι μεμιγμένον ἐστὶν ὁμίλῳ, ἀλλὰ πολὺ πρῶτον. σὺ δὲ θάρσει τόνδε γʼ ἄεθλον· οὔ τις Φαιήκων τόδε γʼ ἵξεται, οὐδʼ ὑπερήσει.
"Odysseus was glad when he found he had a friend among the lookers-on, so he began to speak more pleasantly. ""Young men,"" said he, ""come up to that throw if you can, and I will throw another disc as heavy or even heavier. If anyone wants to have a bout with me let him come on, for I am exceedingly angry; I will box, wrestle, or run, I do not care what it is, with any man of you all except Laodamas, but not with him because I am his guest, and one cannot compete with one's own personal friend. At least I do not think it a prudent or a sensible thing for a guest to challenge his host's family at any game  , especially when he is in a foreign . He will cut the ground from under his own feet if he does; but I make no exception as regards any one else, for I want to have the matter out and know which is the best man. I am a good hand at every kind of athletic sport   known among humankind. I am an excellent archer. In battle I am always the first to bring a man down with my arrow, no matter how many more are taking aim at him alongside of me. Philoctetes was the only man who could shoot better than I could when we Achaeans were before the of the Trojans. I far excel every one else in the whole world, of those who still eat bread upon the face of the earth, but I should not like to shoot against the mighty dead, such as Herakles, or Eurytos the Cechalian- men who could shoot against the gods themselves. This in fact was how Eurytos came prematurely by his end, for Apollo was angry with him and killed him because he challenged him as an archer. I can throw a dart farther than any one else can shoot an arrow. Running is the only point in respect of which I am afraid some of the Phaeacians might beat me, for I have been brought down very low at sea; my provisions ran short, and therefore I am still weak."""	ὣς φάτο, γήθησεν δὲ πολύτλας δῖος Ὀδυσσεύς, χαὶρων, οὕνεχʼ ἑταῖρον ἐνηέα λεῦσσʼ ἐν ἀγῶνι. καὶ τότε κουφότερον μετεφώνεε Φαιήκεσσιν· τοῦτον νῦν ἀφίκεσθε, νέοι. τάχα δʼ ὕστερον ἄλλον ἥσειν ἢ τοσσοῦτον ὀίομαι ἢ ἔτι μᾶσσον. τῶν δʼ ἄλλων ὅτινα κραδίη θυμός τε κελεύει, δεῦρʼ ἄγε πειρηθήτω, ἐπεί μʼ ἐχολώσατε λίην, ἢ πὺξ ἠὲ πάλῃ ἢ καὶ ποσίν, οὔ τι μεγαίρω, πάντων Φαιήκων, πλήν γʼ αὐτοῦ Λαοδάμαντος. ξεῖνος γάρ μοι ὅδʼ ἐστί· τίς ἂν φιλέοντι μάχοιτο; ἄφρων δὴ κεῖνός γε καὶ οὐτιδανὸς πέλει ἀνήρ, ὅς τις ξεινοδόκῳ ἔριδα προφέρηται ἀέθλων δήμῳ ἐν ἀλλοδαπῷ· ἕο δʼ αὐτοῦ πάντα κολούει. τῶν δʼ ἄλλων οὔ πέρ τινʼ ἀναίνομαι οὐδʼ ἀθερίζω, ἀλλʼ ἐθέλω ἴδμεν καὶ πειρηθήμεναι ἄντην. πάντα γὰρ οὐ κακός εἰμι, μετʼ ἀνδράσιν ὅσσοι ἄεθλοι· εὖ μὲν τόξον οἶδα ἐύξοον ἀμφαφάασθαι· πρῶτός κʼ ἄνδρα βάλοιμι ὀιστεύσας ἐν ὁμίλῳ ἀνδρῶν δυσμενέων, εἰ καὶ μάλα πολλοὶ ἑταῖροι ἄγχι παρασταῖεν καὶ τοξαζοίατο φωτῶν. οἶος δή με Φιλοκτήτης ἀπεκαίνυτο τόξῳ δήμῳ ἔνι Τρώων, ὅτε τοξαζοίμεθʼ Ἀχαιοί. τῶν δʼ ἄλλων ἐμέ φημι πολὺ προφερέστερον εἶναι, ὅσσοι νῦν βροτοί εἰσιν ἐπὶ χθονὶ σῖτον ἔδοντες. ἀνδράσι δὲ προτέροισιν ἐριζέμεν οὐκ ἐθελήσω, οὔθʼ Ἡρακλῆι οὔτʼ Εὐρύτῳ Οιχαλιῆι, οἵ ῥα καὶ ἀθανάτοισιν ἐρίζεσκον περὶ τόξων. τῷ ῥα καὶ αἶψʼ ἔθανεν μέγας Εὔρυτος, οὐδʼ ἐπὶ γῆρας ἵκετʼ ἐνὶ μεγάροισι· χολωσάμενος γὰρ Ἀπόλλων ἔκτανεν, οὕνεκά μιν προκαλίζετο τοξάζεσθαι. δουρὶ δʼ ἀκοντίζω ὅσον οὐκ ἄλλος τις ὀιστῷ. οἴοισιν δείδοικα ποσὶν μή τίς με παρέλθῃ Φαιήκων· λίην γὰρ ἀεικελίως ἐδαμάσθην κύμασιν ἐν πολλοῖς, ἐπεὶ οὐ κομιδὴ κατὰ νῆα ἦεν ἐπηετανός· τῷ μοι φίλα γυῖα λέλυνται.
"They all held their peace except King Alkinoos, who began, ""Sir, we have had much pleasure in hearing all that you have told us, from which I understand that you are willing to show your prowess  , as having been displeased with some insolent remarks that have been made to you by one of our athletes, and which could never have been uttered by any one who knows how to talk with propriety. I hope you will apprehend my meaning, and will explain to any one of your chief men who may be dining with yourself and your family when you get home, that we have an hereditary aptitude   for accomplishments of all kinds. We are not particularly remarkable for our boxing, nor yet as wrestlers, but we are singularly fleet of foot and are excellent sailors. We are extremely fond of good dinners, music, and dancing  ; we also like frequent changes of linen, warm baths, and good beds; so now, please, some of you who are the best dancers set about dancing, that our guest on his return home may be able to tell his friends how much we surpass all other nations as sailors, runners, dancers, minstrels. Demodokos has left his lyre at my house, so run some one or other of you and fetch it for him."""	ὣς ἔφαθʼ, οἱ δʼ ἄρα πάντες ἀκὴν ἐγένοντο σιωπῇ.

On this a servant hurried off to bring the lyre from the king's house, and the nine men who had been chosen as stewards stood forward. It was their business to manage everything connected with the sports, so they made the ground smooth and marked a wide space for the dancers  . Presently the servant came back with Demodokos’ lyre, and he took his place in the midst of them, whereon the best young dancers   in the town began to foot and trip it so nimbly that Odysseus was delighted with the merry twinkling of their feet.	ὣς ἔφατʼ Ἀλκίνοος θεοείκελος, ὦρτο δὲ κῆρυξ οἴσων φόρμιγγα γλαφυρὴν δόμου ἐκ βασιλῆος. αἰσυμνῆται δὲ κριτοὶ ἐννέα πάντες ἀνέσταν δήμιοι, οἳ κατʼ ἀγῶνας ἐὺ πρήσσεσκον ἕκαστα, λείηναν δὲ χορόν, καλὸν δʼ εὔρυναν ἀγῶνα. κῆρυξ δʼ ἐγγύθεν ἦλθε φέρων φόρμιγγα λίγειαν Δημοδόκῳ· ὁ δʼ ἔπειτα κίʼ ἐς μέσον· ἀμφὶ δὲ κοῦροι πρωθῆβαι ἵσταντο, δαήμονες ὀρχηθμοῖο, πέπληγον δὲ χορὸν θεῖον ποσίν. αὐτὰρ Ὀδυσσεὺς μαρμαρυγὰς θηεῖτο ποδῶν, θαύμαζε δὲ θυμῷ.
Meanwhile the bard began to sing the loves of Ares and Aphrodite, and how they first began their intrigue in the house of Hephaistos. Ares made Aphrodite many presents, and defiled lord Hephaistos’ marriage bed, so the sun, who saw what they were about, told Hephaistos. Hephaistos was very angry when he heard such dreadful news, so he went to his smithy brooding mischief, got his great anvil into its place, and began to forge some chains which none could either unloose or break, so that they might stay there in that place. When he had finished his snare he went into his bedroom and festooned the bed-posts all over with chains like cobwebs; he also let many hang down from the great beam of the ceiling. Not even a god could see them, so fine and subtle were they. As soon as he had spread the chains all over the bed, he made as though he were setting out for the fair state of Lemnos , which of all places in the world was the one he was most fond of. But Ares kept no blind look out, and as soon as he saw him start, hurried off to his house, burning with love for Aphrodite.	αὐτὰρ ὁ φορμίζων ἀνεβάλλετο καλὸν ἀείδειν ἀμφʼ Ἄρεος φιλότητος εὐστεφάνου τʼ Ἀφροδίτης, ὡς τὰ πρῶτα μίγησαν ἐν Ἡφαίστοιο δόμοισι λάθρῃ, πολλὰ δʼ ἔδωκε, λέχος δʼ ᾔσχυνε καὶ εὐνὴν Ἡφαίστοιο ἄνακτος. ἄφαρ δέ οἱ ἄγγελος ἦλθεν Ἥλιος, ὅ σφʼ ἐνόησε μιγαζομένους φιλότητι. Ἥφαιστος δʼ ὡς οὖν θυμαλγέα μῦθον ἄκουσε, βῆ ῥʼ ἴμεν ἐς χαλκεῶνα κακὰ φρεσὶ βυσσοδομεύων, ἐν δʼ ἔθετʼ ἀκμοθέτῳ μέγαν ἄκμονα, κόπτε δὲ δεσμοὺς ἀρρήκτους ἀλύτους, ὄφρʼ ἔμπεδον αὖθι μένοιεν. αὐτὰρ ἐπεὶ δὴ τεῦξε δόλον κεχολωμένος Ἄρει, βῆ ῥʼ ἴμεν ἐς θάλαμον, ὅθι οἱ φίλα δέμνιʼ ἔκειτο, ἀμφὶ δʼ ἄρʼ ἑρμῖσιν χέε δέσματα κύκλῳ ἁπάντῃ· πολλὰ δὲ καὶ καθύπερθε μελαθρόφιν ἐξεκέχυντο, ἠύτʼ ἀράχνια λεπτά, τά γʼ οὔ κέ τις οὐδὲ ἴδοιτο, οὐδὲ θεῶν μακάρων· πέρι γὰρ δολόεντα τέτυκτο. αὐτὰρ ἐπεὶ δὴ πάντα δόλον περὶ δέμνια χεῦεν, εἴσατʼ ἴμεν ἐς Λῆμνον, ἐυκτίμενον πτολίεθρον, ἥ οἱ γαιάων πολὺ φιλτάτη ἐστὶν ἁπασέων. οὐδʼ ἀλαοσκοπιὴν εἶχε χρυσήνιος Ἄρης, ὡς ἴδεν Ἥφαιστον κλυτοτέχνην νόσφι κιόντα· βῆ δʼ ἰέναι πρὸς δῶμα περικλυτοῦ Ἡφαίστοιο ἰσχανόων φιλότητος ἐυστεφάνου Κυθερείης.
"Now Aphrodite was just come in from a visit to her father Zeus, and was about sitting down when Ares came inside the house, and said as he took her hand in his own, ""Let us go to the couch of Hephaistos: he is not at home, but is gone off to Lemnos among the Sintians, whose speech is barbarous."""	ἡ δὲ νέον παρὰ πατρὸς ἐρισθενέος Κρονίωνος ἐρχομένη κατʼ ἄρʼ ἕζεθʼ· ὁ δʼ εἴσω δώματος ᾔει, ἔν τʼ ἄρα οἱ φῦ χειρί, ἔπος τʼ ἔφατʼ ἔκ τʼ ὀνόμαζε· δεῦρο, φίλη, λέκτρονδε τραπείομεν εὐνηθέντες· οὐ γὰρ ἔθʼ Ἥφαιστος μεταδήμιος, ἀλλά που ἤδη οἴχεται ἐς Λῆμνον μετὰ Σίντιας ἀγριοφώνους.
She was not unwilling, so they went to the couch to take their rest, whereon they were caught in the toils which cunning Hephaistos had spread for them, and could neither get up nor stir hand or foot, but found too late that they were in a trap. Then Hephaistos came up to them, for he had turned back before reaching Lemnos , when his scout the sun told him what was going on. He was in a furious passion, and stood in the vestibule making a dreadful noise as he shouted to all the gods.	ὣς φάτο, τῇ δʼ ἀσπαστὸν ἐείσατο κοιμηθῆναι. τὼ δʼ ἐς δέμνια βάντε κατέδραθον· ἀμφὶ δὲ δεσμοὶ τεχνήεντες ἔχυντο πολύφρονος Ἡφαίστοιο, οὐδέ τι κινῆσαι μελέων ἦν οὐδʼ ἀναεῖραι. καὶ τότε δὴ γίγνωσκον, ὅ τʼ οὐκέτι φυκτὰ πέλοντο. ἀγχίμολον δέ σφʼ ἦλθε περικλυτὸς ἀμφιγυήεις, αὖτις ὑποστρέψας πρὶν Λήμνου γαῖαν ἱκέσθαι· Ἠέλιος γάρ οἱ σκοπιὴν ἔχεν εἶπέ τε μῦθον. βῆ δʼ ἴμεναι πρὸς δῶμα φίλον τετιημένος ἦτορ· ἔστη δʼ ἐν προθύροισι, χόλος δέ μιν ἄγριος ᾕρει· σμερδαλέον δʼ ἐβόησε, γέγωνέ τε πᾶσι θεοῖσιν·
"""Father Zeus,"" he cried, ""and all you other blessed gods who live for ever, come here and see the ridiculous and disgraceful sight that I will show you. Zeus’ daughter Aphrodite is always dishonoring me because I am lame. She is in love with Ares, who is handsome and clean built, whereas I am a cripple - but my parents are responsible   for that, not I; they ought never to have begotten me. Come and see the pair together asleep on my bed. It makes me furious to look at them. They are very fond of one another, but I do not think they will lie there longer than they can help, nor do I think that they will sleep much; there, however, they shall stay till her father has repaid me the sum I gave him for his baggage of a daughter, who is fair but not honest."""	Ζεῦ πάτερ ἠδʼ ἄλλοι μάκαρες θεοὶ αἰὲν ἐόντες, δεῦθʼ, ἵνα ἔργα γελαστὰ καὶ οὐκ ἐπιεικτὰ ἴδησθε, ὡς ἐμὲ χωλὸν ἐόντα Διὸς θυγάτηρ Ἀφροδίτη αἰὲν ἀτιμάζει, φιλέει δʼ ἀίδηλον Ἄρηα, οὕνεχʼ ὁ μὲν καλός τε καὶ ἀρτίπος, αὐτὰρ ἐγώ γε ἠπεδανὸς γενόμην. ἀτὰρ οὔ τί μοι αἴτιος ἄλλος, ἀλλὰ τοκῆε δύω, τὼ μὴ γείνασθαι ὄφελλον. ἀλλʼ ὄψεσθʼ, ἵνα τώ γε καθεύδετον ἐν φιλότητι εἰς ἐμὰ δέμνια βάντες, ἐγὼ δʼ ὁρόων ἀκάχημαι. οὐ μέν σφεας ἔτʼ ἔολπα μίνυνθά γε κειέμεν οὕτως καὶ μάλα περ φιλέοντε· τάχʼ οὐκ ἐθελήσετον ἄμφω εὕδειν· ἀλλά σφωε δόλος καὶ δεσμὸς ἐρύξει, εἰς ὅ κέ μοι μάλα πάντα πατὴρ ἀποδῷσιν ἔεδνα, ὅσσα οἱ ἐγγυάλιξα κυνώπιδος εἵνεκα κούρης, οὕνεκά οἱ καλὴ θυγάτηρ, ἀτὰρ οὐκ ἐχέθυμος.
On this the gods gathered to the house of Hephaistos. Earth-encircling Poseidon came, and Hermes the bringer of luck, and lord Apollo, but the goddesses stayed at home all of them for shame. Then the givers of all good things stood in the doorway, and the blessed gods roared with inextinguishable laughter, as they saw how cunning Hephaistos had been, whereon one would turn towards his neighbor saying:	ὣς ἔφαθʼ, οἱ δʼ ἀγέροντο θεοὶ ποτὶ χαλκοβατὲς δῶ· ἦλθε Ποσειδάων γαιήοχος, ἦλθʼ ἐριούνης Ἑρμείας, ἦλθεν δὲ ἄναξ ἑκάεργος Ἀπόλλων. θηλύτεραι δὲ θεαὶ μένον αἰδοῖ οἴκοι ἑκάστη. ἔσταν δʼ ἐν προθύροισι θεοί, δωτῆρες ἑάων· ἄσβεστος δʼ ἄρʼ ἐνῶρτο γέλως μακάρεσσι θεοῖσι τέχνας εἰσορόωσι πολύφρονος Ἡφαίστοιο. ὧδε δέ τις εἴπεσκεν ἰδὼν ἐς πλησίον ἄλλον·
"""Ill deeds do not bring , and the weak confound the strong. See how limping Hephaistos, lame as he is, has caught Ares who is the fleetest god in heaven; and now Ares will be cast in heavy damages."""	οὐκ ἀρετᾷ κακὰ ἔργα· κιχάνει τοι βραδὺς ὠκύν, ὡς καὶ νῦν Ἥφαιστος ἐὼν βραδὺς εἷλεν Ἄρηα ὠκύτατόν περ ἐόντα θεῶν οἳ Ὄλυμπον ἔχουσιν, χωλὸς ἐὼν τέχνῃσι· τὸ καὶ μοιχάγριʼ ὀφέλλει.
"Thus did they converse, but lord Apollo said to Hermes, ""Messenger Hermes, giver of good things, you would not care how strong the chains were, would you, if you could sleep with Aphrodite?"""	ὣς οἱ μὲν τοιαῦτα πρὸς ἀλλήλους ἀγόρευον· Ἑρμῆν δὲ προσέειπεν ἄναξ Διὸς υἱὸς Ἀπόλλων· Ἑρμεία, Διὸς υἱέ, διάκτορε, δῶτορ ἑάων, ἦ ῥά κεν ἐν δεσμοῖς ἐθέλοις κρατεροῖσι πιεσθεὶς εὕδειν ἐν λέκτροισι παρὰ χρυσέῃ Ἀφροδίτῃ;
"""King Apollo,"" answered Hermes, ""I only wish I might get the chance, though there were three times as many chains - and you might look on, all of you, gods and goddesses, but I would sleep with her if I could."""	τὸν δʼ ἠμείβετʼ ἔπειτα διάκτορος ἀργεϊφόντης· αἲ γὰρ τοῦτο γένοιτο, ἄναξ ἑκατηβόλʼ Ἄπολλον· δεσμοὶ μὲν τρὶς τόσσοι ἀπείρονες ἀμφὶς ἔχοιεν, ὑμεῖς δʼ εἰσορόῳτε θεοὶ πᾶσαί τε θέαιναι, αὐτὰρ ἐγὼν εὕδοιμι παρὰ χρυσέῃ Ἀφροδίτῃ.
"The immortal gods burst out laughing as they heard him, but Poseidon took it all seriously, and kept on imploring Hephaistos to set Ares free again. ""Let him go,"" he cried, ""and I will undertake, as you require, that he shall pay you all the damages that are held reasonable among the immortal gods."""	ὣς ἔφατʼ, ἐν δὲ γέλως ὦρτʼ ἀθανάτοισι θεοῖσιν. οὐδὲ Ποσειδάωνα γέλως ἔχε, λίσσετο δʼ αἰεὶ Ἥφαιστον κλυτοεργὸν ὅπως λύσειεν Ἄρηα. καί μιν φωνήσας ἔπεα πτερόεντα προσηύδα· λῦσον· ἐγὼ δέ τοι αὐτὸν ὑπίσχομαι, ὡς σὺ κελεύεις, τίσειν αἴσιμα πάντα μετʼ ἀθανάτοισι θεοῖσιν.
"""Do not,"" replied Hephaistos, ""ask me to do this; a bad man's bond is bad security; what remedy could I enforce against you if Ares should go away and leave his debts behind him along with his chains?"""	τὸν δʼ αὖτε προσέειπε περικλυτὸς ἀμφιγυήεις· μή με, Ποσείδαον γαιήοχε, ταῦτα κέλευε· δειλαί τοι δειλῶν γε καὶ ἐγγύαι ἐγγυάασθαι. πῶς ἂν ἐγώ σε δέοιμι μετʼ ἀθανάτοισι θεοῖσιν, εἴ κεν Ἄρης οἴχοιτο χρέος καὶ δεσμὸν ἀλύξας;
"""Hephaistos,"" said Poseidon, ""if Ares goes away without paying his damages, I will pay you myself."" So Hephaistos answered, ""In this case I cannot and must not refuse you."""	τὸν δʼ αὖτε προσέειπε Ποσειδάων ἐνοσίχθων· Ἥφαιστʼ, εἴ περ γάρ κεν Ἄρης χρεῖος ὑπαλύξας οἴχηται φεύγων, αὐτός τοι ἐγὼ τάδε τίσω. τὸν δʼ ἠμείβετʼ ἔπειτα περικλυτὸς ἀμφιγυήεις· οὐκ ἔστʼ οὐδὲ ἔοικε τεὸν ἔπος ἀρνήσασθαι.
Thereon he loosed the bonds that bound them, and as soon as they were free they scampered off, Ares to Thrace and laughter-loving Aphrodite to Cyprus and to Paphos , where is her grove and her altar fragrant with burnt offerings. Here the Graces bathed her, and anointed her with oil of ambrosia such as the immortal gods make use of, and they clothed her in raiment of the most enchanting beauty.	ὣς εἰπὼν δεσμὸν ἀνίει μένος Ἡφαίστοιο. τὼ δʼ ἐπεὶ ἐκ δεσμοῖο λύθεν, κρατεροῦ περ ἐόντος, αὐτίκʼ ἀναΐξαντε ὁ μὲν Θρῄκηνδε βεβήκει, ἡ δʼ ἄρα Κύπρον ἵκανε φιλομμειδὴς Ἀφροδίτη, ἐς Πάφον· ἔνθα δέ οἱ τέμενος βωμός τε θυήεις. ἔνθα δέ μιν Χάριτες λοῦσαν καὶ χρῖσαν ἐλαίῳ ἀμβρότῳ, οἷα θεοὺς ἐπενήνοθεν αἰὲν ἐόντας, ἀμφὶ δὲ εἵματα ἕσσαν ἐπήρατα, θαῦμα ἰδέσθαι.
Thus sang the bard, and both Odysseus and the seafaring Phaeacians were charmed as they heard him.	ταῦτʼ ἄρʼ ἀοιδὸς ἄειδε περικλυτός· αὐτὰρ Ὀδυσσεὺς τέρπετʼ ἐνὶ φρεσὶν ᾗσιν ἀκούων ἠδὲ καὶ ἄλλοι Φαίηκες δολιχήρετμοι, ναυσίκλυτοι ἄνδρες.
Then Alkinoos told Laodamas and Halios to dance alone, for there was no one to compete with them. So they took a red ball which Polybos had made for them, and one of them bent himself backwards and threw it up towards the clouds, while the other jumped from off the ground and caught it with ease before it came down again. When they had done throwing the ball straight up into the air they began to dance, and at the same time kept on throwing it backwards and forwards to one another, while all the young men in the ring applauded and made a great stamping with their feet. Then Odysseus said:	Ἀλκίνοος δʼ Ἅλιον καὶ Λαοδάμαντα κέλευσεν μουνὰξ ὀρχήσασθαι, ἐπεί σφισιν οὔ τις ἔριζεν. οἱ δʼ ἐπεὶ οὖν σφαῖραν καλὴν μετὰ χερσὶν ἕλοντο, πορφυρέην, τήν σφιν Πόλυβος ποίησε δαΐφρων, τὴν ἕτερος ῥίπτασκε ποτὶ νέφεα σκιόεντα ἰδνωθεὶς ὀπίσω, ὁ δʼ ἀπὸ χθονὸς ὑψόσʼ ἀερθεὶς ῥηιδίως μεθέλεσκε, πάρος ποσὶν οὖδας ἱκέσθαι. αὐτὰρ ἐπεὶ δὴ σφαίρῃ ἀνʼ ἰθὺν πειρήσαντο, ὠρχείσθην δὴ ἔπειτα ποτὶ χθονὶ πουλυβοτείρῃ ταρφέʼ ἀμειβομένω· κοῦροι δʼ ἐπελήκεον ἄλλοι ἑστεῶτες κατʼ ἀγῶνα, πολὺς δʼ ὑπὸ κόμπος ὀρώρει. δὴ τότʼ ἄρʼ Ἀλκίνοον προσεφώνεε δῖος Ὀδυσσεύς·
"""King Alkinoos, you said your people were the nimblest dancers in the world, and indeed they have proved themselves to be so. I was astonished as I saw them."""	Ἀλκίνοε κρεῖον, πάντων ἀριδείκετε λαῶν, ἠμὲν ἀπείλησας βητάρμονας εἶναι ἀρίστους, ἠδʼ ἄρʼ ἑτοῖμα τέτυκτο· σέβας μʼ ἔχει εἰσορόωντα.
"The king was delighted at this, and exclaimed to the Phaeacians ""Aldermen and town councilors, our guest seems to be a person of singular judgment; let us give him such proof of our hospitality as he may reasonably expect. There are twelve chief men throughout the , and counting myself there are thirteen; contribute, each of you, a clean cloak, a shirt, and a talent of fine gold; let us give him all this in a lump down at once, so that when he gets his supper he may do so with a light heart. As for Euryalos, he will have to make a formal apology and a present too, for he has been rude."""	ὣς φάτο, γήθησεν δʼ ἱερὸν μένος Ἀλκινόοιο, αἶψα δὲ Φαιήκεσσι φιληρέτμοισι μετηύδα· κέκλυτε, Φαιήκων ἡγήτορες ἠδὲ μέδοντες. ὁ ξεῖνος μάλα μοι δοκέει πεπνυμένος εἶναι. ἀλλʼ ἄγε οἱ δῶμεν ξεινήιον, ὡς ἐπιεικές. δώδεκα γὰρ κατὰ δῆμον ἀριπρεπέες βασιλῆες ἀρχοὶ κραίνουσι, τρισκαιδέκατος δʼ ἐγὼ αὐτός· τῶν οἱ ἕκαστος φᾶρος ἐυπλυνὲς ἠδὲ χιτῶνα καὶ χρυσοῖο τάλαντον ἐνείκατε τιμήεντος. αἶψα δὲ πάντα φέρωμεν ἀολλέα, ὄφρʼ ἐνὶ χερσὶν ξεῖνος ἔχων ἐπὶ δόρπον ἴῃ χαίρων ἐνὶ θυμῷ. Εὐρύαλος δέ ἑ αὐτὸν ἀρεσσάσθω ἐπέεσσι καὶ δώρῳ, ἐπεὶ οὔ τι ἔπος κατὰ μοῖραν ἔειπεν.
"Thus did he speak. The others all of them applauded his saying, and sent their servants to fetch the presents. Then Euryalos said, ""King Alkinoos, I will give the stranger all the satisfaction you require. He shall have sword, which is of bronze, all but the hilt, which is of silver. I will also give him the scabbard of newly sawn ivory into which it fits. It will be worth a great deal to him."""	ὣς ἔφαθʼ, οἱ δʼ ἄρα πάντες ἐπῄνεον ἠδʼ ἐκέλευον, δῶρα δʼ ἄρʼ οἰσέμεναι πρόεσαν κήρυκα ἕκαστος. τὸν δʼ αὖτʼ Εὐρύαλος ἀπαμείβετο φώνησέν τε· Ἀλκίνοε κρεῖον, πάντων ἀριδείκετε λαῶν, τοιγὰρ ἐγὼ τὸν ξεῖνον ἀρέσσομαι, ὡς σὺ κελεύεις. δώσω οἱ τόδʼ ἄορ παγχάλκεον, ᾧ ἔπι κώπη ἀργυρέη, κολεὸν δὲ νεοπρίστου ἐλέφαντος ἀμφιδεδίνηται· πολέος δέ οἱ ἄξιον ἔσται.
"As he spoke he placed the sword in the hands of Odysseus and said, ""Good luck to you, father stranger; if anything has been said amiss may the winds blow it away with them, and may heaven grant you a safe return, for I understand you have been long away from home, and have gone through much hardship."""	ὣς εἰπὼν ἐν χερσὶ τίθει ξίφος ἀργυρόηλον καί μιν φωνήσας ἔπεα πτερόεντα προσηύδα· χαῖρε, πάτερ ὦ ξεῖνε· ἔπος δʼ εἴ πέρ τι βέβακται δεινόν, ἄφαρ τὸ φέροιεν ἀναρπάξασαι ἄελλαι. σοὶ δὲ θεοὶ ἄλοχόν τʼ ἰδέειν καὶ πατρίδʼ ἱκέσθαι δοῖεν, ἐπεὶ δὴ δηθὰ φίλων ἄπο πήματα πάσχεις.
"To which Odysseus answered, ""Good luck to you too my friend, and may the gods grant you every happiness  . I hope you will not miss the sword you have given me along with your apology."""	τὸν δʼ ἀπαμειβόμενος προσέφη πολύμητις Ὀδυσσεύς· καὶ σὺ φίλος μάλα χαῖρε, θεοὶ δέ τοι ὄλβια δοῖεν. μηδέ τι τοι ξίφεός γε ποθὴ μετόπισθε γένοιτο τούτου, ὃ δή μοι δῶκας ἀρεσσάμενος ἐπέεσσιν.
With these words he girded the sword about his shoulders and towards sundown the presents began to make their appearance, as the servants of the donors kept bringing them to the house of King Alkinoos; here his sons received them, and placed them under their mother's charge. Then Alkinoos led the way to the house and bade his guests take their seats.	ἦ ῥα καὶ ἀμφʼ ὤμοισι θέτο ξίφος ἀργυρόηλον. δύσετό τʼ ἠέλιος, καὶ τῷ κλυτὰ δῶρα παρῆεν. καὶ τά γʼ ἐς Ἀλκινόοιο φέρον κήρυκες ἀγαυοί· δεξάμενοι δʼ ἄρα παῖδες ἀμύμονος Ἀλκινόοιο μητρὶ παρʼ αἰδοίῃ ἔθεσαν περικαλλέα δῶρα. τοῖσιν δʼ ἡγεμόνευʼ ἱερὸν μένος Ἀλκινόοιο, ἐλθόντες δὲ καθῖζον ἐν ὑψηλοῖσι θρόνοισι. δή ῥα τότʼ Ἀρήτην προσέφη μένος Ἀλκινόοιο·
"""Wife,"" said he, turning to Queen Arete, ""Go, fetch the best chest we have, and put a clean cloak and shirt in it. Also, set a copper on the fire and heat some water; our guest will take a warm bath; see also to the careful packing of the presents that the noble Phaeacians have made him; he will thus better enjoy both his supper and the singing that will follow. I shall myself give him this golden goblet - which is of exquisite workmanship - that he may be reminded of me for the rest of his life whenever he makes a drink-offering to Zeus, or to any of the gods."""	δεῦρο, γύναι, φέρε χηλὸν ἀριπρεπέʼ, ἥ τις ἀρίστη· ἐν δʼ αὐτὴ θὲς φᾶρος ἐυπλυνὲς ἠδὲ χιτῶνα. ἀμφὶ δέ οἱ πυρὶ χαλκὸν ἰήνατε, θέρμετε δʼ ὕδωρ, ὄφρα λοεσσάμενός τε ἰδών τʼ ἐὺ κείμενα πάντα δῶρα, τά οἱ Φαίηκες ἀμύμονες ἐνθάδʼ ἔνεικαν, δαιτί τε τέρπηται καὶ ἀοιδῆς ὕμνον ἀκούων. καί οἱ ἐγὼ τόδʼ ἄλεισον ἐμὸν περικαλλὲς ὀπάσσω, χρύσεον, ὄφρʼ ἐμέθεν μεμνημένος ἤματα πάντα σπένδῃ ἐνὶ μεγάρῳ Διί τʼ ἄλλοισίν τε θεοῖσιν.
Then Arete told her maids to set a large tripod upon the fire as fast as they could, whereon they set a tripod full of bath water on to a clear fire; they threw on sticks to make it blaze, and the water became hot as the flame played about the belly of the tripod. Meanwhile Arete brought a magnificent chest her own room, and inside it she packed all the beautiful presents of gold and raiment which the Phaeacians had brought. Lastly she added a cloak and a good shirt from Alkinoos, and said to Odysseus:	ὣς ἔφατʼ, Ἀρήτη δὲ μετὰ δμῳῇσιν ἔειπεν ἀμφὶ πυρὶ στῆσαι τρίποδα μέγαν ὅττι τάχιστα. αἱ δὲ λοετροχόον τρίποδʼ ἵστασαν ἐν πυρὶ κηλέῳ, ἔν δʼ ἄρʼ ὕδωρ ἔχεαν, ὑπὸ δὲ ξύλα δαῖον ἑλοῦσαι. γάστρην μὲν τρίποδος πῦρ ἄμφεπε, θέρμετο δʼ ὕδωρ· τόφρα δʼ ἄρʼ Ἀρήτη ξείνῳ περικαλλέα χηλὸν ἐξέφερεν θαλάμοιο, τίθει δʼ ἐνὶ κάλλιμα δῶρα, ἐσθῆτα χρυσόν τε, τά οἱ Φαίηκες ἔδωκαν· ἐν δʼ αὐτὴ φᾶρος θῆκεν καλόν τε χιτῶνα, καί μιν φωνήσασʼ ἔπεα πτερόεντα προσηύδα·
"""See to the lid yourself, and have the whole bound round at once, for fear any one should rob you by the way when you are asleep in your ship."""	αὐτὸς νῦν ἴδε πῶμα, θοῶς δʼ ἐπὶ δεσμὸν ἴηλον, μή τίς τοι καθʼ ὁδὸν δηλήσεται, ὁππότʼ ἂν αὖτε εὕδῃσθα γλυκὺν ὕπνον ἰὼν ἐν νηὶ μελαίνῃ.
"When Odysseus heard this he put the lid on the chest and made it fast with a bond that Circe had taught him. He had done so before an upper servant told him to come to the bath and wash himself. He was very glad of a warm bath, for he had had no one to wait upon him ever since he left the house of Calypso, who as long as he remained with her had taken as good care of him as though he had been a god. When the servants had done washing and anointing him with oil, and had given him a clean cloak and shirt, he left the bath room and joined the guests who were sitting over their wine. Lovely Nausicaa stood by one of the bearing-posts supporting the roof of the room, and admired him as she saw him pass. ""Farewell stranger,"" said she, ""do not forget me when you are safe at home again, for it is to me first that you owe a ransom for having saved your life."""	αὐτὰρ ἐπεὶ τό γʼ ἄκουσε πολύτλας δῖος Ὀδυσσεύς, αὐτίκʼ ἐπήρτυε πῶμα, θοῶς δʼ ἐπὶ δεσμὸν ἴηλεν ποικίλον, ὅν ποτέ μιν δέδαε φρεσὶ πότνια Κίρκη· αὐτόδιον δʼ ἄρα μιν ταμίη λούσασθαι ἀνώγει ἔς ῥʼ ἀσάμινθον βάνθʼ· ὁ δʼ ἄρ ἀσπασίως ἴδε θυμῷ θερμὰ λοέτρʼ, ἐπεὶ οὔ τι κομιζόμενός γε θάμιζεν, ἐπεὶ δὴ λίπε δῶμα Καλυψοῦς ἠυκόμοιο. τόφρα δέ οἱ κομιδή γε θεῷ ὣς ἔμπεδος ἦεν. τὸν δʼ ἐπεὶ οὖν δμῳαὶ λοῦσαν καὶ χρῖσαν ἐλαίῳ, ἀμφὶ δέ μιν χλαῖναν καλὴν βάλον ἠδὲ χιτῶνα, ἔκ ῥʼ ἀσαμίνθου βὰς ἄνδρας μέτα οἰνοποτῆρας ἤιε· Ναυσικάα δὲ θεῶν ἄπο κάλλος ἔχουσα στῆ ῥα παρὰ σταθμὸν τέγεος πύκα ποιητοῖο, θαύμαζεν δʼ Ὀδυσῆα ἐν ὀφθαλμοῖσιν ὁρῶσα, καί μιν φωνήσασʼ ἔπεα πτερόεντα προσηύδα· χαῖρε, ξεῖνʼ, ἵνα καί ποτʼ ἐὼν ἐν πατρίδι γαίῃ μνήσῃ ἐμεῦ, ὅτι μοι πρώτῃ ζωάγριʼ ὀφέλλεις.
"And Odysseus said, ""Nausicaa, daughter of great Alkinoos, may Zeus the mighty husband of Hera, grant that I may reach my home and see my day of ; so shall I bless you as a goddess all my days, for it was you who saved me."""	τὴν δʼ ἀπαμειβόμενος προσέφη πολύμητις Ὀδυσσεύς. Ναυσικάα θύγατερ μεγαλήτορος Ἀλκινόοιο, οὕτω νῦν Ζεὺς θείη, ἐρίγδουπος πόσις Ἥρης, οἴκαδέ τʼ ἐλθέμεναι καὶ νόστιμον ἦμαρ ἰδέσθαι· τῷ κέν τοι καὶ κεῖθι θεῷ ὣς εὐχετοῴμην αἰεὶ ἤματα πάντα· σὺ γάρ μʼ ἐβιώσαο, κούρη.
"When he had said this, he seated himself beside Alkinoos. Supper was then served, and the wine was mixed for drinking. A servant led in the favorite bard Demodokos, and set him in the midst of the company, near one of the bearing-posts supporting the room, that he might lean against it. Then Odysseus cut off a piece of roast pork with plenty of fat (for there was abundance left on the joint) and said to a servant, ""Take this piece of pork over to Demodokos and tell him to eat it; for all the pain his lays may cause me I will salute him none the less; bards get honor and respect   throughout the world, for the Muse teaches them their songs and loves them."""	ἦ ῥα καὶ ἐς θρόνον ἷζε παρʼ Ἀλκίνοον βασιλῆα· οἱ δʼ ἤδη μοίρας τʼ ἔνεμον κερόωντό τε οἶνον. κῆρυξ δʼ ἐγγύθεν ἦλθεν ἄγων ἐρίηρον ἀοιδόν, Δημόδοκον λαοῖσι τετιμένον· εἷσε δʼ ἄρʼ αὐτὸν μέσσῳ δαιτυμόνων, πρὸς κίονα μακρὸν ἐρείσας. δὴ τότε κήρυκα προσέφη πολύμητις Ὀδυσσεύς, νώτου ἀποπροταμών, ἐπὶ δὲ πλεῖον ἐλέλειπτο, ἀργιόδοντος ὑός, θαλερὴ δʼ ἦν ἀμφὶς ἀλοιφή· κῆρυξ, τῆ δή, τοῦτο πόρε κρέας, ὄφρα φάγῃσιν, Δημοδόκῳ· καί μιν προσπτύξομαι ἀχνύμενός περ· πᾶσι γὰρ ἀνθρώποισιν ἐπιχθονίοισιν ἀοιδοὶ τιμῆς ἔμμοροί εἰσι καὶ αἰδοῦς, οὕνεκʼ ἄρα σφέας οἴμας μοῦσʼ ἐδίδαξε, φίλησε δὲ φῦλον ἀοιδῶν.
"The servant carried the pork in his fingers over to Demodokos, who took it and was very much pleased. They then laid their hands on the good things that were before them, and as soon as they had had enough to eat and drink, Odysseus said to Demodokos, ""Demodokos, there is no one in the world whom I praise with admiration more than I do you. You must have studied under the Muse, Zeus’ daughter, and under Apollo, - with such a sense of order   do you sing the return of the Achaeans with all their sufferings and adventures. If you were not there yourself, you must have heard it all from some one who was. Now, however, change your song and tell us of the construction   of the wooden horse which Epeios made with the assistance of Athena, and which Odysseus got by stratagem into the fort of Troy after freighting it with the men who afterwards sacked the city. If you will sing this tale aright I will tell all the world how magnificently heaven has endowed you."""	ὣς ἄρʼ ἔφη, κῆρυξ δὲ φέρων ἐν χερσὶν ἔθηκεν ἥρῳ Δημοδόκῳ· ὁ δʼ ἐδέξατο, χαῖρε δὲ θυμῷ. οἱ δʼ ἐπʼ ὀνείαθʼ ἑτοῖμα προκείμενα χεῖρας ἴαλλον. αὐτὰρ ἐπεὶ πόσιος καὶ ἐδητύος ἐξ ἔρον ἕντο, δὴ τότε Δημόδοκον προσέφη πολύμητις Ὀδυσσεύς· Δημόδοκʼ, ἔξοχα δή σε βροτῶν αἰνίζομʼ ἁπάντων. ἢ σέ γε μοῦσʼ ἐδίδαξε, Διὸς πάϊς, ἢ σέ γʼ Ἀπόλλων· λίην γὰρ κατὰ κόσμον Ἀχαιῶν οἶτον ἀείδεις, ὅσσʼ ἔρξαν τʼ ἔπαθόν τε καὶ ὅσσʼ ἐμόγησαν Ἀχαιοί, ὥς τέ που ἢ αὐτὸς παρεὼν ἢ ἄλλου ἀκούσας. ἀλλʼ ἄγε δὴ μετάβηθι καὶ ἵππου κόσμον ἄεισον δουρατέου, τὸν Ἐπειὸς ἐποίησεν σὺν Ἀθήνῃ, ὅν ποτʼ ἐς ἀκρόπολιν δόλον ἤγαγε δῖος Ὀδυσσεὺς ἀνδρῶν ἐμπλήσας οἵ ῥʼ Ἴλιον ἐξαλάπαξαν. αἴ κεν δή μοι ταῦτα κατὰ μοῖραν καταλέξῃς, αὐτίκʼ ἐγὼ πᾶσιν μυθήσομαι ἀνθρώποισιν, ὡς ἄρα τοι πρόφρων θεὸς ὤπασε θέσπιν ἀοιδήν.
The bard, inspired by a god, lit up the picture of his story, starting at the point where some of the Argives set fire to their tents and sailed away while others, hidden within the horse, were waiting with Odysseus in the Trojan place of assembly. For the Trojans themselves had drawn the horse into their fortress, and it stood there while they sat in council round it, and were in three minds as to what they should do. Some were for breaking it up then and there; others would have it dragged to the top of the rock on which the fortress stood, and then thrown down the precipice; while yet others were for letting it remain as an offering and propitiation for the gods. And this was how they settled it in the end, for the city was doomed when it took in that horse, within which were all the bravest of the Argives waiting to bring death and destruction on the Trojans. Anon he sang how the sons of the Achaeans issued from the horse, and sacked the town, breaking out from their ambuscade. He sang how they overran the city here and there and ravaged it, and how Odysseus went raging like Ares along with Menelaos to the house of Deiphobos. It was there that the fight raged most furiously, nevertheless by Athena's help he was victorious.	ὣς φάθʼ, ὁ δʼ ὁρμηθεὶς θεοῦ ἤρχετο, φαῖνε δʼ ἀοιδήν, ἔνθεν ἑλὼν ὡς οἱ μὲν ἐυσσέλμων ἐπὶ νηῶν βάντες ἀπέπλειον, πῦρ ἐν κλισίῃσι βαλόντες, Ἀργεῖοι, τοὶ δʼ ἤδη ἀγακλυτὸν ἀμφʼ Ὀδυσῆα ἥατʼ ἐνὶ Τρώων ἀγορῇ κεκαλυμμένοι ἵππῳ· αὐτοὶ γάρ μιν Τρῶες ἐς ἀκρόπολιν ἐρύσαντο. ὣς ὁ μὲν ἑστήκει, τοὶ δʼ ἄκριτα πόλλʼ ἀγόρευον ἥμενοι ἀμφʼ αὐτόν· τρίχα δέ σφισιν ἥνδανε βουλή, ἠὲ διαπλῆξαι κοῖλον δόρυ νηλέι χαλκῷ, ἢ κατὰ πετράων βαλέειν ἐρύσαντας ἐπʼ ἄκρης, ἢ ἐάαν μέγʼ ἄγαλμα θεῶν θελκτήριον εἶναι, τῇ περ δὴ καὶ ἔπειτα τελευτήσεσθαι ἔμελλεν· αἶσα γὰρ ἦν ἀπολέσθαι, ἐπὴν πόλις ἀμφικαλύψῃ δουράτεον μέγαν ἵππον, ὅθʼ ἥατο πάντες ἄριστοι Ἀργείων Τρώεσσι φόνον καὶ κῆρα φέροντες. ἤειδεν δʼ ὡς ἄστυ διέπραθον υἷες Ἀχαιῶν ἱππόθεν ἐκχύμενοι, κοῖλον λόχον ἐκπρολιπόντες. ἄλλον δʼ ἄλλῃ ἄειδε πόλιν κεραϊζέμεν αἰπήν, αὐτὰρ Ὀδυσσῆα προτὶ δώματα Δηιφόβοιο βήμεναι, ἠύτʼ Ἄρηα σὺν ἀντιθέῳ Μενελάῳ. κεῖθι δὴ αἰνότατον πόλεμον φάτο τολμήσαντα νικῆσαι καὶ ἔπειτα διὰ μεγάθυμον Ἀθήνην.
All this he told, but Odysseus was overcome as he heard him, and his cheeks were wet with tears. He wept as a woman weeps when she throws herself on the body of her husband who has fallen before his own city and people, fighting bravely in defense of his home and children. She screams aloud and flings her arms about him as he lies gasping for breath and dying, but her enemies beat her from behind about the back and shoulders, and carry her off into slavery, to a life of labor   and sorrow, and the beauty fades from her cheeks - even so piteously did Odysseus weep, but none of those present perceived his tears except Alkinoos, who was sitting near him, and could hear the sobs and sighs that he was heaving. The king, therefore, at once rose and said:	ταῦτʼ ἄρʼ ἀοιδὸς ἄειδε περικλυτός· αὐτὰρ Ὀδυσσεὺς τήκετο, δάκρυ δʼ ἔδευεν ὑπὸ βλεφάροισι παρειάς. ὡς δὲ γυνὴ κλαίῃσι φίλον πόσιν ἀμφιπεσοῦσα, ὅς τε ἑῆς πρόσθεν πόλιος λαῶν τε πέσῃσιν, ἄστεϊ καὶ τεκέεσσιν ἀμύνων νηλεὲς ἦμαρ· ἡ μὲν τὸν θνήσκοντα καὶ ἀσπαίροντα ἰδοῦσα ἀμφʼ αὐτῷ χυμένη λίγα κωκύει· οἱ δέ τʼ ὄπισθε κόπτοντες δούρεσσι μετάφρενον ἠδὲ καὶ ὤμους εἴρερον εἰσανάγουσι, πόνον τʼ ἐχέμεν καὶ ὀιζύν· τῆς δʼ ἐλεεινοτάτῳ ἄχεϊ φθινύθουσι παρειαί· ὣς Ὀδυσεὺς ἐλεεινὸν ὑπʼ ὀφρύσι δάκρυον εἶβεν. ἔνθʼ ἄλλους μὲν πάντας ἐλάνθανε δάκρυα λείβων, Ἀλκίνοος δέ μιν οἶος ἐπεφράσατʼ ἠδʼ ἐνόησεν, ἥμενος ἄγχʼ αὐτοῦ, βαρὺ δὲ στενάχοντος ἄκουσεν. αἶψα δὲ Φαιήκεσσι φιληρέτμοισι μετηύδα·
"""Aldermen and town councilors of the Phaeacians, let Demodokos cease his song, for there are those present who do not seem to like it. From the moment that we had done supper and Demodokos began to sing, our guest has been all the time groaning and lamenting. He is evidently in great distress  , so let the bard leave off, that we may all enjoy ourselves, hosts and guest alike. This will be much more as it should be, for all these festivities, with the escort and the presents that we are making with so much good will, are wholly in his honor, and any one with even a moderate amount of right feeling knows that he ought to treat a guest and a suppliant as though he were his own brother."	κέκλυτε, Φαιήκων ἡγήτορες ἠδὲ μέδοντες, Δημόδοκος δʼ ἤδη σχεθέτω φόρμιγγα λίγειαν· οὐ γάρ πως πάντεσσι χαριζόμενος τάδʼ ἀείδει. ἐξ οὗ δορπέομέν τε καὶ ὤρορε θεῖος ἀοιδός, ἐκ τοῦ δʼ οὔ πω παύσατʼ ὀιζυροῖο γόοιο ὁ ξεῖνος· μάλα πού μιν ἄχος φρένας ἀμφιβέβηκεν. ἀλλʼ ἄγʼ ὁ μὲν σχεθέτω, ἵνʼ ὁμῶς τερπώμεθα πάντες, ξεινοδόκοι καὶ ξεῖνος, ἐπεὶ πολὺ κάλλιον οὕτως· εἵνεκα γὰρ ξείνοιο τάδʼ αἰδοίοιο τέτυκται, πομπὴ καὶ φίλα δῶρα, τά οἱ δίδομεν φιλέοντες. ἀντὶ κασιγνήτου ξεῖνός θʼ ἱκέτης τε τέτυκται ἀνέρι, ὅς τʼ ὀλίγον περ ἐπιψαύῃ πραπίδεσσι.
"""Therefore, sir, do you on your part affect no more concealment nor reserve in the matter about which I shall ask you; it will be more polite in you to give me a plain answer; tell me the name by which your father and mother over yonder used to call you, and by which you were known among your neighbors and fellow-citizens. There is no one, neither rich nor poor, who is absolutely without any name whatever, for people's fathers and mothers give them names as soon as they are born. Tell me also your country, nation , and city, that our ships may shape their purpose accordingly and take you there. For the Phaeacians have no pilots; their vessels have no rudders as those of other nations have, but the ships themselves understand what it is that we are thinking about and want; they know all the cities and countries in the whole world, and can traverse the sea just as well even when it is covered with mist and cloud, so that there is no danger of being wrecked or coming to any harm. Still I do remember hearing my father say that Poseidon was angry with us for being too easy-going in the matter of giving people escorts. He said that one of these days he should wreck a ship of ours as it was returning from having escorted some one, and envelop our city with a high mountain. This is what the old man used to say, but whether the god will carry out his threat or no is a matter which he will decide for himself."	τῷ νῦν μηδὲ σὺ κεῦθε νοήμασι κερδαλέοισιν ὅττι κέ σʼ εἴρωμαι· φάσθαι δέ σε κάλλιόν ἐστιν. εἴπʼ ὄνομʼ ὅττι σε κεῖθι κάλεον μήτηρ τε πατήρ τε ἄλλοι θʼ οἳ κατὰ ἄστυ καὶ οἳ περιναιετάουσιν. οὐ μὲν γάρ τις πάμπαν ἀνώνυμός ἐστʼ ἀνθρώπων, οὐ κακὸς οὐδὲ μὲν ἐσθλός, ἐπὴν τὰ πρῶτα γένηται, ἀλλʼ ἐπὶ πᾶσι τίθενται, ἐπεί κε τέκωσι, τοκῆες. εἰπὲ δέ μοι γαῖάν τε· τεὴν δῆμόν τε πόλιν τε, ὄφρα σε τῇ πέμπωσι τιτυσκόμεναι φρεσὶ νῆες· οὐ γὰρ Φαιήκεσσι κυβερνητῆρες ἔασιν, οὐδέ τι πηδάλιʼ ἔστι, τά τʼ ἄλλαι νῆες ἔχουσιν· ἀλλʼ αὐταὶ ἴσασι νοήματα καὶ φρένας ἀνδρῶν, καὶ πάντων ἴσασι πόλιας καὶ πίονας ἀγροὺς ἀνθρώπων, καὶ λαῖτμα τάχισθʼ ἁλὸς ἐκπερόωσιν ἠέρι καὶ νεφέλῃ κεκαλυμμέναι· οὐδέ ποτέ σφιν οὔτε τι πημανθῆναι ἔπι δέος οὔτʼ ἀπολέσθαι. ἀλλὰ τόδʼ ὥς ποτε πατρὸς ἐγὼν εἰπόντος ἄκουσα Ναυσιθόου, ὃς ἔφασκε Ποσειδάωνʼ ἀγάσασθαι ἡμῖν, οὕνεκα πομποὶ ἀπήμονές εἰμεν ἁπάντων. φῆ ποτὲ Φαιήκων ἀνδρῶν ἐυεργέα νῆα ἐκ πομπῆς ἀνιοῦσαν ἐν ἠεροειδέι πόντῳ ῥαισέμεναι, μέγα δʼ ἧμιν ὄρος πόλει ἀμφικαλύψειν. ὣς ἀγόρευʼ ὁ γέρων· τὰ δέ κεν θεὸς ἢ τελέσειεν ἤ κʼ ἀτέλεστʼ εἴη, ὥς οἱ φίλον ἔπλετο θυμῷ·
"And now, tell me and tell me true. Where have you been wandering, and in what countries have you traveled? Tell us of the peoples themselves, and of their cities - who were hostile, savage and uncivilized not , and who, on the other hand, hospitable and endowed with a god-fearing . Tell us also why you are made unhappy on hearing about the return of the Argive Danaans from Troy . The gods arranged all this, and sent them their misfortunes in order that future generations might have something to sing about. Did you lose some brave kinsman of your wife's when you were before Troy ? A son-in-law or father-in-law - which are the nearest relations a man has outside his own flesh and blood? Or was it some brave and kindly-natured comrade - for a good friend is as dear to a man as his own brother?"""	ἀλλʼ ἄγε μοι τόδε εἰπὲ καὶ ἀτρεκέως κατάλεξον, ὅππῃ ἀπεπλάγχθης τε καὶ ἅς τινας ἵκεο χώρας ἀνθρώπων, αὐτούς τε πόλιάς τʼ ἐὺ ναιετοώσας, ἠμὲν ὅσοι χαλεποί τε καὶ ἄγριοι οὐδὲ δίκαιοι, οἵ τε φιλόξεινοι, καί σφιν νόος ἐστὶ θεουδής. εἰπὲ δʼ ὅ τι κλαίεις καὶ ὀδύρεαι ἔνδοθι θυμῷ Ἀργείων Δαναῶν ἠδʼ Ἰλίου οἶτον ἀκούων. τὸν δὲ θεοὶ μὲν τεῦξαν, ἐπεκλώσαντο δʼ ὄλεθρον ἀνθρώποις, ἵνα ᾖσι καὶ ἐσσομένοισιν ἀοιδή. ἦ τίς τοι καὶ πηὸς ἀπέφθιτο Ἰλιόθι πρὸ ἐσθλὸς ἐών, γαμβρὸς ἢ πενθερός, οἵ τε μάλιστα κήδιστοι τελέθουσι μεθʼ αἷμά τε καὶ γένος αὐτῶν; ἦ τίς που καὶ ἑταῖρος ἀνὴρ κεχαρισμένα εἰδώς, ἐσθλός; ἐπεὶ οὐ μέν τι κασιγνήτοιο χερείων
"And Odysseus answered, ""King Alkinoos, it is a good thing to hear a bard with such a divine voice as this man has. There is nothing better or more delightful than when merriment   prevails over a whole , with the guests sitting orderly to listen, while the table is loaded with bread and meats, and the cup-bearer draws wine and fills his cup for every man. This is indeed as fair a sight as a man can see. Now, however, since you are inclined to ask the story of my sorrows, and rekindle my own sad memories in respect of them, I do not know how to begin, nor yet how to continue and conclude my tale, for the hand of heaven has been laid heavily upon me."	τὸν δʼ ἀπαμειβόμενος προσέφη πολύμητις Ὀδυσσεύς· Ἀλκίνοε κρεῖον, πάντων ἀριδείκετε λαῶν, ἦ τοι μὲν τόδε καλὸν ἀκουέμεν ἐστὶν ἀοιδοῦ τοιοῦδʼ οἷος ὅδʼ ἐστί, θεοῖς ἐναλίγκιος αὐδήν. οὐ γὰρ ἐγώ γέ τί φημι τέλος χαριέστερον εἶναι ἢ ὅτʼ ἐυφροσύνη μὲν ἔχῃ κάτα δῆμον ἅπαντα, δαιτυμόνες δʼ ἀνὰ δώματʼ ἀκουάζωνται ἀοιδοῦ ἥμενοι ἑξείης, παρὰ δὲ πλήθωσι τράπεζαι σίτου καὶ κρειῶν, μέθυ δʼ ἐκ κρητῆρος ἀφύσσων οἰνοχόος φορέῃσι καὶ ἐγχείῃ δεπάεσσι· τοῦτό τί μοι κάλλιστον ἐνὶ φρεσὶν εἴδεται εἶναι. σοὶ δʼ ἐμὰ κήδεα θυμὸς ἐπετράπετο στονόεντα εἴρεσθʼ, ὄφρʼ ἔτι μᾶλλον ὀδυρόμενος στεναχίζω· τί πρῶτόν τοι ἔπειτα, τί δʼ ὑστάτιον καταλέξω; κήδεʼ ἐπεί μοι πολλὰ δόσαν θεοὶ Οὐρανίωνες.
"""Firstly, then, I will tell you my name that you too may know it, and that one day, if I outlive this time of sorrow, I may become a guest-friend to you, though I live so far away from all of you. I am Odysseus son of Laertes , renowned among humankind for all manner of subtlety, so that my ascends to heaven. I live in Ithaca , where there is a high mountain called Neritum, covered with forests; and not far from it there is a group of islands very near to one another - Dulichium, Same, and the wooded island of Zacynthus . It lies squat on the horizon, all highest up in the sea towards the sunset, while the others lie away from it towards dawn. It is a rugged island, but it breeds brave men, and my eyes know none that they better love to look upon. The goddess Calypso kept me with her in her cave, and wanted me to marry her, as did also the cunning Aeaean goddess Circe; but they could neither of them persuade me, for there is nothing dearer to a man than his own country and his parents, and however splendid a home he may have in a foreign country, if it be far from father or mother, he does not care about it. Now, however, I will tell you of the many hazardous adventures which by Zeus’ will I met with on my return   from Troy ."	νῦν δʼ ὄνομα πρῶτον μυθήσομαι, ὄφρα καὶ ὑμεῖς εἴδετʼ, ἐγὼ δʼ ἂν ἔπειτα φυγὼν ὕπο νηλεὲς ἦμαρ ὑμῖν ξεῖνος ἔω καὶ ἀπόπροθι δώματα ναίων. εἴμʼ Ὀδυσεὺς Λαερτιάδης, ὃς πᾶσι δόλοισιν ἀνθρώποισι μέλω, καί μευ κλέος οὐρανὸν ἵκει. ναιετάω δʼ Ἰθάκην ἐυδείελον· ἐν δʼ ὄρος αὐτῇ Νήριτον εἰνοσίφυλλον, ἀριπρεπές· ἀμφὶ δὲ νῆσοι πολλαὶ ναιετάουσι μάλα σχεδὸν ἀλλήλῃσι, Δουλίχιόν τε Σάμη τε καὶ ὑλήεσσα Ζάκυνθος. αὐτὴ δὲ χθαμαλὴ πανυπερτάτη εἰν ἁλὶ κεῖται πρὸς ζόφον, αἱ δέ τʼ ἄνευθε πρὸς ἠῶ τʼ ἠέλιόν τε, τρηχεῖʼ, ἀλλʼ ἀγαθὴ κουροτρόφος· οὔ τοι ἐγώ γε ἧς γαίης δύναμαι γλυκερώτερον ἄλλο ἰδέσθαι. ἦ μέν μʼ αὐτόθʼ ἔρυκε Καλυψώ, δῖα θεάων, ἐν σπέσσι γλαφυροῖσι, λιλαιομένη πόσιν εἶναι· ὣς δʼ αὔτως Κίρκη κατερήτυεν ἐν μεγάροισιν Αἰαίη δολόεσσα, λιλαιομένη πόσιν εἶναι· ἀλλʼ ἐμὸν οὔ ποτε θυμὸν ἐνὶ στήθεσσιν ἔπειθον. ὣς οὐδὲν γλύκιον ἧς πατρίδος οὐδὲ τοκήων γίγνεται, εἴ περ καί τις ἀπόπροθι πίονα οἶκον γαίῃ ἐν ἀλλοδαπῇ ναίει ἀπάνευθε τοκήων. εἰ δʼ ἄγε τοι καὶ νόστον ἐμὸν πολυκηδέʼ ἐνίσπω, ὅν μοι Ζεὺς ἐφέηκεν ἀπὸ Τροίηθεν ἰόντι.
"""When I had set sail thence the wind took me first to Ismaros, which is the city of the Kikones. There I sacked the town and put the people to the sword. We took their wives and also much booty, which we divided equitably amongst us, so that none might have reason to complain. I then said that we had better make off at once, but my men very foolishly would not obey me, so they stayed there drinking much wine and killing great numbers of sheep and oxen on the sea shore. Meanwhile the Kikones cried out for help to other Kikones who lived inland. These were more in number, and stronger, and they were more skilled in the art of war, for they could fight, either from chariots or on foot as the occasion served; in the morning, therefore, they came as thick as leaves and bloom in summertime  , and the hand of heaven was against us, so that we were hard pressed. They set the battle in array near the ships, and the hosts aimed their bronze-shod spears at one another. So long as the day waxed and it was still morning, we held our own against them, though they were more in number than we; but as the sun went down, towards the time when men loose their oxen, the Kikones got the better of us, and we lost half a dozen men from every ship we had; so we got away with those that were left."

"""Thence we sailed onward with sorrow in our hearts, but glad to have escaped death though we had lost our comrades, nor did we leave till we had thrice invoked each one of the poor men who had perished by the hands of the Kikones. Then Zeus raised the North wind against us till it blew a blast of wind, so that land and sky were hidden in thick clouds, and night sprang forth out of the heavens. We let the ships run before the gale, but the force of the wind tore our sails to tatters, so we took them down for fear of shipwreck, and rowed our hardest towards the land. There we lay two days and two nights suffering much alike from toil and distress of mind, but on the morning of the third day we again raised our masts, set sail, and took our places, letting the wind and steersmen direct our ship. I should have got home at that time unharmed had not the North wind and the currents been against me as I was doubling Cape Malea, and set me off my course hard by the island of Cythera ."	ἔνθεν δὲ προτέρω πλέομεν ἀκαχήμενοι ἦτορ, ἄσμενοι ἐκ θανάτοιο, φίλους ὀλέσαντες ἑταίρους. οὐδʼ ἄρα μοι προτέρω νῆες κίον ἀμφιέλισσαι, πρίν τινα τῶν δειλῶν ἑτάρων τρὶς ἕκαστον ἀῦσαι, οἳ θάνον ἐν πεδίῳ Κικόνων ὕπο δῃωθέντες. νηυσὶ δʼ ἐπῶρσʼ ἄνεμον Βορέην νεφεληγερέτα Ζεὺς λαίλαπι θεσπεσίῃ, σὺν δὲ νεφέεσσι κάλυψε γαῖαν ὁμοῦ καὶ πόντον· ὀρώρει δʼ οὐρανόθεν νύξ. αἱ μὲν ἔπειτʼ ἐφέροντʼ ἐπικάρσιαι, ἱστία δέ σφιν τριχθά τε καὶ τετραχθὰ διέσχισεν ἲς ἀνέμοιο. καὶ τὰ μὲν ἐς νῆας κάθεμεν, δείσαντες ὄλεθρον, αὐτὰς δʼ ἐσσυμένως προερέσσαμεν ἤπειρόνδε. ἔνθα δύω νύκτας δύο τʼ ἤματα συνεχὲς αἰεὶ κείμεθʼ, ὁμοῦ καμάτῳ τε καὶ ἄλγεσι θυμὸν ἔδοντες. ἀλλʼ ὅτε δὴ τρίτον ἦμαρ ἐυπλόκαμος τέλεσʼ Ἠώς, ἱστοὺς στησάμενοι ἀνά θʼ ἱστία λεύκʼ ἐρύσαντες ἥμεθα, τὰς δʼ ἄνεμός τε κυβερνῆταί τʼ ἴθυνον. καί νύ κεν ἀσκηθὴς ἱκόμην ἐς πατρίδα γαῖαν· ἀλλά με κῦμα ῥόος τε περιγνάμπτοντα Μάλειαν καὶ Βορέης ἀπέωσε, παρέπλαγξεν δὲ Κυθήρων.
"""I was driven thence by foul winds for a space of nine days upon the sea, but on the tenth day we reached the land of the Lotus-eaters, who live on a food that comes from a kind of flower. Here we landed to take in fresh water, and our crews got their mid-day meal on the shore near the ships. When they had eaten and drunk I chose   two of my company to go see what manner of men the people of the place might be, and they had a third man under them. They started at once, and went about among the Lotus-eaters, who did them no harm, but gave them to eat of the lotus, which was so delicious that those who ate of it left off caring about home, and did not even want to go back and say what had happened to them, but were for staying and munching lotus with the Lotus-eaters without thinking further of their ; nevertheless, though they wept bitterly I forced them back to the ships and made them fast under the benches. Then I told the rest to go on board at once, lest any of them should taste of the lotus and leave off wanting to achieve a homecoming  , so they took their places and smote the gray sea with their oars."	ἔνθεν δʼ ἐννῆμαρ φερόμην ὀλοοῖς ἀνέμοισιν πόντον ἐπʼ ἰχθυόεντα· ἀτὰρ δεκάτῃ ἐπέβημεν γαίης Λωτοφάγων, οἵ τʼ ἄνθινον εἶδαρ ἔδουσιν. ἔνθα δʼ ἐπʼ ἠπείρου βῆμεν καὶ ἀφυσσάμεθʼ ὕδωρ, αἶψα δὲ δεῖπνον ἕλοντο θοῇς παρὰ νηυσὶν ἑταῖροι. αὐτὰρ ἐπεὶ σίτοιό τʼ ἐπασσάμεθʼ ἠδὲ ποτῆτος, δὴ τοτʼ ἐγὼν ἑτάρους προΐειν πεύθεσθαι ἰόντας, οἵ τινες ἀνέρες εἶεν ἐπὶ χθονὶ σῖτον ἔδοντες ἄνδρε δύω κρίνας, τρίτατον κήρυχʼ ἅμʼ ὀπάσσας. οἱ δʼ αἶψʼ οἰχόμενοι μίγεν ἀνδράσι Λωτοφάγοισιν· οὐδʼ ἄρα Λωτοφάγοι μήδονθʼ ἑτάροισιν ὄλεθρον ἡμετέροις, ἀλλά σφι δόσαν λωτοῖο πάσασθαι. τῶν δʼ ὅς τις λωτοῖο φάγοι μελιηδέα καρπόν, οὐκέτʼ ἀπαγγεῖλαι πάλιν ἤθελεν οὐδὲ νέεσθαι, ἀλλʼ αὐτοῦ βούλοντο μετʼ ἀνδράσι Λωτοφάγοισι λωτὸν ἐρεπτόμενοι μενέμεν νόστου τε λαθέσθαι. τοὺς μὲν ἐγὼν ἐπὶ νῆας ἄγον κλαίοντας ἀνάγκῃ, νηυσὶ δʼ ἐνὶ γλαφυρῇσιν ὑπὸ ζυγὰ δῆσα ἐρύσσας. αὐτὰρ τοὺς ἄλλους κελόμην ἐρίηρας ἑταίρους σπερχομένους νηῶν ἐπιβαινέμεν ὠκειάων, μή πώς τις λωτοῖο φαγὼν νόστοιο λάθηται. οἱ δʼ αἶψʼ εἴσβαινον καὶ ἐπὶ κληῖσι καθῖζον, ἑξῆς δʼ ἑζόμενοι πολιὴν ἅλα τύπτον ἐρετμοῖς.

They have no laws nor assemblies of the people, but live in caves on the tops of high mountains; each is lord and master in his family, and they take no account of their neighbors."	ἔνθεν δὲ προτέρω πλέομεν ἀκαχήμενοι ἦτορ· Κυκλώπων δʼ ἐς γαῖαν ὑπερφιάλων ἀθεμίστων ἱκόμεθʼ, οἵ ῥα θεοῖσι πεποιθότες ἀθανάτοισιν οὔτε φυτεύουσιν χερσὶν φυτὸν οὔτʼ ἀρόωσιν, ἀλλὰ τά γʼ ἄσπαρτα καὶ ἀνήροτα πάντα φύονται, πυροὶ καὶ κριθαὶ ἠδʼ ἄμπελοι, αἵ τε φέρουσιν οἶνον ἐριστάφυλον, καί σφιν Διὸς ὄμβρος ἀέξει. τοῖσιν δʼ οὔτʼ ἀγοραὶ βουληφόροι οὔτε θέμιστες, ἀλλʼ οἵ γʼ ὑψηλῶν ὀρέων ναίουσι κάρηνα ἐν σπέσσι γλαφυροῖσι, θεμιστεύει δὲ ἕκαστος παίδων ἠδʼ ἀλόχων, οὐδʼ ἀλλήλων ἀλέγουσιν.

It is overrun with wild goats, that breed there in great numbers and are never disturbed by foot of man; for sportsmen - who as a rule will suffer so much hardship in forest or among mountain precipices - do not go there, nor yet again is it ever ploughed or fed down, but it lies a wilderness untilled and unsown from year to year, and has no living thing upon it but only goats. For the Cyclopes have no ships, nor yet shipwrights who could make ships for them; they cannot therefore go from city to city, or sail over the sea to one another's country as people who have ships can do; if they had had these they would have colonized the island, for it is a very good one, and would yield everything in due season. There are meadows that in some places come right down to the sea shore, well watered and full of luscious grass; grapes would do there excellently; there is level land for ploughing, and it would always yield heavily at harvest time  , for the soil is deep. There is a good harbor where no cables are wanted, nor yet anchors, nor need a ship be moored, but all one has to do is to beach one's vessel and stay there till the wind becomes fair for putting out to sea again. At the head of the harbor there is a spring of clear water coming out of a cave, and there are poplars growing all round it."	νῆσος ἔπειτα λάχεια παρὲκ λιμένος τετάνυσται, γαίης Κυκλώπων οὔτε σχεδὸν οὔτʼ ἀποτηλοῦ, ὑλήεσσʼ· ἐν δʼ αἶγες ἀπειρέσιαι γεγάασιν ἄγριαι· οὐ μὲν γὰρ πάτος ἀνθρώπων ἀπερύκει, οὐδέ μιν εἰσοιχνεῦσι κυνηγέται, οἵ τε καθʼ ὕλην ἄλγεα πάσχουσιν κορυφὰς ὀρέων ἐφέποντες. οὔτʼ ἄρα ποίμνῃσιν καταΐσχεται οὔτʼ ἀρότοισιν, ἀλλʼ ἥ γʼ ἄσπαρτος καὶ ἀνήροτος ἤματα πάντα ἀνδρῶν χηρεύει, βόσκει δέ τε μηκάδας αἶγας. οὐ γὰρ Κυκλώπεσσι νέες πάρα μιλτοπάρῃοι, οὐδʼ ἄνδρες νηῶν ἔνι τέκτονες, οἵ κε κάμοιεν νῆας ἐυσσέλμους, αἵ κεν τελέοιεν ἕκαστα ἄστεʼ ἐπʼ ἀνθρώπων ἱκνεύμεναι, οἷά τε πολλὰ ἄνδρες ἐπʼ ἀλλήλους νηυσὶν περόωσι θάλασσαν· οἵ κέ σφιν καὶ νῆσον ἐυκτιμένην ἐκάμοντο. οὐ μὲν γάρ τι κακή γε, φέροι δέ κεν ὥρια πάντα· ἐν μὲν γὰρ λειμῶνες ἁλὸς πολιοῖο παρʼ ὄχθας ὑδρηλοὶ μαλακοί· μάλα κʼ ἄφθιτοι ἄμπελοι εἶεν. ἐν δʼ ἄροσις λείη· μάλα κεν βαθὺ λήιον αἰεὶ εἰς ὥρας ἀμῷεν, ἐπεὶ μάλα πῖαρ ὑπʼ οὖδας. ἐν δὲ λιμὴν ἐύορμος, ἵνʼ οὐ χρεὼ πείσματός ἐστιν, οὔτʼ εὐνὰς βαλέειν οὔτε πρυμνήσιʼ ἀνάψαι, ἀλλʼ ἐπικέλσαντας μεῖναι χρόνον εἰς ὅ κε ναυτέων θυμὸς ἐποτρύνῃ καὶ ἐπιπνεύσωσιν ἀῆται. αὐτὰρ ἐπὶ κρατὸς λιμένος ῥέει ἀγλαὸν ὕδωρ, κρήνη ὑπὸ σπείους· περὶ δʼ αἴγειροι πεφύασιν.
"""Here we entered, but so dark was the night that some god must have brought us in, for there was nothing whatever to be seen. A thick mist hung all round our ships; the moon was hidden behind a mass of clouds so that no one could have seen the island if he had looked for it, nor were there any breakers to tell us we were close in shore before we found ourselves upon the land itself; when, however, we had beached the ships, we took down the sails, went ashore and camped upon the beach till daybreak."	ἔνθα κατεπλέομεν, καί τις θεὸς ἡγεμόνευεν νύκτα διʼ ὀρφναίην, οὐδὲ προυφαίνετʼ ἰδέσθαι· ἀὴρ γὰρ περὶ νηυσὶ βαθεῖʼ ἦν, οὐδὲ σελήνη οὐρανόθεν προύφαινε, κατείχετο δὲ νεφέεσσιν. ἔνθʼ οὔ τις τὴν νῆσον ἐσέδρακεν ὀφθαλμοῖσιν, οὔτʼ οὖν κύματα μακρὰ κυλινδόμενα προτὶ χέρσον εἰσίδομεν, πρὶν νῆας ἐυσσέλμους ἐπικέλσαι. κελσάσῃσι δὲ νηυσὶ καθείλομεν ἱστία πάντα, ἐκ δὲ καὶ αὐτοὶ βῆμεν ἐπὶ ῥηγμῖνι θαλάσσης· ἔνθα δʼ ἀποβρίξαντες ἐμείναμεν Ἠῶ δῖαν.
"""When the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared, we admired the island and wandered all over it, while the nymphs, Zeus’ daughters, roused the wild goats that we might get some meat for our dinner. On this we fetched our spears and bows and arrows from the ships, and dividing ourselves into three bands began to shoot the goats. Heaven sent us excellent sport; I had twelve ships with me, and each ship got nine goats, while my own ship had ten; thus through the livelong day to the going down of the sun we ate and drank our fill, - and we had plenty of wine left, for each one of us had taken many jars full when we sacked the city of the Kikones, and this had not yet run out. While we were feasting we kept turning our eyes towards the land of the Cyclopes, which was hard by, and saw the smoke of their stubble fires. We could almost fancy we heard their voices and the bleating of their sheep and goats, but when the sun went down and it came on dark, we camped down upon the beach, and next morning I called a council."	ἦμος δʼ ἠριγένεια φάνη ῥοδοδάκτυλος Ἠώς, νῆσον θαυμάζοντες ἐδινεόμεσθα κατʼ αὐτήν. ὦρσαν δὲ νύμφαι, κοῦραι Διὸς αἰγιόχοιο, αἶγας ὀρεσκῴους, ἵνα δειπνήσειαν ἑταῖροι. αὐτίκα καμπύλα τόξα καὶ αἰγανέας δολιχαύλους εἱλόμεθʼ ἐκ νηῶν, διὰ δὲ τρίχα κοσμηθέντες βάλλομεν· αἶψα δʼ ἔδωκε θεὸς μενοεικέα θήρην. νῆες μέν μοι ἕποντο δυώδεκα, ἐς δὲ ἑκάστην ἐννέα λάγχανον αἶγες· ἐμοὶ δὲ δέκʼ ἔξελον οἴῳ. ὣς τότε μὲν πρόπαν ἦμαρ ἐς ἠέλιον καταδύντα ἥμεθα δαινύμενοι κρέα τʼ ἄσπετα καὶ μέθυ ἡδύ· οὐ γάρ πω νηῶν ἐξέφθιτο οἶνος ἐρυθρός, ἀλλʼ ἐνέην· πολλὸν γὰρ ἐν ἀμφιφορεῦσιν ἕκαστοι ἠφύσαμεν Κικόνων. ἱερὸν πτολίεθρον ἑλόντες.

"""I went on board, bidding my men to do so also and loose the hawsers; so they took their places and smote the gray sea with their oars. When we got to the land, which was not far, there, on the face of a cliff near the sea, we saw a great cave overhung with laurels. It was a station for a great many sheep and goats, and outside there was a large yard, with a high wall round it made of stones built into the ground and of trees both pine and oak. This was the abode of a huge monster who was then away from home shepherding his flocks. He would have nothing to do with other people, but led the life of an outlaw. He was a horrid creature, not like a human being at all, but resembling rather some crag that stands out boldly against the sky on the top of a high mountain."	ὣς εἰπὼν ἀνὰ νηὸς ἔβην, ἐκέλευσα δʼ ἑταίρους αὐτούς τʼ ἀμβαίνειν ἀνά τε πρυμνήσια λῦσαι. οἱ δʼ αἶψʼ εἴσβαινον καὶ ἐπὶ κληῖσι καθῖζον, ἑξῆς δʼ ἑζόμενοι πολιὴν ἅλα τύπτον ἐρετμοῖς. ἀλλʼ ὅτε δὴ τὸν χῶρον ἀφικόμεθʼ ἐγγὺς ἐόντα, ἔνθα δʼ ἐπʼ ἐσχατιῇ σπέος εἴδομεν ἄγχι θαλάσσης, ὑψηλόν, δάφνῃσι κατηρεφές. ἔνθα δὲ πολλὰ μῆλʼ, ὄιές τε καὶ αἶγες, ἰαύεσκον· περὶ δʼ αὐλὴ ὑψηλὴ δέδμητο κατωρυχέεσσι λίθοισι μακρῇσίν τε πίτυσσιν ἰδὲ δρυσὶν ὑψικόμοισιν. ἔνθα δʼ ἀνὴρ ἐνίαυε πελώριος, ὅς ῥα τὰ μῆλα οἶος ποιμαίνεσκεν ἀπόπροθεν· οὐδὲ μετʼ ἄλλους πωλεῖτʼ, ἀλλʼ ἀπάνευθεν ἐὼν ἀθεμίστια ᾔδη. καὶ γὰρ θαῦμʼ ἐτέτυκτο πελώριον, οὐδὲ ἐῴκει ἀνδρί γε σιτοφάγῳ, ἀλλὰ ῥίῳ ὑλήεντι ὑψηλῶν ὀρέων, ὅ τε φαίνεται οἶον ἀπʼ ἄλλων.
"""I told my men to draw the ship ashore, and stay where they were, all but the twelve best   among them, who were to go along with myself. I also took a goatskin of sweet black wine which had been given me by Maron, Apollo son of Euanthes, who was priest of Apollo the patron god of Ismaros, and lived within the wooded precincts of the temple. When we were sacking the city we respected him, and spared his life, as also his wife and child; so he made me some presents of great value - seven talents of fine gold, and a bowl of silver, with twelve jars of sweet wine, unblended, and of the most exquisite flavor. Not a man nor maid in the house knew about it, but only himself, his wife, and one housekeeper: when he drank it he mixed twenty parts of water to one of wine, and yet the fragrance from the mixing-bowl was so exquisite that it was impossible to refrain from drinking. I filled a large skin with this wine, and took a wallet full of provisions with me, for my mind misgave me that I might have to deal with some savage who would be of great strength, and would respect neither right   nor law."	δὴ τότε τοὺς ἄλλους κελόμην ἐρίηρας ἑταίρους αὐτοῦ πὰρ νηί τε μένειν καὶ νῆα ἔρυσθαι, αὐτὰρ ἐγὼ κρίνας ἑτάρων δυοκαίδεκʼ ἀρίστους βῆν· ἀτὰρ αἴγεον ἀσκὸν ἔχον μέλανος οἴνοιο ἡδέος, ὅν μοι ἔδωκε Μάρων, Εὐάνθεος υἱός, ἱρεὺς Ἀπόλλωνος, ὃς Ἴσμαρον ἀμφιβεβήκει, οὕνεκά μιν σὺν παιδὶ περισχόμεθʼ ἠδὲ γυναικὶ ἁζόμενοι· ᾤκει γὰρ ἐν ἄλσεϊ δενδρήεντι Φοίβου Ἀπόλλωνος. ὁ δέ μοι πόρεν ἀγλαὰ δῶρα· χρυσοῦ μέν μοι ἔδωκʼ ἐυεργέος ἑπτὰ τάλαντα, δῶκε δέ μοι κρητῆρα πανάργυρον, αὐτὰρ ἔπειτα οἶνον ἐν ἀμφιφορεῦσι δυώδεκα πᾶσιν ἀφύσσας ἡδὺν ἀκηράσιον, θεῖον ποτόν· οὐδέ τις αὐτὸν ἠείδη δμώων οὐδʼ ἀμφιπόλων ἐνὶ οἴκῳ, ἀλλʼ αὐτὸς ἄλοχός τε φίλη ταμίη τε μίʼ οἴη. τὸν δʼ ὅτε πίνοιεν μελιηδέα οἶνον ἐρυθρόν, ἓν δέπας ἐμπλήσας ὕδατος ἀνὰ εἴκοσι μέτρα χεῦʼ, ὀδμὴ δʼ ἡδεῖα ἀπὸ κρητῆρος ὀδώδει θεσπεσίη· τότʼ ἂν οὔ τοι ἀποσχέσθαι φίλον ἦεν. τοῦ φέρον ἐμπλήσας ἀσκὸν μέγαν, ἐν δὲ καὶ ᾖα κωρύκῳ· αὐτίκα γάρ μοι ὀίσατο θυμὸς ἀγήνωρ ἄνδρʼ ἐπελεύσεσθαι μεγάλην ἐπιειμένον ἀλκήν, ἄγριον, οὔτε δίκας ἐὺ εἰδότα οὔτε θέμιστας.
"""We soon reached his cave, but he was out shepherding, so we went inside and took stock of all that we could see. His cheese-racks were loaded with cheeses, and he had more lambs and kids than his pens could hold. They were kept in separate flocks; first there were the hoggets, then the oldest of the younger lambs and lastly the very young ones all kept apart from one another; as for his dairy, all the vessels, bowls, and milk pails into which he milked, were swimming with whey. When they saw all this, my men begged me to let them first steal some cheeses, and make off with them to the ship; they would then return, drive down the lambs and kids, put them on board and sail away with them. It would have been indeed better if we had done so but I would not listen to them, for I wanted to see the owner himself, in the hope that he might give me a present. When, however, we saw him my poor men found him ill to deal with."	καρπαλίμως δʼ εἰς ἄντρον ἀφικόμεθʼ, οὐδέ μιν ἔνδον εὕρομεν, ἀλλʼ ἐνόμευε νομὸν κάτα πίονα μῆλα. ἐλθόντες δʼ εἰς ἄντρον ἐθηεύμεσθα ἕκαστα. ταρσοὶ μὲν τυρῶν βρῖθον, στείνοντο δὲ σηκοὶ ἀρνῶν ἠδʼ ἐρίφων· διακεκριμέναι δὲ ἕκασται ἔρχατο, χωρὶς μὲν πρόγονοι, χωρὶς δὲ μέτασσαι, χωρὶς δʼ αὖθʼ ἕρσαι. ναῖον δʼ ὀρῷ ἄγγεα πάντα, γαυλοί τε σκαφίδες τε, τετυγμένα, τοῖς ἐνάμελγεν. ἔνθʼ ἐμὲ μὲν πρώτισθʼ ἕταροι λίσσοντʼ ἐπέεσσιν τυρῶν αἰνυμένους ἰέναι πάλιν, αὐτὰρ ἔπειτα καρπαλίμως ἐπὶ νῆα θοὴν ἐρίφους τε καὶ ἄρνας σηκῶν ἐξελάσαντας ἐπιπλεῖν ἁλμυρὸν ὕδωρ· ἀλλʼ ἐγὼ οὐ πιθόμην, ἦ τʼ ἂν πολὺ κέρδιον ἦεν, ὄφρʼ αὐτόν τε ἴδοιμι, καὶ εἴ μοι ξείνια δοίη. οὐδʼ ἄρʼ ἔμελλʼ ἑτάροισι φανεὶς ἐρατεινὸς ἔσεσθαι.
"""We lit a fire, offered some of the cheeses in sacrifice, ate others of them, and then sat waiting till the Cyclops should come in with his sheep. When he came, he brought in with him a huge load of dry firewood to light the fire for his supper, and this he flung with such a noise on to the floor of his cave that we hid ourselves for fear at the far end of the cavern. Meanwhile he drove all the ewes inside, as well as the she-goats that he was going to milk, leaving the males, both rams and he-goats, outside in the yards. Then he rolled a huge stone to the mouth of the cave - so huge that two and twenty strong four-wheeled wagons would not be enough to draw it from its place against the doorway. When he had so done he sat down and milked his ewes and goats, all in due course, and then let each of them have her own young. He curdled half the milk and set it aside in wicker strainers, but the other half he poured into bowls that he might drink it for his supper. When he had got through with all his work, he lit the fire, and then caught sight of us, whereon he said:"	ἔνθα δὲ πῦρ κήαντες ἐθύσαμεν ἠδὲ καὶ αὐτοὶ τυρῶν αἰνύμενοι φάγομεν, μένομέν τέ μιν ἔνδον ἥμενοι, ἧος ἐπῆλθε νέμων. φέρε δʼ ὄβριμον ἄχθος ὕλης ἀζαλέης, ἵνα οἱ ποτιδόρπιον εἴη, ἔντοσθεν δʼ ἄντροιο βαλὼν ὀρυμαγδὸν ἔθηκεν· ἡμεῖς δὲ δείσαντες ἀπεσσύμεθʼ ἐς μυχὸν ἄντρου. αὐτὰρ ὅ γʼ εἰς εὐρὺ σπέος ἤλασε πίονα μῆλα πάντα μάλʼ ὅσσʼ ἤμελγε, τὰ δʼ ἄρσενα λεῖπε θύρηφιν, ἀρνειούς τε τράγους τε, βαθείης ἔκτοθεν αὐλῆς. αὐτὰρ ἔπειτʼ ἐπέθηκε θυρεὸν μέγαν ὑψόσʼ ἀείρας, ὄβριμον· οὐκ ἂν τόν γε δύω καὶ εἴκοσʼ ἄμαξαι ἐσθλαὶ τετράκυκλοι ἀπʼ οὔδεος ὀχλίσσειαν· τόσσην ἠλίβατον πέτρην ἐπέθηκε θύρῃσιν. ἑζόμενος δʼ ἤμελγεν ὄις καὶ μηκάδας αἶγας, πάντα κατὰ μοῖραν, καὶ ὑπʼ ἔμβρυον ἧκεν ἑκάστῃ. αὐτίκα δʼ ἥμισυ μὲν θρέψας λευκοῖο γάλακτος πλεκτοῖς ἐν ταλάροισιν ἀμησάμενος κατέθηκεν, ἥμισυ δʼ αὖτʼ ἔστησεν ἐν ἄγγεσιν, ὄφρα οἱ εἴη πίνειν αἰνυμένῳ καί οἱ ποτιδόρπιον εἴη. αὐτὰρ ἐπεὶ δὴ σπεῦσε πονησάμενος τὰ ἃ ἔργα, καὶ τότε πῦρ ἀνέκαιε καὶ εἴσιδεν, εἴρετο δʼ ἡμέας·

We therefore humbly pray you to show us some hospitality, and otherwise make us such presents as visitors may reasonably expect.

We Cyclopes do not care about Zeus or any of your blessed gods, for we are ever so much stronger than they. I shall not spare either yourself or your companions out of any regard for Zeus, unless I am in the humor for doing so. And now tell me where you made your ship fast when you came on shore.

"""The cruel wretch granted me not one word of answer, but with a sudden clutch he gripped up two of my men at once and dashed them down upon the ground as though they had been puppies. Their brains were shed upon the ground, and the earth was wet with their blood. Then he tore them limb from limb and supped upon them. He gobbled them up like a lion in the wilderness, flesh, bones, marrow, and entrails, without leaving anything uneaten. As for us, we wept and lifted up our hands to heaven on seeing such a horrid sight, for we did not know what else to do; but when the Cyclops had filled his huge paunch, and had washed down his meal of human flesh with a drink of neat milk, he stretched himself full length upon the ground among his sheep, and went to sleep. I was at first inclined to seize my sword, draw it, and drive it into his vitals, but I reflected that if I did we should all certainly be lost, for we should never be able to shift the stone which the monster had put in front of the door. So we stayed sobbing and sighing where we were till morning came."	ὣς ἐφάμην, ὁ δέ μʼ οὐδὲν ἀμείβετο νηλέι θυμῷ, ἀλλʼ ὅ γʼ ἀναΐξας ἑτάροις ἐπὶ χεῖρας ἴαλλε, σὺν δὲ δύω μάρψας ὥς τε σκύλακας ποτὶ γαίῃ κόπτʼ· ἐκ δʼ ἐγκέφαλος χαμάδις ῥέε, δεῦε δὲ γαῖαν. τοὺς δὲ διὰ μελεϊστὶ ταμὼν ὡπλίσσατο δόρπον· ἤσθιε δʼ ὥς τε λέων ὀρεσίτροφος, οὐδʼ ἀπέλειπεν, ἔγκατά τε σάρκας τε καὶ ὀστέα μυελόεντα. ἡμεῖς δὲ κλαίοντες ἀνεσχέθομεν Διὶ χεῖρας, σχέτλια ἔργʼ ὁρόωντες, ἀμηχανίη δʼ ἔχε θυμόν. αὐτὰρ ἐπεὶ Κύκλωψ μεγάλην ἐμπλήσατο νηδὺν ἀνδρόμεα κρέʼ ἔδων καὶ ἐπʼ ἄκρητον γάλα πίνων, κεῖτʼ ἔντοσθʼ ἄντροιο τανυσσάμενος διὰ μήλων. τὸν μὲν ἐγὼ βούλευσα κατὰ μεγαλήτορα θυμὸν ἆσσον ἰών, ξίφος ὀξὺ ἐρυσσάμενος παρὰ μηροῦ, οὐτάμεναι πρὸς στῆθος, ὅθι φρένες ἧπαρ ἔχουσι, χείρʼ ἐπιμασσάμενος· ἕτερος δέ με θυμὸς ἔρυκεν. αὐτοῦ γάρ κε καὶ ἄμμες ἀπωλόμεθʼ αἰπὺν ὄλεθρον· οὐ γάρ κεν δυνάμεσθα θυράων ὑψηλάων χερσὶν ἀπώσασθαι λίθον ὄβριμον, ὃν προσέθηκεν. ὣς τότε μὲν στενάχοντες ἐμείναμεν Ἠῶ δῖαν.
"""When the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared, he again lit his fire, milked his goats and ewes, all quite rightly, and then let each have her own young one; as soon as he had got through with all his work, he clutched up two more of my men, and began eating them for his morning's meal. Presently, with the utmost ease, he rolled the stone away from the door and drove out his sheep, but he at once put it back again - as easily as though he were merely clapping the lid on to a quiver full of arrows. As soon as he had done so he shouted, and cried ‘Shoo, shoo,’ after his sheep to drive them on to the mountain; so I was left to scheme some way of taking my revenge and covering myself with glory."	ἦμος δʼ ἠριγένεια φάνη ῥοδοδάκτυλος Ἠώς, καὶ τότε πῦρ ἀνέκαιε καὶ ἤμελγε κλυτὰ μῆλα, πάντα κατὰ μοῖραν, καὶ ὑπʼ ἔμβρυον ἧκεν ἑκάστῃ. αὐτὰρ ἐπεὶ δὴ σπεῦσε πονησάμενος τὰ ἃ ἔργα, σὺν δʼ ὅ γε δὴ αὖτε δύω μάρψας ὡπλίσσατο δεῖπνον. δειπνήσας δʼ ἄντρου ἐξήλασε πίονα μῆλα, ῥηιδίως ἀφελὼν θυρεὸν μέγαν· αὐτὰρ ἔπειτα ἂψ ἐπέθηχʼ, ὡς εἴ τε φαρέτρῃ πῶμʼ ἐπιθείη. πολλῇ δὲ ῥοίζῳ πρὸς ὄρος τρέπε πίονα μῆλα Κύκλωψ· αὐτὰρ ἐγὼ λιπόμην κακὰ βυσσοδομεύων, εἴ πως τισαίμην, δοίη δέ μοι εὖχος Ἀθήνη.
"""In the end I deemed it would be the best plan to do as follows. The Cyclops had a great club which was lying near one of the sheep pens; it was of green olive wood, and he had cut it intending to use it for a staff as soon as it should be dry. It was so huge that we could only compare it to the mast of a twenty-oared merchant vessel of large burden, and able to venture out into open sea. I went up to this club and cut off about six feet of it; I then gave this piece to the men and told them to fine it evenly off at one end, which they proceeded to do, and lastly I brought it to a point myself, charring the end in the fire to make it harder. When I had done this I hid it under dung, which was lying about all over the cave, and told the men to cast lots which of them should venture along with myself to lift it and bore it into the monster's eye while he was asleep. The lot fell upon the very four whom I should have chosen, and I myself made five. In the evening the wretch came back from shepherding, and drove his flocks into the cave - this time driving them all inside, and not leaving any in the yards; I suppose some fancy must have taken him, or a god must have prompted him to do so. As soon as he had put the stone back to its place against the door, he sat down, milked his ewes and his goats all quite rightly, and then let each have her own young one; when he had got through with all this work, he gripped up two more of my men, and made his supper off them. So I went up to him with an ivy-wood bowl of black wine in my hands:"	ἥδε δέ μοι κατὰ θυμὸν ἀρίστη φαίνετο βουλή.

"""‘Look here, Cyclops ,’ said I, 'you have been eating a great deal of man's flesh, so take this and drink some wine, that you may see what kind of liquor we had on board my ship. I was bringing it to you as a drink-offering, in the hope that you would take compassion upon me and further me on my way home, whereas all you do is to go on ramping and raving most intolerably. You ought to be ashamed yourself; how can you expect people to come see you any more if you treat them in this way?’"	Κύκλωψ, τῆ, πίε οἶνον, ἐπεὶ φάγες ἀνδρόμεα κρέα, ὄφρʼ εἰδῇς οἷόν τι ποτὸν τόδε νηῦς ἐκεκεύθει ἡμετέρη. σοὶ δʼ αὖ λοιβὴν φέρον, εἴ μʼ ἐλεήσας οἴκαδε πέμψειας· σὺ δὲ μαίνεαι οὐκέτʼ ἀνεκτῶς. σχέτλιε, πῶς κέν τίς σε καὶ ὕστερον ἄλλος ἵκοιτο ἀνθρώπων πολέων, ἐπεὶ οὐ κατὰ μοῖραν ἔρεξας;
"""He then took the cup and drank. He was so delighted with the taste of the wine that he begged me for another bowl full. ‘Be so kind,’ he said, ‘as to give me some more, and tell me your name at once. I want to make you a present that you will be glad to have. We have wine even in this country, for our soil grows grapes and the sun ripens them, but this drinks like nectar and ambrosia all in one.’"	ὣς ἐφάμην, ὁ δʼ ἔδεκτο καὶ ἔκπιεν· ἥσατο δʼ αἰνῶς ἡδὺ ποτὸν πίνων καὶ μʼ ᾔτεε δεύτερον αὖτις· δός μοι ἔτι πρόφρων, καί μοι τεὸν οὔνομα εἰπὲ αὐτίκα νῦν, ἵνα τοι δῶ ξείνιον, ᾧ κε σὺ χαίρῃς· καὶ γὰρ Κυκλώπεσσι φέρει ζείδωρος ἄρουρα οἶνον ἐριστάφυλον, καί σφιν Διὸς ὄμβρος ἀέξει· ἀλλὰ τόδʼ ἀμβροσίης καὶ νέκταρός ἐστιν ἀπορρώξ.
"""I then gave him some more; three times did I fill the bowl for him, and three times did he drain it without thought or heed; then, when I saw that the wine had got into his head, I said to him as plausibly as I could: ‘ Cyclops , you ask my name and I will tell it you; give me, therefore, the present you promised me; my name is Noman; this is what my father and mother and my friends have always called me.’"	ὣς φάτʼ, ἀτάρ οἱ αὖτις ἐγὼ πόρον αἴθοπα οἶνον. τρὶς μὲν ἔδωκα φέρων, τρὶς δʼ ἔκπιεν ἀφραδίῃσιν. αὐτὰρ ἐπεὶ Κύκλωπα περὶ φρένας ἤλυθεν οἶνος, καὶ τότε δή μιν ἔπεσσι προσηύδων μειλιχίοισι· Κύκλωψ, εἰρωτᾷς μʼ ὄνομα κλυτόν, αὐτὰρ ἐγώ τοι ἐξερέω· σὺ δέ μοι δὸς ξείνιον, ὥς περ ὑπέστης.

"""But the cruel wretch said, ‘Then I will eat all Noman's comrades before Noman himself, and will keep Noman for the last. This is the present that I will make him.’"	ὣς ἐφάμην, ὁ δέ μʼ αὐτίκʼ ἀμείβετο νηλέι θυμῷ· Οὖτιν ἐγὼ πύματον ἔδομαι μετὰ οἷς ἑτάροισιν, τοὺς δʼ ἄλλους πρόσθεν· τὸ δέ τοι ξεινήιον ἔσται.
As he spoke he reeled, and fell sprawling face upwards on the ground. His great neck hung heavily backwards and a deep sleep took hold upon him. Presently he turned sick, and threw up both wine and the gobbets of human flesh on which he had been gorging, for he was very drunk. Then I thrust the beam of wood far into the embers to heat it, and encouraged my men lest any of them should turn faint-hearted. When the wood, green though it was, was about to blaze, I drew it out of the fire glowing with heat, and my men gathered round me, for a had filled their hearts with courage. We drove the sharp end of the beam into the monster's eye, and bearing upon it with all my weight I kept turning it round and round as though I were boring a hole in a ship's plank with an auger, which two men with a wheel and strap can keep on turning as long as they choose. Even thus did we bore the red hot beam into his eye, till the boiling blood bubbled all over it as we worked it round and round, so that the steam from the burning eyeball scalded his eyelids and eyebrows, and the roots of the eye sputtered in the fire. As a blacksmith plunges an axe or hatchet into cold water to temper it - for it is this that gives strength to the iron - and it makes a great hiss as he does so, even thus did the Cyclops ’ eye hiss round the beam of olive wood, and his hideous yells made the cave ring again. We ran away in a fright, but he plucked the beam all besmirched with gore from his eye, and hurled it from him in a frenzy of rage and pain, shouting as he did so to the other Cyclopes who lived on the bleak headlands near him; so they gathered from all quarters round his cave when they heard him crying, and asked what was the matter with him.	ἦ καὶ ἀνακλινθεὶς πέσεν ὕπτιος, αὐτὰρ ἔπειτα κεῖτʼ ἀποδοχμώσας παχὺν αὐχένα, κὰδ δέ μιν ὕπνος ᾕρει πανδαμάτωρ· φάρυγος δʼ ἐξέσσυτο οἶνος ψωμοί τʼ ἀνδρόμεοι· ὁ δʼ ἐρεύγετο οἰνοβαρείων. καὶ τότʼ ἐγὼ τὸν μοχλὸν ὑπὸ σποδοῦ ἤλασα πολλῆς, ἧος θερμαίνοιτο· ἔπεσσι δὲ πάντας ἑταίρους θάρσυνον, μή τίς μοι ὑποδείσας ἀναδύη. ἀλλʼ ὅτε δὴ τάχʼ ὁ μοχλὸς ἐλάινος ἐν πυρὶ μέλλεν ἅψεσθαι, χλωρός περ ἐών, διεφαίνετο δʼ αἰνῶς, καὶ τότʼ ἐγὼν ἆσσον φέρον ἐκ πυρός, ἀμφὶ δʼ ἑταῖροι ἵσταντʼ· αὐτὰρ θάρσος ἐνέπνευσεν μέγα δαίμων. οἱ μὲν μοχλὸν ἑλόντες ἐλάινον, ὀξὺν ἐπʼ ἄκρῳ, ὀφθαλμῷ ἐνέρεισαν· ἐγὼ δʼ ἐφύπερθεν ἐρεισθεὶς δίνεον, ὡς ὅτε τις τρυπῷ δόρυ νήιον ἀνὴρ τρυπάνῳ, οἱ δέ τʼ ἔνερθεν ὑποσσείουσιν ἱμάντι ἁψάμενοι ἑκάτερθε, τὸ δὲ τρέχει ἐμμενὲς αἰεί. ὣς τοῦ ἐν ὀφθαλμῷ πυριήκεα μοχλὸν ἑλόντες δινέομεν, τὸν δʼ αἷμα περίρρεε θερμὸν ἐόντα. πάντα δέ οἱ βλέφαρʼ ἀμφὶ καὶ ὀφρύας εὗσεν ἀυτμὴ γλήνης καιομένης, σφαραγεῦντο δέ οἱ πυρὶ ῥίζαι. ὡς δʼ ὅτʼ ἀνὴρ χαλκεὺς πέλεκυν μέγαν ἠὲ σκέπαρνον εἰν ὕδατι ψυχρῷ βάπτῃ μεγάλα ἰάχοντα φαρμάσσων· τὸ γὰρ αὖτε σιδήρου γε κράτος ἐστίν ὣς τοῦ σίζʼ ὀφθαλμὸς ἐλαϊνέῳ περὶ μοχλῷ. σμερδαλέον δὲ μέγʼ ᾤμωξεν, περὶ δʼ ἴαχε πέτρη, ἡμεῖς δὲ δείσαντες ἀπεσσύμεθʼ· αὐτὰρ ὁ μοχλὸν ἐξέρυσʼ ὀφθαλμοῖο πεφυρμένον αἵματι πολλῷ. τὸν μὲν ἔπειτʼ ἔρριψεν ἀπὸ ἕο χερσὶν ἀλύων, αὐτὰρ ὁ Κύκλωπας μεγάλʼ ἤπυεν, οἵ ῥά μιν ἀμφὶς ᾤκεον ἐν σπήεσσι διʼ ἄκριας ἠνεμοέσσας. οἱ δὲ βοῆς ἀίοντες ἐφοίτων ἄλλοθεν ἄλλος, ἱστάμενοι δʼ εἴροντο περὶ σπέος ὅττι ἑ κήδοι·
"""‘What ails you, Polyphemus,’ said they, ‘that you make such a noise, breaking the stillness of the night, and preventing us from being able to sleep? Surely no man is carrying off your sheep? Surely no man is trying to kill you either by fraud or by force  ?"	τίπτε τόσον, Πολύφημʼ, ἀρημένος ὧδʼ ἐβόησας νύκτα διʼ ἀμβροσίην καὶ ἀύπνους ἄμμε τίθησθα; ἦ μή τίς σευ μῆλα βροτῶν ἀέκοντος ἐλαύνει; ἦ μή τίς σʼ αὐτὸν κτείνει δόλῳ ἠὲ βίηφιν;

"""‘Then,’ said they, ‘if no man is attacking you, you must be ill; when Zeus makes people ill, there is no help for it, and you had better pray to your father Poseidon.’"	οἱ δʼ ἀπαμειβόμενοι ἔπεα πτερόεντʼ ἀγόρευον· εἰ μὲν δὴ μή τίς σε βιάζεται οἶον ἐόντα, νοῦσον γʼ οὔ πως ἔστι Διὸς μεγάλου ἀλέασθαι, ἀλλὰ σύ γʼ εὔχεο πατρὶ Ποσειδάωνι ἄνακτι.
"""Then they went away, and I laughed inwardly at the success of my clever stratagem, but the Cyclops , groaning and in an agony of pain, felt about with his hands till he found the stone and took it from the door; then he sat in the doorway and stretched his hands in front of it to catch anyone going out with the sheep, for he thought I might be foolish enough to attempt this."	ὣς ἄρʼ ἔφαν ἀπιόντες, ἐμὸν δʼ ἐγέλασσε φίλον κῆρ, ὡς ὄνομʼ ἐξαπάτησεν ἐμὸν καὶ μῆτις ἀμύμων.

"""As for myself I kept on puzzling to think how I could best save my own life   and those of my companions; I schemed and schemed, as one who knows that his life depends upon it, for the danger was very great. In the end I deemed that this plan would be the best. The male sheep were well grown, and carried a heavy black fleece, so I bound them noiselessly in threes together, with some of the withies on which the wicked monster used to sleep. There was to be a man under the middle sheep, and the two on either side were to cover him, so that there were three sheep to each man. As for myself there was a ram finer than any of the others, so I caught hold of him by the back, ensconced myself in the thick wool under his belly, and hung on patiently to his fleece, face upwards, keeping a firm hold on it all the time."	αὐτὰρ ἐγὼ βούλευον, ὅπως ὄχʼ ἄριστα γένοιτο, εἴ τινʼ ἑταίροισιν θανάτου λύσιν ἠδʼ ἐμοὶ αὐτῷ εὑροίμην· πάντας δὲ δόλους καὶ μῆτιν ὕφαινον ὥς τε περὶ ψυχῆς· μέγα γὰρ κακὸν ἐγγύθεν ἦεν. ἥδε δέ μοι κατὰ θυμὸν ἀρίστη φαίνετο βουλή. ἄρσενες ὄιες ἦσαν ἐυτρεφέες, δασύμαλλοι, καλοί τε μεγάλοι τε, ἰοδνεφὲς εἶρος ἔχοντες· τοὺς ἀκέων συνέεργον ἐυστρεφέεσσι λύγοισιν, τῇς ἔπι Κύκλωψ εὗδε πέλωρ, ἀθεμίστια εἰδώς, σύντρεις αἰνύμενος· ὁ μὲν ἐν μέσῳ ἄνδρα φέρεσκε, τὼ δʼ ἑτέρω ἑκάτερθεν ἴτην σώοντες ἑταίρους. τρεῖς δὲ ἕκαστον φῶτʼ ὄιες φέρον· αὐτὰρ ἐγώ γε— ἀρνειὸς γὰρ ἔην μήλων ὄχʼ ἄριστος ἁπάντων, τοῦ κατὰ νῶτα λαβών, λασίην ὑπὸ γαστέρʼ ἐλυσθεὶς κείμην· αὐτὰρ χερσὶν ἀώτου θεσπεσίοιο νωλεμέως στρεφθεὶς ἐχόμην τετληότι θυμῷ.
"""Thus, then, did we wait in great fear of mind till morning came, but when the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared, the male sheep hurried out to feed, while the ewes remained bleating about the pens waiting to be milked, for their udders were full to bursting; but their master in spite of all his pain felt the backs of all the sheep as they stood upright, without being sharp enough to find out that the men were underneath their bellies. As the ram was going out, last of all, heavy with its fleece and with the weight of my crafty self; Polyphemus laid hold of it and said:"	ὣς τότε μὲν στενάχοντες ἐμείναμεν Ἠῶ δῖαν. ἦμος δʼ ἠριγένεια φάνη ῥοδοδάκτυλος Ἠώς, καὶ τότʼ ἔπειτα νομόνδʼ ἐξέσσυτο ἄρσενα μῆλα, θήλειαι δὲ μέμηκον ἀνήμελκτοι περὶ σηκούς· οὔθατα γὰρ σφαραγεῦντο. ἄναξ δʼ ὀδύνῃσι κακῇσι τειρόμενος πάντων ὀίων ἐπεμαίετο νῶτα ὀρθῶν ἑσταότων· τὸ δὲ νήπιος οὐκ ἐνόησεν, ὥς οἱ ὑπʼ εἰροπόκων ὀίων στέρνοισι δέδεντο. ὕστατος ἀρνειὸς μήλων ἔστειχε θύραζε λάχνῳ στεινόμενος καὶ ἐμοὶ πυκινὰ φρονέοντι. τὸν δʼ ἐπιμασσάμενος προσέφη κρατερὸς Πολύφημος·
"""‘My good ram, what is it that makes you the last to leave my cave this morning? You are not wont to let the ewes go before you, but lead the mob with a run whether to flowery mead or bubbling fountain, and are the first to come home again at night; but now you lag last of all. Is it because you know your master has lost his eye, and are sorry because that wicked Noman and his horrid crew have got him down in his drink and blinded him? But I will have his life yet. If you could understand and talk, you would tell me where the wretch is hiding, and I would dash his brains upon the ground till they flew all over the cave. I should thus have some satisfaction for the harm this no-good Noman has done me.’"	κριὲ πέπον, τί μοι ὧδε διὰ σπέος ἔσσυο μήλων ὕστατος; οὔ τι πάρος γε λελειμμένος ἔρχεαι οἰῶν, ἀλλὰ πολὺ πρῶτος νέμεαι τέρενʼ ἄνθεα ποίης μακρὰ βιβάς, πρῶτος δὲ ῥοὰς ποταμῶν ἀφικάνεις, πρῶτος δὲ σταθμόνδε λιλαίεαι ἀπονέεσθαι ἑσπέριος· νῦν αὖτε πανύστατος. ἦ σύ γʼ ἄνακτος ὀφθαλμὸν ποθέεις, τὸν ἀνὴρ κακὸς ἐξαλάωσε σὺν λυγροῖς ἑτάροισι δαμασσάμενος φρένας οἴνῳ, Οὖτις, ὃν οὔ πώ φημι πεφυγμένον εἶναι ὄλεθρον. εἰ δὴ ὁμοφρονέοις ποτιφωνήεις τε γένοιο εἰπεῖν ὅππῃ κεῖνος ἐμὸν μένος ἠλασκάζει· τῷ κέ οἱ ἐγκέφαλός γε διὰ σπέος ἄλλυδις ἄλλῃ θεινομένου ῥαίοιτο πρὸς οὔδεϊ, κὰδ δέ κʼ ἐμὸν κῆρ λωφήσειε κακῶν, τά μοι οὐτιδανὸς πόρεν Οὖτις.
"""As spoke he drove the ram outside, but when we were a little way out from the cave and yards, I first got from under the ram's belly, and then freed my comrades; as for the sheep, which were very fat, by constantly heading them in the right direction we managed to drive them down to the ship. The crew rejoiced greatly at seeing those of us who had escaped death, but wept for the others whom the Cyclops had killed. However, I made signs to them by nodding and frowning that they were to hush their crying, and told them to get all the sheep on board at once and put out to sea; so they went aboard, took their places, and smote the gray sea with their oars. Then, when I had got as far out as my voice would reach, I began to jeer at the Cyclops ."	ὣς εἰπὼν τὸν κριὸν ἀπὸ ἕο πέμπε θύραζε. ἐλθόντες δʼ ἠβαιὸν ἀπὸ σπείους τε καὶ αὐλῆς πρῶτος ὑπʼ ἀρνειοῦ λυόμην, ὑπέλυσα δʼ ἑταίρους. καρπαλίμως δὲ τὰ μῆλα ταναύποδα, πίονα δημῷ, πολλὰ περιτροπέοντες ἐλαύνομεν, ὄφρʼ ἐπὶ νῆα ἱκόμεθʼ. ἀσπάσιοι δὲ φίλοις ἑτάροισι φάνημεν, οἳ φύγομεν θάνατον, τοὺς δὲ στενάχοντο γοῶντες. ἀλλʼ ἐγὼ οὐκ εἴων, ἀνὰ δʼ ὀφρύσι νεῦον ἑκάστῳ, κλαίειν, ἀλλʼ ἐκέλευσα θοῶς καλλίτριχα μῆλα πόλλʼ ἐν νηὶ βαλόντας ἐπιπλεῖν ἁλμυρὸν ὕδωρ. οἱ δʼ αἶψʼ εἴσβαινον καὶ ἐπὶ κληῖσι καθῖζον, ἑξῆς δʼ ἑζόμενοι πολιὴν ἅλα τύπτον ἐρετμοῖς. ἀλλʼ ὅτε τόσσον ἀπῆν, ὅσσον τε γέγωνε βοήσας, καὶ τότʼ ἐγὼ Κύκλωπα προσηύδων κερτομίοισι·

"""He got more and more furious as he heard me, so he tore the top from off a high mountain, and flung it just in front of my ship so that it was within a little of hitting the end of the rudder. The sea quaked as the rock fell into it, and the wash of the wave it raised carried us back towards the mainland, and forced us towards the shore. But I snatched up a long pole and kept the ship off, making signs to my men by nodding my head, that they must row for their lives, whereon they laid out with a will. When we had got twice as far as we were before, I was for jeering at the Cyclops again, but the men begged and prayed of me to hold my tongue."	ὣς ἐφάμην, ὁ δʼ ἔπειτα χολώσατο κηρόθι μᾶλλον, ἧκε δʼ ἀπορρήξας κορυφὴν ὄρεος μεγάλοιο, κὰδ δʼ ἔβαλε προπάροιθε νεὸς κυανοπρῴροιο τυτθόν, ἐδεύησεν δʼ οἰήιον ἄκρον ἱκέσθαι, ἐκλύσθη δὲ θάλασσα κατερχομένης ὑπὸ πέτρης· τὴν δʼ αἶψʼ ἤπειρόνδε παλιρρόθιον φέρε κῦμα, πλημυρὶς ἐκ πόντοιο, θέμωσε δὲ χέρσον ἱκέσθαι. αὐτὰρ ἐγὼ χείρεσσι λαβὼν περιμήκεα κοντὸν ὦσα παρέξ, ἑτάροισι δʼ ἐποτρύνας ἐκέλευσα ἐμβαλέειν κώπῃς, ἵνʼ ὑπὲκ κακότητα φύγοιμεν, κρατὶ κατανεύων· οἱ δὲ προπεσόντες ἔρεσσον. ἀλλʼ ὅτε δὴ δὶς τόσσον ἅλα πρήσσοντες ἀπῆμεν, καὶ τότε δὴ Κύκλωπα προσηύδων· ἀμφὶ δʼ ἑταῖροι μειλιχίοις ἐπέεσσιν ἐρήτυον ἄλλοθεν ἄλλος·

"""On this he lifted up his hands to the firmament of heaven and prayed, saying, ‘Hear me, great Poseidon; if I am indeed your own true-begotten son, grant that Odysseus may never reach his home alive; or if he must get back to his friends at last, let him do so late and in sore plight after losing all his men let him reach his home in another man's ship and find trouble in his house.’"	ὣς ἐφάμην, ὁ δʼ ἔπειτα Ποσειδάωνι ἄνακτι εὔχετο χεῖρʼ ὀρέγων εἰς οὐρανὸν ἀστερόεντα· κλῦθι, Ποσείδαον γαιήοχε κυανοχαῖτα, εἰ ἐτεόν γε σός εἰμι, πατὴρ δʼ ἐμὸς εὔχεαι εἶναι, δὸς μὴ Ὀδυσσῆα πτολιπόρθιον οἴκαδʼ ἱκέσθαι υἱὸν Λαέρτεω, Ἰθάκῃ ἔνι οἰκίʼ ἔχοντα. ἀλλʼ εἴ οἱ μοῖρʼ ἐστὶ φίλους τʼ ἰδέειν καὶ ἱκέσθαι οἶκον ἐυκτίμενον καὶ ἑὴν ἐς πατρίδα γαῖαν, ὀψὲ κακῶς ἔλθοι, ὀλέσας ἄπο πάντας ἑταίρους, νηὸς ἐπʼ ἀλλοτρίης, εὕροι δʼ ἐν πήματα οἴκῳ.
"""Thus did he pray, and Poseidon heard his prayer. Then he picked up a rock much larger than the first, swung it aloft and hurled it with prodigious force. It fell just short of the ship, but was within a little of hitting the end of the rudder. The sea quaked as the rock fell into it, and the wash of the wave it raised drove us onwards on our way towards the shore of the island."	ὣς ἔφατʼ εὐχόμενος, τοῦ δʼ ἔκλυε κυανοχαίτης. αὐτὰρ ὅ γʼ ἐξαῦτις πολὺ μείζονα λᾶαν ἀείρας ἧκʼ ἐπιδινήσας, ἐπέρεισε δὲ ἶνʼ ἀπέλεθρον, κὰδʼ δʼ ἔβαλεν μετόπισθε νεὸς κυανοπρῴροιο τυτθόν, ἐδεύησεν δʼ οἰήιον ἄκρον ἱκέσθαι. ἐκλύσθη δὲ θάλασσα κατερχομένης ὑπὸ πέτρης· τὴν δὲ πρόσω φέρε κῦμα, θέμωσε δὲ χέρσον ἱκέσθαι.
"""When at last we got to the island where we had left the rest of our ships, we found our comrades lamenting us, and anxiously awaiting our return. We ran our vessel upon the sands and got out of her on to the sea shore; we also landed the Cyclops ’ sheep, and divided them equitably amongst us so that none might have reason to complain. As for the ram, my companions agreed that I should have it as an extra share; so I sacrificed it on the sea shore, and burned its thigh bones to Zeus, who is the lord of all. But he heeded not my sacrifice, and only thought how he might destroy my ships and my comrades."	ἀλλʼ ὅτε δὴ τὴν νῆσον ἀφικόμεθʼ, ἔνθα περ ἄλλαι νῆες ἐύσσελμοι μένον ἁθρόαι, ἀμφὶ δʼ ἑταῖροι ἥατʼ ὀδυρόμενοι, ἡμέας ποτιδέγμενοι αἰεί, νῆα μὲν ἔνθʼ ἐλθόντες ἐκέλσαμεν ἐν ψαμάθοισιν, ἐκ δὲ καὶ αὐτοὶ βῆμεν ἐπὶ ῥηγμῖνι θαλάσσης. μῆλα δὲ Κύκλωπος γλαφυρῆς ἐκ νηὸς ἑλόντες δασσάμεθʼ, ὡς μή τίς μοι ἀτεμβόμενος κίοι ἴσης. ἀρνειὸν δʼ ἐμοὶ οἴῳ ἐυκνήμιδες ἑταῖροι μήλων δαιομένων δόσαν ἔξοχα· τὸν δʼ ἐπὶ θινὶ Ζηνὶ κελαινεφέι Κρονίδῃ, ὃς πᾶσιν ἀνάσσει, ῥέξας μηρίʼ ἔκαιον· ὁ δʼ οὐκ ἐμπάζετο ἱρῶν, ἀλλʼ ὅ γε μερμήριξεν ὅπως ἀπολοίατο πᾶσαι νῆες ἐύσσελμοι καὶ ἐμοὶ ἐρίηρες ἑταῖροι.
"""Thus through the livelong day to the going down of the sun we feasted our fill on meat and drink, but when the sun went down and it came on dark, we camped upon the beach. When the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared, I bade my men on board and loose the hawsers. Then they took their places and smote the gray sea with their oars; so we sailed on with sorrow in our hearts, but glad to have escaped death though we had lost our comrades."	ὣς τότε μὲν πρόπαν ἦμαρ ἐς ἠέλιον καταδύντα ἥμεθα δαινύμενοι κρέα τʼ ἄσπετα καὶ μέθυ ἡδύ· ἦμος δʼ ἠέλιος κατέδυ καὶ ἐπὶ κνέφας ἦλθε, δὴ τότε κοιμήθημεν ἐπὶ ῥηγμῖνι θαλάσσης. ἦμος δʼ ἠριγένεια φάνη ῥοδοδάκτυλος Ἠώς, δὴ τότʼ ἐγὼν ἑτάροισιν ἐποτρύνας ἐκέλευσα αὐτούς τʼ ἀμβαίνειν ἀνά τε πρυμνήσια λῦσαι· οἱ δʼ αἶψʼ εἴσβαινον καὶ ἐπὶ κληῖσι καθῖζον, ἑξῆς δʼ ἑζόμενοι πολιὴν ἅλα τύπτον ἐρετμοῖς. ἔνθεν δὲ προτέρω πλέομεν ἀκαχήμενοι ἦτορ,
Thence we went on to the Aeolian island where lives Aeolus son of Hippotas, dear to the immortal gods. It is an island that floats (as it were) upon the sea, iron bound with a wall that girds it. Now, Aeolus has six daughters and six sons in the bloom of youth, so he made the sons marry the daughters, and they all live with their dear father and mother, feasting and enjoying every conceivable kind of luxury. All day long the atmosphere of the house is loaded with the savor of roasting meats till it groans again, yard and all; but by night they sleep on their well-made bedsteads, each with his own wife between the blankets. These were the people among whom we had now come.	Αἰολίην δʼ ἐς νῆσον ἀφικόμεθʼ· ἔνθα δʼ ἔναιεν Αἴολος Ἱπποτάδης, φίλος ἀθανάτοισι θεοῖσιν, πλωτῇ ἐνὶ νήσῳ· πᾶσαν δέ τέ μιν πέρι τεῖχος χάλκεον ἄρρηκτον, λισσὴ δʼ ἀναδέδρομε πέτρη. τοῦ καὶ δώδεκα παῖδες ἐνὶ μεγάροις γεγάασιν, ἓξ μὲν θυγατέρες, ἓξ δʼ υἱέες ἡβώοντες· ἔνθʼ ὅ γε θυγατέρας πόρεν υἱάσιν εἶναι ἀκοίτις. οἱ δʼ αἰεὶ παρὰ πατρὶ φίλῳ καὶ μητέρι κεδνῇ δαίνυνται, παρὰ δέ σφιν ὀνείατα μυρία κεῖται, κνισῆεν δέ τε δῶμα περιστεναχίζεται αὐλῇ ἤματα· νύκτας δʼ αὖτε παρʼ αἰδοίῃς ἀλόχοισιν εὕδουσʼ ἔν τε τάπησι καὶ ἐν τρητοῖσι λέχεσσι. καὶ μὲν τῶν ἱκόμεσθα πόλιν καὶ δώματα καλά.
"""Aeolus entertained me for a whole month asking me questions all the time about Troy , the Argive fleet, and the return   of the Achaeans. I told him exactly how everything had happened, and when I said I must go, and asked him to further me on my way, he made no sort of difficulty, but set about doing so at once. Moreover, he flayed me a prime ox-hide to hold the ways of the roaring winds, which he shut up in the hide as in a sack - for Zeus had made him captain over the winds, and he could stir or still each one of them according to his own pleasure. He put the sack in the ship and bound the mouth so tightly with a silver thread that not even a breath of a side-wind could blow from any quarter. The West wind which was fair for us did he alone let blow as it chose; but it all came to nothing, for we were lost through our own folly."	μῆνα δὲ πάντα φίλει με καὶ ἐξερέεινεν ἕκαστα, Ἴλιον Ἀργείων τε νέας καὶ νόστον Ἀχαιῶν· καὶ μὲν ἐγὼ τῷ πάντα κατὰ μοῖραν κατέλεξα. ἀλλʼ ὅτε δὴ καὶ ἐγὼν ὁδὸν ᾔτεον ἠδʼ ἐκέλευον πεμπέμεν, οὐδέ τι κεῖνος ἀνήνατο, τεῦχε δὲ πομπήν. δῶκε δέ μʼ ἐκδείρας ἀσκὸν βοὸς ἐννεώροιο, ἔνθα δὲ βυκτάων ἀνέμων κατέδησε κέλευθα· κεῖνον γὰρ ταμίην ἀνέμων ποίησε Κρονίων, ἠμὲν παυέμεναι ἠδʼ ὀρνύμεν, ὅν κʼ ἐθέλῃσι. νηὶ δʼ ἐνὶ γλαφυρῇ κατέδει μέρμιθι φαεινῇ ἀργυρέῃ, ἵνα μή τι παραπνεύσῃ ὀλίγον περ· αὐτὰρ ἐμοὶ πνοιὴν Ζεφύρου προέηκεν ἀῆναι, ὄφρα φέροι νῆάς τε καὶ αὐτούς· οὐδʼ ἄρʼ ἔμελλεν ἐκτελέειν· αὐτῶν γὰρ ἀπωλόμεθʼ ἀφραδίῃσιν.
"""Nine days and nine nights did we sail, and on the tenth day our native land showed on the horizon. We got so close in that we could see the stubble fires burning, and I, being then dead tired, fell into a light sleep, for I had never let the rudder out of my own hands, that we might get home the faster. On this the men fell to talking among themselves, and said I was bringing back gold and silver in the sack that Aeolus had given me. ‘Bless my heart,’ would one turn to his neighbor, saying, ‘how this man gets honored and makes friends in whatever city or country he may go. See what fine prizes he is taking home from Troy , while we, who have traveled just as far as he has, come back with hands as empty as we set out with - and now Aeolus has given him ever so much more. Quick - let us see what it all is, and how much gold and silver there is in the sack he gave him.’"	ἐννῆμαρ μὲν ὁμῶς πλέομεν νύκτας τε καὶ ἦμαρ, τῇ δεκάτῃ δʼ ἤδη ἀνεφαίνετο πατρὶς ἄρουρα, καὶ δὴ πυρπολέοντας ἐλεύσσομεν ἐγγὺς ἐόντες· ἔνθʼ ἐμὲ μὲν γλυκὺς ὕπνος ἐπήλυθε κεκμηῶτα, αἰεὶ γὰρ πόδα νηὸς ἐνώμων, οὐδέ τῳ ἄλλῳ δῶχʼ ἑτάρων, ἵνα θᾶσσον ἱκοίμεθα πατρίδα γαῖαν· οἱ δʼ ἕταροι ἐπέεσσι πρὸς ἀλλήλους ἀγόρευον, καί μʼ ἔφασαν χρυσόν τε καὶ ἄργυρον οἴκαδʼ ἄγεσθαι δῶρα παρʼ Αἰόλου μεγαλήτορος Ἱπποτάδαο. ὧδε δέ τις εἴπεσκεν ἰδὼν ἐς πλησίον ἄλλον· ὦ πόποι, ὡς ὅδε πᾶσι φίλος καὶ τίμιός ἐστιν ἀνθρώποις, ὅτεών τε πόλιν καὶ γαῖαν ἵκηται. πολλὰ μὲν ἐκ Τροίης ἄγεται κειμήλια καλὰ ληίδος, ἡμεῖς δʼ αὖτε ὁμὴν ὁδὸν ἐκτελέσαντες οἴκαδε νισσόμεθα κενεὰς σὺν χεῖρας ἔχοντες· καὶ νῦν οἱ τάδʼ ἔδωκε χαριζόμενος φιλότητι Αἴολος. ἀλλʼ ἄγε θᾶσσον ἰδώμεθα ὅττι τάδʼ ἐστίν, ὅσσος τις χρυσός τε καὶ ἄργυρος ἀσκῷ ἔνεστιν.
"""Thus they talked and evil counsels prevailed. They loosed the sack, whereupon the wind flew howling forth and raised a storm that carried us weeping out to sea and away from our own country. Then I awoke, and knew not whether to throw myself into the sea or to live on and make the best of it; but I bore it, covered myself up, and lay down in the ship, while the men lamented bitterly as the fierce winds bore our fleet back to the Aeolian island."	ὣς ἔφασαν, βουλὴ δὲ κακὴ νίκησεν ἑταίρων· ἀσκὸν μὲν λῦσαν, ἄνεμοι δʼ ἐκ πάντες ὄρουσαν. τοὺς δʼ αἶψʼ ἁρπάξασα φέρεν πόντονδε θύελλα κλαίοντας, γαίης ἄπο πατρίδος. αὐτὰρ ἐγώ γε ἐγρόμενος κατὰ θυμὸν ἀμύμονα μερμήριξα, ἠὲ πεσὼν ἐκ νηὸς ἀποφθίμην ἐνὶ πόντῳ, ἦ ἀκέων τλαίην καὶ ἔτι ζωοῖσι μετείην. ἀλλʼ ἔτλην καὶ ἔμεινα, καλυψάμενος δʼ ἐνὶ νηὶ κείμην. αἱ δʼ ἐφέροντο κακῇ ἀνέμοιο θυέλλῃ αὖτις ἐπʼ Αἰολίην νῆσον, στενάχοντο δʼ ἑταῖροι.
"""When we reached it we went ashore to take in water, and dined hard by the ships. Immediately after dinner I took a herald and one of my men and went straight to the house of Aeolus, where I found him feasting with his wife and family; so we sat down as suppliants on the threshold. They were astounded when they saw us and said, ‘Odysseus, what brings you here? What has been ill-treating you? We took great pains to further you on your way home to Ithaca , or wherever it was that you wanted to go to.’"	ἔνθα δʼ ἐπʼ ἠπείρου βῆμεν καὶ ἀφυσσάμεθʼ ὕδωρ, αἶψα δὲ δεῖπνον ἕλοντο θοῇς παρὰ νηυσὶν ἑταῖροι. αὐτὰρ ἐπεὶ σίτοιό τʼ ἐπασσάμεθʼ ἠδὲ ποτῆτος, δὴ τότʼ ἐγὼ κήρυκά τʼ ὀπασσάμενος καὶ ἑταῖρον βῆν εἰς Αἰόλου κλυτὰ δώματα· τὸν δʼ ἐκίχανον δαινύμενον παρὰ ᾗ τʼ ἀλόχῳ καὶ οἷσι τέκεσσιν. ἐλθόντες δʼ ἐς δῶμα παρὰ σταθμοῖσιν ἐπʼ οὐδοῦ ἑζόμεθʼ· οἱ δʼ ἀνὰ θυμὸν ἐθάμβεον ἔκ τʼ ἐρέοντο· πῶς ἦλθες, Ὀδυσεῦ; τίς τοι κακὸς ἔχραε δαίμων; ἦ μέν σʼ ἐνδυκέως ἀπεπέμπομεν, ὄφρʼ ἀφίκοιο πατρίδα σὴν καὶ δῶμα καὶ εἴ πού τοι φίλον ἐστίν.
"""Thus did they speak, but I answered sorrowfully, ‘My men have undone me; they, and cruel sleep, have ruined me. My friends, mend me this mischief, for you can if you will.’"	ὣς φάσαν, αὐτὰρ ἐγὼ μετεφώνεον ἀχνύμενος κῆρ· ἄασάν μʼ ἕταροί τε κακοὶ πρὸς τοῖσί τε ὕπνος σχέτλιος. ἀλλʼ ἀκέσασθε, φίλοι· δύναμις γὰρ ἐν ὑμῖν.
"""I spoke as movingly as I could, but they said nothing, till their father answered, ‘Vilest of humankind, get you gone at once out of the island; him whom heaven hates will I in no wise help. Be off, for you come here as one abhorred of heaven.' And with these words he sent me sorrowing from his door."	ὣς ἐφάμην μαλακοῖσι καθαπτόμενος ἐπέεσσιν, οἱ δʼ ἄνεῳ ἐγένοντο· πατὴρ δʼ ἠμείβετο μύθῳ· ἔρρʼ ἐκ νήσου θᾶσσον, ἐλέγχιστε ζωόντων· οὐ γάρ μοι θέμις ἐστὶ κομιζέμεν οὐδʼ ἀποπέμπειν ἄνδρα τόν, ὅς κε θεοῖσιν ἀπέχθηται μακάρεσσιν· ἔρρε, ἐπεὶ ἄρα θεοῖσιν ἀπεχθόμενος τόδʼ ἱκάνεις. ὣς εἰπὼν ἀπέπεμπε δόμων βαρέα στενάχοντα.
"""Thence we sailed sadly on till the men were worn out with long and fruitless rowing, for there was no longer any wind to help them. Six days, night and day did we toil, and on the seventh day we reached the rocky stronghold of Lamos - Telepylos, the city of the Laestrygonians, where the shepherd who is driving in his sheep and goats to be milked salutes him who is driving out his flock to feed and this last answers the salute. In that country a man who could do without sleep might earn double wages, one as a herdsman of cattle, and another as a shepherd, for they work much the same by night as they do by day."	ἔνθεν δὲ προτέρω πλέομεν ἀκαχήμενοι ἦτορ. τείρετο δʼ ἀνδρῶν θυμὸς ὑπʼ εἰρεσίης ἀλεγεινῆς ἡμετέρῃ ματίῃ, ἐπεὶ οὐκέτι φαίνετο πομπή. ἑξῆμαρ μὲν ὁμῶς πλέομεν νύκτας τε καὶ ἦμαρ, ἑβδομάτῃ δʼ ἱκόμεσθα Λάμου αἰπὺ πτολίεθρον, Τηλέπυλον Λαιστρυγονίην, ὅθι ποιμένα ποιμὴν ἠπύει εἰσελάων, ὁ δέ τʼ ἐξελάων ὑπακούει. ἔνθα κʼ ἄυπνος ἀνὴρ δοιοὺς ἐξήρατο μισθούς, τὸν μὲν βουκολέων, τὸν δʼ ἄργυφα μῆλα νομεύων· ἐγγὺς γὰρ νυκτός τε καὶ ἤματός εἰσι κέλευθοι.
"""When we reached the harbor we found it land-locked under steep cliffs, with a narrow entrance between two headlands. My captains took all their ships inside, and made them fast close to one another, for there was never so much as a breath of wind inside, but it was always dead calm. I kept my own ship outside, and moored it to a rock at the very end of the point; then I climbed a high rock to reconnoiter, but could see no sign neither of man nor cattle, only some smoke rising from the ground. So I sent two of my company with an attendant to find out what sort of people the inhabitants were."	ἔνθʼ ἐπεὶ ἐς λιμένα κλυτὸν ἤλθομεν, ὃν πέρι πέτρη ἠλίβατος τετύχηκε διαμπερὲς ἀμφοτέρωθεν, ἀκταὶ δὲ προβλῆτες ἐναντίαι ἀλλήλῃσιν ἐν στόματι προύχουσιν, ἀραιὴ δʼ εἴσοδός ἐστιν, ἔνθʼ οἵ γʼ εἴσω πάντες ἔχον νέας ἀμφιελίσσας. αἱ μὲν ἄρʼ ἔντοσθεν λιμένος κοίλοιο δέδεντο πλησίαι· οὐ μὲν γάρ ποτʼ ἀέξετο κῦμά γʼ ἐν αὐτῷ, οὔτε μέγʼ οὔτʼ ὀλίγον, λευκὴ δʼ ἦν ἀμφὶ γαλήνη· αὐτὰρ ἐγὼν οἶος σχέθον ἔξω νῆα μέλαιναν, αὐτοῦ ἐπʼ ἐσχατιῇ, πέτρης ἐκ πείσματα δήσας· ἔστην δὲ σκοπιὴν ἐς παιπαλόεσσαν ἀνελθών. ἔνθα μὲν οὔτε βοῶν οὔτʼ ἀνδρῶν φαίνετο ἔργα, καπνὸν δʼ οἶον ὁρῶμεν ἀπὸ χθονὸς ἀίσσοντα. δὴ τότʼ ἐγὼν ἑτάρους προΐειν πεύθεσθαι ἰόντας, οἵ τινες ἀνέρες εἶεν ἐπὶ χθονὶ σῖτον ἔδοντες, ἄνδρε δύω κρίνας, τρίτατον κήρυχʼ ἅμʼ ὀπάσσας.
"""The men when they got on shore followed a level road by which the people draw their firewood from the mountains into the town, till presently they met a young woman who had come outside to fetch water, and who was daughter to a Laestrygonian named Antiphates. She was going to the fountain Artacia from which the people bring in their water, and when my men had come close up to her, they asked her who the king of that country might be, and over what kind of people he ruled; so she directed them to her father's house, but when they got there they found his wife to be a giantess as huge as a mountain, and they were horrified at the sight of her."	οἱ δʼ ἴσαν ἐκβάντες λείην ὁδόν, ᾗ περ ἄμαξαι ἄστυδʼ ἀφʼ ὑψηλῶν ὀρέων καταγίνεον ὕλην, κούρῃ δὲ ξύμβληντο πρὸ ἄστεος ὑδρευούσῃ, θυγατέρʼ ἰφθίμῃ Λαιστρυγόνος Ἀντιφάταο. ἡ μὲν ἄρʼ ἐς κρήνην κατεβήσετο καλλιρέεθρον Ἀρτακίην· ἔνθεν γὰρ ὕδωρ προτὶ ἄστυ φέρεσκον· οἱ δὲ παριστάμενοι προσεφώνεον ἔκ τʼ ἐρέοντο ὅς τις τῶνδʼ εἴη βασιλεὺς καὶ οἷσιν ἀνάσσοι· ἡ δὲ μάλʼ αὐτίκα πατρὸς ἐπέφραδεν ὑψερεφὲς δῶ. οἱ δʼ ἐπεὶ εἰσῆλθον κλυτὰ δώματα, τὴν δὲ γυναῖκα εὗρον, ὅσην τʼ ὄρεος κορυφήν, κατὰ δʼ ἔστυγον αὐτήν.
"""She at once called her husband Antiphates from the place of assembly, and forthwith he set about killing my men. He snatched up one of them, and began to make his dinner of him then and there, whereon the other two ran back to the ships as fast as ever they could. But Antiphates raised a hue and cry after them, and thousands of sturdy Laestrygonians sprang up from every quarter - ogres, not men. They threw vast rocks at us from the cliffs as though they had been mere stones, and I heard the horrid sound of the ships crunching up against one another, and the death cries of my men, as the Laestrygonians speared them like fishes and took them home to eat them. While they were thus killing my men within the harbor I drew my sword, cut the cable of my own ship, and told my men to row with all their might if they too would not fare like the rest; so they laid out for their lives, and we were thankful enough when we got into open water out of reach of the rocks they hurled at us. As for the others there was not one of them left."	ἡ δʼ αἶψʼ ἐξ ἀγορῆς ἐκάλει κλυτὸν Ἀντιφατῆα, ὃν πόσιν, ὃς δὴ τοῖσιν ἐμήσατο λυγρὸν ὄλεθρον. αὐτίχʼ ἕνα μάρψας ἑτάρων ὡπλίσσατο δεῖπνον· τὼ δὲ δύʼ ἀίξαντε φυγῇ ἐπὶ νῆας ἱκέσθην. αὐτὰρ ὁ τεῦχε βοὴν διὰ ἄστεος· οἱ δʼ ἀίοντες φοίτων ἴφθιμοι Λαιστρυγόνες ἄλλοθεν ἄλλος, μυρίοι, οὐκ ἄνδρεσσιν ἐοικότες, ἀλλὰ Γίγασιν. οἵ ῥʼ ἀπὸ πετράων ἀνδραχθέσι χερμαδίοισιν βάλλον· ἄφαρ δὲ κακὸς κόναβος κατὰ νῆας ὀρώρει ἀνδρῶν τʼ ὀλλυμένων νηῶν θʼ ἅμα ἀγνυμενάων· ἰχθῦς δʼ ὣς πείροντες ἀτερπέα δαῖτα φέροντο. ὄφρʼ οἱ τοὺς ὄλεκον λιμένος πολυβενθέος ἐντός, τόφρα δʼ ἐγὼ ξίφος ὀξὺ ἐρυσσάμενος παρὰ μηροῦ τῷ ἀπὸ πείσματʼ ἔκοψα νεὸς κυανοπρῴροιο. αἶψα δʼ ἐμοῖς ἑτάροισιν ἐποτρύνας ἐκέλευσα ἐμβαλέειν κώπῃς, ἵνʼ ὑπὲκ κακότητα φύγοιμεν· οἱ δʼ ἅλα πάντες ἀνέρριψαν, δείσαντες ὄλεθρον. ἀσπασίως δʼ ἐς πόντον ἐπηρεφέας φύγε πέτρας νηῦς ἐμή· αὐτὰρ αἱ ἄλλαι ἀολλέες αὐτόθʼ ὄλοντο.
"""Thence we sailed sadly on, glad to have escaped death, though we had lost our comrades, and came to the Aeaean island, where Circe lives, a great and cunning goddess who is own sister to the magician Aietes - for they are both children of the sun by Perse, who is daughter to Okeanos. We brought our ship into a safe harbor without a word, for some god guided us there, and having landed we stayed there for two days and two nights, worn out in body and mind. When the morning of the third day came I took my spear and my sword, and went away from the ship to reconnoiter, and see if I could discover signs of human handiwork, or hear the sound of voices. Climbing to the top of a high look-out I espied the smoke of Circe's house rising upwards amid a dense forest of trees, and when I saw this I doubted whether, having seen the smoke, I would not go on at once and find out more, but in the end I deemed it best to go back to the ship, give the men their dinners, and send some of them instead of going myself."	ἔνθεν δὲ προτέρω πλέομεν ἀκαχήμενοι ἦτορ, ἄσμενοι ἐκ θανάτοιο, φίλους ὀλέσαντες ἑταίρους.

"""When I had nearly got back to the ship some god took pity upon my solitude, and sent a fine antlered stag right into the middle of my path. He was coming down his pasture in the forest to drink of the river, for the heat of the sun drove him, and as he passed I struck him in the middle of the back; the bronze point of the spear went clean through him, and he lay groaning in the dust until the life went out of him. Then I set my foot upon him, drew my spear from the wound, and laid it down; I also gathered rough grass and rushes and twisted them into a fathom or so of good stout rope, with which I bound the four feet of the noble creature together; having so done I hung him round my neck and walked back to the ship leaning upon my spear, for the stag was much too big for me to be able to carry him on my shoulder, steadying him with one hand. As I threw him down in front of the ship, I called the men and spoke cheeringly man by man to each of them. ‘Look here my friends,’ said I, ‘we are not going to die so much before our time after all, and at any rate we will not starve so long as we have got something to eat and drink on board.’ On this they uncovered their heads upon the sea shore and admired the stag, for he was indeed a splendid man. Then, when they had feasted their eyes upon him sufficiently, they washed their hands and began to cook him for dinner."	ἀλλʼ ὅτε δὴ σχεδὸν ἦα κιὼν νεὸς ἀμφιελίσσης, καὶ τότε τίς με θεῶν ὀλοφύρατο μοῦνον ἐόντα, ὅς ῥά μοι ὑψίκερων ἔλαφον μέγαν εἰς ὁδὸν αὐτὴν ἧκεν. ὁ μὲν ποταμόνδε κατήιεν ἐκ νομοῦ ὕλης πιόμενος· δὴ γάρ μιν ἔχεν μένος ἠελίοιο. τὸν δʼ ἐγὼ ἐκβαίνοντα κατʼ ἄκνηστιν μέσα νῶτα πλῆξα· τὸ δʼ ἀντικρὺ δόρυ χάλκεον ἐξεπέρησε, κὰδ δʼ ἔπεσʼ ἐν κονίῃσι μακών, ἀπὸ δʼ ἔπτατο θυμός. τῷ δʼ ἐγὼ ἐμβαίνων δόρυ χάλκεον ἐξ ὠτειλῆς εἰρυσάμην· τὸ μὲν αὖθι κατακλίνας ἐπὶ γαίῃ εἴασʼ· αὐτὰρ ἐγὼ σπασάμην ῥῶπάς τε λύγους τε, πεῖσμα δʼ, ὅσον τʼ ὄργυιαν, ἐυστρεφὲς ἀμφοτέρωθεν πλεξάμενος συνέδησα πόδας δεινοῖο πελώρου, βῆν δὲ καταλοφάδεια φέρων ἐπὶ νῆα μέλαιναν ἔγχει ἐρειδόμενος, ἐπεὶ οὔ πως ἦεν ἐπʼ ὤμου χειρὶ φέρειν ἑτέρῃ· μάλα γὰρ μέγα θηρίον ἦεν. κὰδʼ δʼ ἔβαλον προπάροιθε νεός, ἀνέγειρα δʼ ἑταίρους μειλιχίοις ἐπέεσσι παρασταδὸν ἄνδρα ἕκαστον· ὦ φίλοι, οὐ γάρ πω καταδυσόμεθʼ ἀχνύμενοί περ εἰς Ἀίδαο δόμους, πρὶν μόρσιμον ἦμαρ ἐπέλθῃ· ἀλλʼ ἄγετʼ, ὄφρʼ ἐν νηὶ θοῇ βρῶσίς τε πόσις τε, μνησόμεθα βρώμης, μηδὲ τρυχώμεθα λιμῷ. ὣς ἐφάμην, οἱ δʼ ὦκα ἐμοῖς ἐπέεσσι πίθοντο, ἐκ δὲ καλυψάμενοι παρὰ θῖνʼ ἁλὸς ἀτρυγέτοιο θηήσαντʼ ἔλαφον· μάλα γὰρ μέγα θηρίον ἦεν. αὐτὰρ ἐπεὶ τάρπησαν ὁρώμενοι ὀφθαλμοῖσιν, χεῖρας νιψάμενοι τεύχοντʼ ἐρικυδέα δαῖτα.
"""Thus through the livelong day to the going down of the sun we stayed there eating and drinking our fill, but when the sun went down and it came on dark, we camped upon the sea shore. When the child of morning, fingered Dawn, appeared, I called a council and said, ‘My friends, we are in very great difficulties; listen therefore to me. We have no idea where the sun either sets or rises, so that we do not even know East from West. I see no way out of it; nevertheless, we must try and find one. We are certainly on an island, for I went as high as I could this morning, and saw the sea reaching all round it to the horizon; it lies low, but towards the middle I saw smoke rising from out of a thick forest of trees.’"	ὣς τότε μὲν πρόπαν ἦμαρ ἐς ἠέλιον καταδύντα ἥμεθα δαινύμενοι κρέα τʼ ἄσπετα καὶ μέθυ ἡδύ· ἦμος δʼ ἠέλιος κατέδυ καὶ ἐπὶ κνέφας ἦλθε, δὴ τότε κοιμήθημεν ἐπὶ ῥηγμῖνι θαλάσσης. ἦμος δʼ ἠριγένεια φάνη ῥοδοδάκτυλος Ἠώς, καὶ τότʼ ἐγὼν ἀγορὴν θέμενος μετὰ πᾶσιν ἔειπον· κέκλυτέ μευ μύθων, κακά περ πάσχοντες ἑταῖροι· ὦ φίλοι, οὐ γάρ τʼ ἴδμεν, ὅπῃ ζόφος οὐδʼ ὅπῃ ἠώς, οὐδʼ ὅπῃ ἠέλιος φαεσίμβροτος εἶσʼ ὑπὸ γαῖαν, οὐδʼ ὅπῃ ἀννεῖται· ἀλλὰ φραζώμεθα θᾶσσον εἴ τις ἔτʼ ἔσται μῆτις. ἐγὼ δʼ οὔκ οἴομαι εἶναι. εἶδον γὰρ σκοπιὴν ἐς παιπαλόεσσαν ἀνελθὼν νῆσον, τὴν πέρι πόντος ἀπείριτος ἐστεφάνωται· αὐτὴ δὲ χθαμαλὴ κεῖται· καπνὸν δʼ ἐνὶ μέσσῃ ἔδρακον ὀφθαλμοῖσι διὰ δρυμὰ πυκνὰ καὶ ὕλην.
"""Their hearts sank as they heard me, for they remembered how they had been treated by the Laestrygonian Antiphates, and by the savage ogre Polyphemus. They wept bitterly in their dismay, but there was nothing to be got by crying, so I divided them into two companies and set a leader over each; I gave one company to Eurylokhos, while I took command of the other myself. Then we cast lots in a helmet, and the lot fell upon Eurylokhos; so he set out with his twenty-two men, and they wept, as also did we who were left behind."	ὣς ἐφάμην, τοῖσιν δὲ κατεκλάσθη φίλον ἦτορ μνησαμένοις ἔργων Λαιστρυγόνος Ἀντιφάταο Κύκλωπός τε βίης μεγαλήτορος, ἀνδροφάγοιο. κλαῖον δὲ λιγέως θαλερὸν κατὰ δάκρυ χέοντες· ἀλλʼ οὐ γάρ τις πρῆξις ἐγίγνετο μυρομένοισιν. αὐτὰρ ἐγὼ δίχα πάντας ἐυκνήμιδας ἑταίρους ἠρίθμεον, ἀρχὸν δὲ μετʼ ἀμφοτέροισιν ὄπασσα· τῶν μὲν ἐγὼν ἦρχον, τῶν δʼ Εὐρύλοχος θεοειδής. κλήρους δʼ ἐν κυνέῃ χαλκήρεϊ πάλλομεν ὦκα· ἐκ δʼ ἔθορε κλῆρος μεγαλήτορος Εὐρυλόχοιο. βῆ δʼ ἰέναι, ἅμα τῷ γε δύω καὶ εἴκοσʼ ἑταῖροι κλαίοντες· κατὰ δʼ ἄμμε λίπον γοόωντας ὄπισθεν.
"""When they reached Circe's house they found it built of cut stones, on a site that could be seen from far, in the middle of the forest. There were wild mountain wolves and lions prowling all round it - poor bewitched creatures whom she had tamed by her enchantments and drugged into subjection. They did not attack my men, but wagged their great tails, fawned upon them, and rubbed their noses lovingly against them. As hounds crowd round their master when they see him coming from dinner - for they know he will bring them something - even so did these wolves and lions with their great claws fawn upon my men, but the men were terribly frightened at seeing such strange creatures. Presently they reached the gates of the goddess’ house, and as they stood there they could hear Circe within, singing most beautifully as she worked at her loom, making a web so fine, so soft, and of such dazzling colors as no one but a goddess could weave. On this Polites, whom I valued and trusted more than any other of my men, said, ‘There is some one inside working at a loom and singing most beautifully; the whole place resounds with it, let us call her and see whether she is woman or goddess.’"	εὗρον δʼ ἐν βήσσῃσι τετυγμένα δώματα Κίρκης ξεστοῖσιν λάεσσι, περισκέπτῳ ἐνὶ χώρῳ· ἀμφὶ δέ μιν λύκοι ἦσαν ὀρέστεροι ἠδὲ λέοντες, τοὺς αὐτὴ κατέθελξεν, ἐπεὶ κακὰ φάρμακʼ ἔδωκεν. οὐδʼ οἵ γʼ ὡρμήθησαν ἐπʼ ἀνδράσιν, ἀλλʼ ἄρα τοί γε οὐρῇσιν μακρῇσι περισσαίνοντες ἀνέσταν. ὡς δʼ ὅτʼ ἂν ἀμφὶ ἄνακτα κύνες δαίτηθεν ἰόντα σαίνωσʼ, αἰεὶ γάρ τε φέρει μειλίγματα θυμοῦ, ὣς τοὺς ἀμφὶ λύκοι κρατερώνυχες ἠδὲ λέοντες σαῖνον· τοὶ δʼ ἔδεισαν, ἐπεὶ ἴδον αἰνὰ πέλωρα. ἔσταν δʼ ἐν προθύροισι θεᾶς καλλιπλοκάμοιο, Κίρκης δʼ ἔνδον ἄκουον ἀειδούσης ὀπὶ καλῇ, ἱστὸν ἐποιχομένης μέγαν ἄμβροτον, οἷα θεάων λεπτά τε καὶ χαρίεντα καὶ ἀγλαὰ ἔργα πέλονται. τοῖσι δὲ μύθων ἦρχε Πολίτης ὄρχαμος ἀνδρῶν, ὅς μοι κήδιστος ἑτάρων ἦν κεδνότατός τε· ὦ φίλοι, ἔνδον γάρ τις ἐποιχομένη μέγαν ἱστὸν καλὸν ἀοιδιάει, δάπεδον δʼ ἅπαν ἀμφιμέμυκεν, ἢ θεὸς ἠὲ γυνή· ἀλλὰ φθεγγώμεθα θᾶσσον.
"""They called her and she came down, unfastened the door, and bade them enter. They, thinking no evil, followed her, all except Eurylokhos, who suspected mischief and stayed outside. When she had got them into her house, she set them upon benches and seats and mixed them a drink with cheese, honey, meal, and Pramnian wine but she drugged it with wicked poisons to make them forget their homes, and when they had drunk she turned them into pigs by a stroke of her wand, and shut them up in her pigsties. They were like pigs- head, hair, and all, and they grunted just as pigs do; but their senses   were the same as before, and they remembered everything."	ὣς ἄρʼ ἐφώνησεν, τοὶ δὲ φθέγγοντο καλεῦντες. ἡ δʼ αἶψʼ ἐξελθοῦσα θύρας ὤιξε φαεινὰς καὶ κάλει· οἱ δʼ ἅμα πάντες ἀιδρείῃσιν ἕποντο· Εὐρύλοχος δʼ ὑπέμεινεν, ὀισάμενος δόλον εἶναι. εἷσεν δʼ εἰσαγαγοῦσα κατὰ κλισμούς τε θρόνους τε, ἐν δέ σφιν τυρόν τε καὶ ἄλφιτα καὶ μέλι χλωρὸν οἴνῳ Πραμνείῳ ἐκύκα· ἀνέμισγε δὲ σίτῳ φάρμακα λύγρʼ, ἵνα πάγχυ λαθοίατο πατρίδος αἴης. αὐτὰρ ἐπεὶ δῶκέν τε καὶ ἔκπιον, αὐτίκʼ ἔπειτα ῥάβδῳ πεπληγυῖα κατὰ συφεοῖσιν ἐέργνυ. οἱ δὲ συῶν μὲν ἔχον κεφαλὰς φωνήν τε τρίχας τε καὶ δέμας, αὐτὰρ νοῦς ἦν ἔμπεδος, ὡς τὸ πάρος περ.
"""Thus then were they shut up squealing, and Circe threw them some acorns and beech masts such as pigs eat, but Eurylokhos hurried back to tell me about the sad fate of our comrades. He was so overcome with dismay that though he tried to speak he could find no words to do so; his eyes filled with tears and he could only sob and sigh, till at last we forced his story out of him, and he told us what had happened to the others."	ὣς οἱ μὲν κλαίοντες ἐέρχατο, τοῖσι δὲ Κίρκη πάρ ῥʼ ἄκυλον βάλανόν τε βάλεν καρπόν τε κρανείης ἔδμεναι, οἷα σύες χαμαιευνάδες αἰὲν ἔδουσιν.

"""‘We went,’ said he, ‘as you told us, through the forest, and in the middle of it there was a fine house built with cut stones in a place that could be seen from far. There we found a woman, or else she was a goddess, working at her loom and singing sweetly; so the men shouted to her and called her, whereon she at once came down, opened the door, and invited us in. The others did not suspect any mischief so they followed her into the house, but I stayed where I was, for I thought there might be some treachery. From that moment I saw them no more, for not one of them ever came out, though I sat a long time watching for them.’"	ἤιομεν, ὡς ἐκέλευες, ἀνὰ δρυμά, φαίδιμʼ Ὀδυσσεῦ· εὕρομεν ἐν βήσσῃσι τετυγμένα δώματα καλὰ ξεστοῖσιν λάεσσι, περισκέπτῳ ἐνὶ χώρῳ. ἔνθα δέ τις μέγαν ἱστὸν ἐποιχομένη λίγʼ ἄειδεν, ἢ θεὸς ἠὲ γυνή· τοὶ δὲ φθέγγοντο καλεῦντες. ἡ δʼ αἶψʼ ἐξελθοῦσα θύρας ὤιξε φαεινὰς καὶ κάλει· οἱ δʼ ἅμα πάντες ἀιδρείῃσιν ἕποντο· αὐτὰρ ἐγὼν ὑπέμεινα, ὀισάμενος δόλον εἶναι. οἱ δʼ ἅμʼ ἀιστώθησαν ἀολλέες, οὐδέ τις αὐτῶν ἐξεφάνη· δηρὸν δὲ καθήμενος ἐσκοπίαζον.
"""Then I took my sword of bronze and slung it over my shoulders; I also took my bow, and told Eurylokhos to come back with me and show me the way. But he laid hold of me with both his hands and spoke piteously, saying, ‘Sir, do not force me to go with you, but let me stay here, for I know you will not bring one of them back with you, nor even return alive yourself; let us rather see if we cannot escape at any rate with the few that are left us, for we may still save our lives.’"	ὣς ἔφατʼ, αὐτὰρ ἐγὼ περὶ μὲν ξίφος ἀργυρόηλον ὤμοιιν βαλόμην, μέγα χάλκεον, ἀμφὶ δὲ τόξα· τὸν δʼ ἂψ ἠνώγεα αὐτὴν ὁδὸν ἡγήσασθαι. αὐτὰρ ὅ γʼ ἀμφοτέρῃσι λαβὼν ἐλλίσσετο γούνων καί μʼ ὀλοφυρόμενος ἔπεα πτερόεντα προσηύδα· μή μʼ ἄγε κεῖσʼ ἀέκοντα, διοτρεφές, ἀλλὰ λίπʼ αὐτοῦ. οἶδα γάρ, ὡς οὔτʼ αὐτὸς ἐλεύσεαι οὔτε τινʼ ἄλλον ἄξεις σῶν ἑτάρων. ἀλλὰ ξὺν τοίσδεσι θᾶσσον φεύγωμεν· ἔτι γάρ κεν ἀλύξαιμεν κακὸν ἦμαρ.
"""‘Stay where you are, then,’ answered I, ‘eating and drinking at the ship, but I must go, for I am most urgently bound to do so.’"	ὣς ἔφατʼ, αὐτὰρ ἐγώ μιν ἀμειβόμενος προσέειπον· Εὐρύλοχʼ, ἦ τοι μὲν σὺ μένʼ αὐτοῦ τῷδʼ ἐνὶ χώρῳ ἔσθων καὶ πίνων κοίλῃ παρὰ νηὶ μελαίνῃ· αὐτὰρ ἐγὼν εἶμι, κρατερὴ δέ μοι ἔπλετʼ ἀνάγκη.
"""With this I left the ship and went up inland. When I got through the charmed grove, and was near the great house of the enchantress Circe, I met Hermes with his golden wand, disguised as a young man in the hey-day of his youth and beauty with the down just coming upon his face. He came up to me and took my hand within his own, saying, ‘My poor unhappy man, whither are you going over this mountain top, alone and without knowing the way? Your men are shut up in Circe's pigsties, like so many wild boars in their lairs. You surely do not fancy that you can set them free? I can tell you that you will never get back and will have to stay there with the rest of them. But never mind, I will protect you and get you out of your difficulty. Take this herb, which is one of great virtue, and keep it about you when you go to Circe's house, it will be a talisman to you against every kind of mischief."	ὣς εἰπὼν παρὰ νηὸς ἀνήιον ἠδὲ θαλάσσης. ἀλλʼ ὅτε δὴ ἄρʼ ἔμελλον ἰὼν ἱερὰς ἀνὰ βήσσας Κίρκης ἵξεσθαι πολυφαρμάκου ἐς μέγα δῶμα, ἔνθα μοι Ἑρμείας χρυσόρραπις ἀντεβόλησεν ἐρχομένῳ πρὸς δῶμα, νεηνίῃ ἀνδρὶ ἐοικώς, πρῶτον ὑπηνήτῃ, τοῦ περ χαριεστάτη ἥβη· ἔν τʼ ἄρα μοι φῦ χειρί, ἔπος τʼ ἔφατʼ ἔκ τʼ ὀνόμαζε· πῇ δὴ αὖτʼ, ὦ δύστηνε, διʼ ἄκριας ἔρχεαι οἶος, χώρου ἄιδρις ἐών; ἕταροι δέ τοι οἵδʼ ἐνὶ Κίρκης ἔρχαται ὥς τε σύες πυκινοὺς κευθμῶνας ἔχοντες. ἦ τοὺς λυσόμενος δεῦρʼ ἔρχεαι; οὐδέ σέ φημι αὐτὸν νοστήσειν, μενέεις δὲ σύ γʼ, ἔνθα περ ἄλλοι. ἀλλʼ ἄγε δή σε κακῶν ἐκλύσομαι ἠδὲ σαώσω. τῆ, τόδε φάρμακον ἐσθλὸν ἔχων ἐς δώματα Κίρκης ἔρχευ, ὅ κέν τοι κρατὸς ἀλάλκῃσιν κακὸν ἦμαρ.
"""‘And I will tell you of all the wicked witchcraft that Circe will try to practice upon you.

I will tell you all about it. When Circe strikes you with her wand, draw your sword and spring upon her as though you were goings to kill her. She will then be frightened and will desire you to go to bed with her; on this you must not point blank refuse her, for you want her to set your companions free, and to take good care also of yourself, but you make her swear solemnly by all the blessed that she will plot no further mischief against you, or else when she has got you naked she will unman you and make you fit for nothing.’"	πάντα δέ τοι ἐρέω ὀλοφώια δήνεα Κίρκης. τεύξει τοι κυκεῶ, βαλέει δʼ ἐν φάρμακα σίτῳ. ἀλλʼ οὐδʼ ὣς θέλξαι σε δυνήσεται· οὐ γὰρ ἐάσει φάρμακον ἐσθλόν, ὅ τοι δώσω, ἐρέω δὲ ἕκαστα. ὁππότε κεν Κίρκη σʼ ἐλάσῃ περιμήκεϊ ῥάβδῳ, δὴ τότε σὺ ξίφος ὀξὺ ἐρυσσάμενος παρὰ μηροῦ Κίρκῃ ἐπαῖξαι, ὥς τε κτάμεναι μενεαίνων. ἡ δέ σʼ ὑποδείσασα κελήσεται εὐνηθῆναι· ἔνθα σὺ μηκέτʼ ἔπειτʼ ἀπανήνασθαι θεοῦ εὐνήν, ὄφρα κέ τοι λύσῃ θʼ ἑτάρους αὐτόν τε κομίσσῃ· ἀλλὰ κέλεσθαί μιν μακάρων μέγαν ὅρκον ὀμόσσαι, μή τί τοι αὐτῷ πῆμα κακὸν βουλευσέμεν ἄλλο, μή σʼ ἀπογυμνωθέντα κακὸν καὶ ἀνήνορα θήῃ.
"""As he spoke he pulled the herb out of the ground an showed me what it was like. The root was black, while the flower was as white as milk; the gods call it Moly, and mortal men cannot uproot it, but the gods can do whatever they like."	ὣς ἄρα φωνήσας πόρε φάρμακον ἀργεϊφόντης ἐκ γαίης ἐρύσας, καί μοι φύσιν αὐτοῦ ἔδειξε. ῥίζῃ μὲν μέλαν ἔσκε, γάλακτι δὲ εἴκελον ἄνθος· μῶλυ δέ μιν καλέουσι θεοί· χαλεπὸν δέ τʼ ὀρύσσειν ἀνδράσι γε θνητοῖσι, θεοὶ δέ τε πάντα δύνανται.
"""Then Hermes went back to high Olympus passing over the wooded island; but I fared onward to the house of Circe, and my heart was clouded with care as I walked along. When I got to the gates I stood there and called the goddess, and as soon as she heard me she came down, opened the door, and asked me to come in; so I followed her - much troubled in my mind. She set me on a richly decorated seat inlaid with silver, there was a footstool also under my feet, and she mixed a mess in a golden goblet for me to drink; but she drugged it, for she meant me mischief. When she had given it me, and I had drunk it without its charming me, she struck me with her wand. ‘There now,’ she cried, ‘be off to the pigsty, and make your lair with the rest of them.’"	Ἑρμείας μὲν ἔπειτʼ ἀπέβη πρὸς μακρὸν Ὄλυμπον νῆσον ἀνʼ ὑλήεσσαν, ἐγὼ δʼ ἐς δώματα Κίρκης ἤια, πολλὰ δέ μοι κραδίη πόρφυρε κιόντι. ἔστην δʼ εἰνὶ θύρῃσι θεᾶς καλλιπλοκάμοιο· ἔνθα στὰς ἐβόησα, θεὰ δέ μευ ἔκλυεν αὐδῆς. ἡ δʼ αἶψʼ ἐξελθοῦσα θύρας ὤιξε φαεινὰς καὶ κάλει· αὐτὰρ ἐγὼν ἑπόμην ἀκαχήμενος ἦτορ. εἷσε δέ μʼ εἰσαγαγοῦσα ἐπὶ θρόνου ἀργυροήλου καλοῦ δαιδαλέου· ὑπὸ δὲ θρῆνυς ποσὶν ἦεν· τεῦχε δέ μοι κυκεῶ χρυσέῳ δέπαι, ὄφρα πίοιμι, ἐν δέ τε φάρμακον ἧκε, κακὰ φρονέουσʼ ἐνὶ θυμῷ. αὐτὰρ ἐπεὶ δῶκέν τε καὶ ἔκπιον, οὐδέ μʼ ἔθελξε, ῥάβδῳ πεπληγυῖα ἔπος τʼ ἔφατʼ ἔκ τʼ ὀνόμαζεν· ἔρχεο νῦν συφεόνδε, μετʼ ἄλλων λέξο ἑταίρων.

"""Meanwhile her four servants, who are her housemaids, set about their work. They are the children of the groves and fountains, and of the holy waters that run down into the sea. One of them spread a fair purple cloth over a seat, and laid a carpet underneath it. Another brought tables of silver up to the seats, and set them with baskets of gold. A third mixed some sweet wine with water in a silver bowl and put golden cups upon the tables, while the fourth brought in water and set it to boil in a large cauldron over a good fire which she had lighted. When the water in the cauldron was boiling, she poured cold into it till it was just as I liked it, and then she set me in a bath and began washing me from the cauldron about the head and shoulders, to take the tire and stiffness out of my limbs. As soon as she had done washing me and anointing me with oil, she arrayed me in a good cloak and shirt and led me to a richly decorated seat inlaid with silver; there was a footstool also under my feet. A maid servant then brought me water in a beautiful golden ewer and poured it into a silver basin for me to wash my hands, and she drew a clean table beside me; an upper servant brought me bread and offered me many things of what there was in the house, and then Circe bade me eat, but I would not, and sat without heeding what was before me, still moody and suspicious."	ἀμφίπολοι δʼ ἄρα τέως μὲν ἐνὶ μεγάροισι πένοντο τέσσαρες, αἵ οἱ δῶμα κάτα δρήστειραι ἔασι· γίγνονται δʼ ἄρα ταί γʼ ἔκ τε κρηνέων ἀπό τʼ ἀλσέων ἔκ θʼ ἱερῶν ποταμῶν, οἵ τʼ εἰς ἅλαδε προρέουσι. τάων ἡ μὲν ἔβαλλε θρόνοις ἔνι ῥήγεα καλὰ πορφύρεα καθύπερθʼ, ὑπένερθε δὲ λῖθʼ ὑπέβαλλεν· ἡ δʼ ἑτέρη προπάροιθε θρόνων ἐτίταινε τραπέζας ἀργυρέας, ἐπὶ δέ σφι τίθει χρύσεια κάνεια· ἡ δὲ τρίτη κρητῆρι μελίφρονα οἶνον ἐκίρνα ἡδὺν ἐν ἀργυρέῳ, νέμε δὲ χρύσεια κύπελλα· ἡ δὲ τετάρτη ὕδωρ ἐφόρει καὶ πῦρ ἀνέκαιε πολλὸν ὑπὸ τρίποδι μεγάλῳ· ἰαίνετο δʼ ὕδωρ. αὐτὰρ ἐπεὶ δὴ ζέσσεν ὕδωρ ἐνὶ ἤνοπι χαλκῷ, ἔς ῥʼ ἀσάμινθον ἕσασα λόʼ ἐκ τρίποδος μεγάλοιο, θυμῆρες κεράσασα, κατὰ κρατός τε καὶ ὤμων, ὄφρα μοι ἐκ κάματον θυμοφθόρον εἵλετο γυίων. αὐτὰρ ἐπεὶ λοῦσέν τε καὶ ἔχρισεν λίπʼ ἐλαίῳ, ἀμφὶ δέ με χλαῖναν καλὴν βάλεν ἠδὲ χιτῶνα, εἷσε δέ μʼ εἰσαγαγοῦσα ἐπὶ θρόνου ἀργυροήλου καλοῦ δαιδαλέου, ὑπὸ δὲ θρῆνυς ποσὶν ἦεν· χέρνιβα δʼ ἀμφίπολος προχόῳ ἐπέχευε φέρουσα καλῇ χρυσείῃ, ὑπὲρ ἀργυρέοιο λέβητος, νίψασθαι· παρὰ δὲ ξεστὴν ἐτάνυσσε τράπεζαν. σῖτον δʼ αἰδοίη ταμίη παρέθηκε φέρουσα, εἴδατα πόλλʼ ἐπιθεῖσα, χαριζομένη παρεόντων. ἐσθέμεναι δʼ ἐκέλευεν· ἐμῷ δʼ οὐχ ἥνδανε θυμῷ, ἀλλʼ ἥμην ἀλλοφρονέων, κακὰ δʼ ὄσσετο θυμός.
"""When Circe saw me sitting there without eating, and in great grief  , she came to me and said, ‘Odysseus, why do you sit like that as though you were dumb, gnawing at your own heart, and refusing both meat and drink? Is it that you are still suspicious? You ought not to be, for I have already sworn solemnly that I will not hurt you.’"	Κίρκη δʼ ὡς ἐνόησεν ἔμʼ ἥμενον οὐδʼ ἐπὶ σίτῳ χεῖρας ἰάλλοντα, κρατερὸν δέ με πένθος ἔχοντα, ἄγχι παρισταμένη ἔπεα πτερόεντα προσηύδα· τίφθʼ οὕτως, Ὀδυσεῦ, κατʼ ἄρʼ ἕζεαι ἶσος ἀναύδῳ, θυμὸν ἔδων, βρώμης δʼ οὐχ ἅπτεαι οὐδὲ ποτῆτος; ἦ τινά που δόλον ἄλλον ὀίεαι· οὐδέ τί σε χρὴ δειδίμεν· ἤδη γάρ τοι ἀπώμοσα καρτερὸν ὅρκον.
"""And I said, ‘Circe, no man with any sense of what is right can think of either eating or drinking in your house until you have set his friends free and let him see them. If you want me to eat and drink, you must free my men and bring them to me that I may see them with my own eyes.’"	ὣς ἔφατʼ, αὐτὰρ ἐγώ μιν ἀμειβόμενος προσέειπον· ὦ Κίρκη, τίς γάρ κεν ἀνήρ, ὃς ἐναίσιμος εἴη, πρὶν τλαίη πάσσασθαι ἐδητύος ἠδὲ ποτῆτος, πρὶν λύσασθʼ ἑτάρους καὶ ἐν ὀφθαλμοῖσιν ἰδέσθαι; ἀλλʼ εἰ δὴ πρόφρασσα πιεῖν φαγέμεν τε κελεύεις, λῦσον, ἵνʼ ὀφθαλμοῖσιν ἴδω ἐρίηρας ἑταίρους.
"""When I had said this she went straight through the court with her wand in her hand and opened the pigsty doors. My men came out like so many prime hogs and stood looking at her, but she went about among them and anointed each with a second drug, whereon the bristles that the bad drug had given them fell off, and they became men again, younger than they were before, and much taller and better looking. They knew me at once, seized me each of them by the hand, and wept for joy till the whole house was filled with the sound of their wailing, and Circe herself was so sorry for them that she came up to me and said, ‘Odysseus, noble son of Laertes , go back at once to the sea where you have left your ship, and first draw it on to the land. Then, hide all your ship's gear and property in some cave, and come back here with your men.’"	ὣς ἐφάμην, Κίρκη δὲ διὲκ μεγάροιο βεβήκει ῥάβδον ἔχουσʼ ἐν χειρί, θύρας δʼ ἀνέῳξε συφειοῦ, ἐκ δʼ ἔλασεν σιάλοισιν ἐοικότας ἐννεώροισιν. οἱ μὲν ἔπειτʼ ἔστησαν ἐναντίοι, ἡ δὲ διʼ αὐτῶν ἐρχομένη προσάλειφεν ἑκάστῳ φάρμακον ἄλλο. τῶν δʼ ἐκ μὲν μελέων τρίχες ἔρρεον, ἃς πρὶν ἔφυσε φάρμακον οὐλόμενον, τό σφιν πόρε πότνια Κίρκη· ἄνδρες δʼ ἂψ ἐγένοντο νεώτεροι ἢ πάρος ἦσαν, καὶ πολὺ καλλίονες καὶ μείζονες εἰσοράασθαι. ἔγνωσαν δέ μʼ ἐκεῖνοι ἔφυν τʼ ἐν χερσὶν ἕκαστος. πᾶσιν δʼ ἱμερόεις ὑπέδυ γόος, ἀμφὶ δὲ δῶμα σμερδαλέον κονάβιζε· θεὰ δʼ ἐλέαιρε καὶ αὐτή. ἡ δέ μευ ἄγχι στᾶσα προσηύδα δῖα θεάων· διογενὲς Λαερτιάδη, πολυμήχανʼ Ὀδυσσεῦ, ἔρχεο νῦν ἐπὶ νῆα θοὴν καὶ θῖνα θαλάσσης. νῆα μὲν ἂρ πάμπρωτον ἐρύσσατε ἤπειρόνδε, κτήματα δʼ ἐν σπήεσσι πελάσσατε ὅπλα τε πάντα· αὐτὸς δʼ ἂψ ἰέναι καὶ ἄγειν ἐρίηρας ἑταίρους.
"""I agreed to this, so I went back to the sea shore, and found the men at the ship weeping and wailing most piteously. When they saw me the silly blubbering men began frisking round me as calves break out and gambol round their mothers, when they see them coming home to be milked after they have been feeding all day, and the homestead resounds with their lowing. They seemed as glad to see me as though they had got back to their own rugged Ithaca , where they had been born and bred. ‘Sir,’ said the affectionate creatures, ‘we are as glad to see you back as though we had got safe home to Ithaca ; but tell us all about the fate of our comrades.’"	ὣς ἔφατʼ, αὐτὰρ ἐμοί γʼ ἐπεπείθετο θυμὸς ἀγήνωρ, βῆν δʼ ἰέναι ἐπὶ νῆα θοὴν καὶ θῖνα θαλάσσης. εὗρον ἔπειτʼ ἐπὶ νηὶ θοῇ ἐρίηρας ἑταίρους οἴκτρʼ ὀλοφυρομένους, θαλερὸν κατὰ δάκρυ χέοντας. ὡς δʼ ὅτʼ ἂν ἄγραυλοι πόριες περὶ βοῦς ἀγελαίας, ἐλθούσας ἐς κόπρον, ἐπὴν βοτάνης κορέσωνται, πᾶσαι ἅμα σκαίρουσιν ἐναντίαι· οὐδʼ ἔτι σηκοὶ ἴσχουσʼ, ἀλλʼ ἁδινὸν μυκώμεναι ἀμφιθέουσι· μητέρας· ὣς ἔμʼ ἐκεῖνοι ἐπεὶ ἴδον ὀφθαλμοῖσι, δακρυόεντες ἔχυντο· δόκησε δʼ ἄρα σφίσι θυμὸς ὣς ἔμεν, ὡς εἰ πατρίδʼ ἱκοίατο καὶ πόλιν αὐτὴν τρηχείης Ἰθάκης, ἵνα τʼ ἔτραφεν ἠδʼ ἐγένοντο. καί μʼ ὀλοφυρόμενοι ἔπεα πτερόεντα προσηύδων· σοὶ μὲν νοστήσαντι, διοτρεφές, ὣς ἐχάρημεν, ὡς εἴ τʼ εἰς Ἰθάκην ἀφικοίμεθα πατρίδα γαῖαν· ἀλλʼ ἄγε, τῶν ἄλλων ἑτάρων κατάλεξον ὄλεθρον.
"""I spoke comfortingly to them and said, ‘We must draw our ship on to the land, and hide the ship's gear with all our property in some cave; then come with me all of you as fast as you can to Circe's house, where you will find your comrades eating and drinking in the midst of great abundance.’"	ὣς ἔφαν, αὐτὰρ ἐγὼ προσέφην μαλακοῖς ἐπέεσσι· νῆα μὲν ἂρ πάμπρωτον ἐρύσσομεν ἤπειρόνδε, κτήματα δʼ ἐν σπήεσσι πελάσσομεν ὅπλα τε πάντα· αὐτοὶ δʼ ὀτρύνεσθε ἐμοὶ ἅμα πάντες ἕπεσθαι, ὄφρα ἴδηθʼ ἑτάρους ἱεροῖς ἐν δώμασι Κίρκης πίνοντας καὶ ἔδοντας· ἐπηετανὸν γὰρ ἔχουσιν.
"""On this the men would have come with me at once, but Eurylokhos tried to hold them back and said, ‘Alas, poor wretches that we are, what will become of us? Rush not on your ruin by going to the house of Circe, who will turn us all into pigs or wolves or lions, and we shall have to keep guard over her house. Remember how the Cyclops treated us when our comrades went inside his cave, and Odysseus with them. It was all through his sheer folly that those men lost their lives.’"	ὣς ἐφάμην, οἱ δʼ ὦκα ἐμοῖς ἐπέεσσι πίθοντο.

"""When I heard him I was in two minds whether or no to draw the keen blade that hung by my sturdy thigh and cut his head off in spite of his being a near relation of my own; but the men interceded for him and said, ‘Sir, if it may so be, let this man stay here and mind the ship, but take the rest of us with you to Circe's house.’"	ὣς ἔφατʼ, αὐτὰρ ἐγώ γε μετὰ φρεσὶ μερμήριξα, σπασσάμενος τανύηκες ἄορ παχέος παρὰ μηροῦ, τῷ οἱ ἀποπλήξας κεφαλὴν οὖδάσδε πελάσσαι, καὶ πηῷ περ ἐόντι μάλα σχεδόν· ἀλλά μʼ ἑταῖροι μειλιχίοις ἐπέεσσιν ἐρήτυον ἄλλοθεν ἄλλος· διογενές, τοῦτον μὲν ἐάσομεν, εἰ σὺ κελεύεις, αὐτοῦ πὰρ νηί τε μένειν καὶ νῆα ἔρυσθαι· ἡμῖν δʼ ἡγεμόνευʼ ἱερὰ πρὸς δώματα Κίρκης.
"""On this we all went inland, and Eurylokhos was not left behind after all, but came on too, for he was frightened by the severe reprimand that I had given him."	ὣς φάμενοι παρὰ νηὸς ἀνήιον ἠδὲ θαλάσσης. οὐδὲ μὲν Εὐρύλοχος κοίλῃ παρὰ νηὶ λέλειπτο, ἀλλʼ ἕπετʼ· ἔδεισεν γὰρ ἐμὴν ἔκπαγλον ἐνιπήν.
"""Meanwhile Circe had been seeing that the men who had been left behind were washed and anointed with olive oil; she had also given them woolen cloaks and shirts, and when we came we found them all comfortably at dinner in her house. As soon as the men saw each other face to face and knew one another, they wept for joy and cried aloud till the whole palace rang again. Thereon Circe came up to me and said, ‘Odysseus, noble son of Laertes , tell your men to leave off crying; I know how much you have all of you suffered at sea, and how ill you have fared among cruel savages on the mainland, but that is over now, so stay here, and eat and drink till you are once more as strong and hearty as you were when you left Ithaca ; for at present you are weakened both in body and mind; you keep all the time thinking of the hardships - you have suffered during your travels, so that you have no more cheerfulness left in you.’"	τόφρα δὲ τοὺς ἄλλους ἑτάρους ἐν δώμασι Κίρκη ἐνδυκέως λοῦσέν τε καὶ ἔχρισεν λίπʼ ἐλαίῳ, ἀμφὶ δʼ ἄρα χλαίνας οὔλας βάλεν ἠδὲ χιτῶνας· δαινυμένους δʼ ἐὺ πάντας ἐφεύρομεν ἐν μεγάροισιν. οἱ δʼ ἐπεὶ ἀλλήλους εἶδον φράσσαντό τʼ ἐσάντα, κλαῖον ὀδυρόμενοι, περὶ δὲ στεναχίζετο δῶμα. ἡ δέ μευ ἄγχι στᾶσα προσηύδα δῖα θεάων· μηκέτι νῦν θαλερὸν γόον ὄρνυτε· οἶδα καὶ αὐτὴ ἠμὲν ὅσʼ ἐν πόντῳ πάθετʼ ἄλγεα ἰχθυόεντι, ἠδʼ ὅσʼ ἀνάρσιοι ἄνδρες ἐδηλήσαντʼ ἐπὶ χέρσου. ἀλλʼ ἄγετʼ ἐσθίετε βρώμην καὶ πίνετε οἶνον, εἰς ὅ κεν αὖτις θυμὸν ἐνὶ στήθεσσι λάβητε, οἷον ὅτε πρώτιστον ἐλείπετε πατρίδα γαῖαν τρηχείης Ἰθάκης. νῦν δʼ ἀσκελέες καὶ ἄθυμοι, αἰὲν ἄλης χαλεπῆς μεμνημένοι, οὐδέ ποθʼ ὕμιν θυμὸς ἐν εὐφροσύνῃ, ἐπεὶ ἦ μάλα πολλὰ πέποσθε.
"""Thus did she speak and we assented. We stayed with Circe for a whole twelvemonth feasting upon an untold quantity both of meat and wine. But when the year had passed, and the seasons   had turned round, and the waning of moons and the long days had begun, my men called me apart and said, ‘Sir, it is time you began to think about going home, if so be you are to be spared to see your house and native country at all.’"	ὣς ἔφαθʼ, ἡμῖν δʼ αὖτʼ ἐπεπείθετο θυμὸς ἀγήνωρ. ἔνθα μὲν ἤματα πάντα τελεσφόρον εἰς ἐνιαυτὸν ἥμεθα δαινύμενοι κρέα τʼ ἄσπετα καὶ μέθυ ἡδύ· ἀλλʼ ὅτε δή ῥʼ ἐνιαυτὸς ἔην, περὶ δʼ ἔτραπον ὧραι μηνῶν φθινόντων, περὶ δʼ ἤματα μακρὰ τελέσθη, καὶ τότε μʼ ἐκκαλέσαντες ἔφαν ἐρίηρες ἑταῖροι· δαιμόνιʼ, ἤδη νῦν μιμνήσκεο πατρίδος αἴης, εἴ τοι θέσφατόν ἐστι σαωθῆναι καὶ ἱκέσθαι οἶκον ἐς ὑψόροφον καὶ σὴν ἐς πατρίδα γαῖαν.
"""Thus did they speak and I assented. Thereon through the livelong day to the going down of the sun we feasted our fill on meat and wine, but when the sun went down and it came on dark the men laid themselves down to sleep in the covered cloisters. I, however, after I had got into bed with Circe, besought her by her knees, and the goddess listened to what I had got to say. ‘Circe,’ said I, ‘please keep the promise you made me about furthering me on my homeward voyage. I want to get back and so do my men, they are always pestering me with their complaints as soon as ever your back is turned.’"	ὣς ἔφαν, αὐτὰρ ἐμοί γʼ ἐπεπείθετο θυμὸς ἀγήνωρ. ὣς τότε μὲν πρόπαν ἦμαρ ἐς ἠέλιον καταδύντα ἥμεθα, δαινύμενοι κρέα τʼ ἄσπετα καὶ μέθυ ἡδύ· ἦμος δʼ ἠέλιος κατέδυ καὶ ἐπὶ κνέφας ἦλθεν, οἱ μὲν κοιμήσαντο κατὰ μέγαρα σκιόεντα. αὐτὰρ ἐγὼ Κίρκης ἐπιβὰς περικαλλέος εὐνῆς γούνων ἐλλιτάνευσα, θεὰ δέ μευ ἔκλυεν αὐδῆς· καί μιν φωνήσας ἔπεα πτερόεντα προσηύδων· ὢ Κίρκη, τέλεσόν μοι ὑπόσχεσιν ἥν περ ὑπέστης, οἴκαδε πεμψέμεναι· θυμὸς δέ μοι ἔσσυται ἤδη, ἠδʼ ἄλλων ἑτάρων, οἵ μευ φθινύθουσι φίλον κῆρ ἀμφʼ ἔμʼ ὀδυρόμενοι, ὅτε που σύ γε νόσφι γένηαι.
"""And the goddess answered, ‘Odysseus, noble son of Laertes , you shall none of you stay here any longer if you do not want to, but there is another journey which you have got to take before you can sail homewards. You must go to the house of Hades and of dread Persephone to consult the ghost   of the blind Theban seer   Teiresias whose mind   is still in place within him. To him alone has Persephone left his consciousness   even in death, but the other ghosts flit about aimlessly.’"	ὣς ἐφάμην, ἡ δʼ αὐτίκʼ ἀμείβετο δῖα θεάων· διογενὲς Λαερτιάδη, πολυμήχανʼ Ὀδυσσεῦ, μηκέτι νῦν ἀέκοντες ἐμῷ ἐνὶ μίμνετε οἴκῳ. ἀλλʼ ἄλλην χρὴ πρῶτον ὁδὸν τελέσαι καὶ ἱκέσθαι εἰς Ἀίδαο δόμους καὶ ἐπαινῆς Περσεφονείης, ψυχῇ χρησομένους Θηβαίου Τειρεσίαο, μάντηος ἀλαοῦ, τοῦ τε φρένες ἔμπεδοί εἰσι· τῷ καὶ τεθνηῶτι νόον πόρε Περσεφόνεια, οἴῳ πεπνῦσθαι, τοὶ δὲ σκιαὶ ἀίσσουσιν.
"""I was dismayed when I heard this. I sat up in bed and wept, and would gladly have lived no longer to see the light of the sun, but presently when I was tired of weeping and tossing myself about, I said, ‘And who shall guide me upon this voyage - for the house of Hades is a port that no ship can reach.’"	ὣς ἔφατʼ, αὐτὰρ ἐμοί γε κατεκλάσθη φίλον ἦτορ· κλαῖον δʼ ἐν λεχέεσσι καθήμενος, οὐδέ νύ μοι κῆρ ἤθελʼ ἔτι ζώειν καὶ ὁρᾶν φάος ἠελίοιο. αὐτὰρ ἐπεὶ κλαίων τε κυλινδόμενος τʼ ἐκορέσθην, καὶ τότε δή μιν ἔπεσσιν ἀμειβόμενος προσέειπον· ὢ Κίρκη, τίς γὰρ ταύτην ὁδὸν ἡγεμονεύσει; εἰς Ἄϊδος δʼ οὔ πώ τις ἀφίκετο νηὶ μελαίνῃ. ὣς ἐφάμην, ἡ δʼ αὐτίκʼ ἀμείβετο δῖα θεάων·

You will find it near the place where the rivers Pyriphlegethon and Cocytus (which is a branch of the river Styx) flow into Acheron, and you will see a rock near it, just where the two roaring rivers run into one another."	διογενὲς Λαερτιάδη, πολυμήχανʼ Ὀδυσσεῦ, μή τί τοι ἡγεμόνος γε ποθὴ παρὰ νηὶ μελέσθω, ἱστὸν δὲ στήσας, ἀνά θʼ ἱστία λευκὰ πετάσσας ἧσθαι· τὴν δέ κέ τοι πνοιὴ Βορέαο φέρῃσιν. ἀλλʼ ὁπότʼ ἂν δὴ νηὶ διʼ Ὠκεανοῖο περήσῃς, ἔνθʼ ἀκτή τε λάχεια καὶ ἄλσεα Περσεφονείης, μακραί τʼ αἴγειροι καὶ ἰτέαι ὠλεσίκαρποι, νῆα μὲν αὐτοῦ κέλσαι ἐπʼ Ὠκεανῷ βαθυδίνῃ, αὐτὸς δʼ εἰς Ἀίδεω ἰέναι δόμον εὐρώεντα. ἔνθα μὲν εἰς Ἀχέροντα Πυριφλεγέθων τε ῥέουσιν Κώκυτός θʼ, ὃς δὴ Στυγὸς ὕδατός ἐστιν ἀπορρώξ, πέτρη τε ξύνεσίς τε δύω ποταμῶν ἐριδούπων·

Moreover you must offer many prayers to the poor feeble ghosts, and promise them that when you get back to Ithaca you will sacrifice a barren heifer to them, the best you have, and will load the pyre with good things.

When he heard the noise of the men bustling about, he jumped up on a sudden and forgot all about coming down by the main staircase, so he tumbled right off the roof and broke his neck, and his soul   went down to the house of Hades."	οὐδὲ μὲν οὐδʼ ἔνθεν περ ἀπήμονας ἦγον ἑταίρους.

Circe, that great and cunning goddess, sent us a fair wind that blew dead aft and stayed steadily with us keeping our sails all the time well filled; so we did whatever wanted doing to the ship's gear and let her go as the wind and helmsman headed her. All day long her sails were full as she held her course over the sea, but when the sun went down and darkness was over all the earth, we got into the deep waters of the river Okeanos, where lie the and city of the Cimmerians who live enshrouded in mist and darkness which the rays of the sun never pierce neither at his rising nor as he goes down again out of the heavens, but the poor wretches live in one long melancholy night. When we got there we beached the ship, took the sheep out of her, and went along by the waters of Okeanos till we came to the place of which Circe had told us.	αὐτὰρ ἐπεί ῥʼ ἐπὶ νῆα κατήλθομεν ἠδὲ θάλασσαν, νῆα μὲν ἂρ πάμπρωτον ἐρύσσαμεν εἰς ἅλα δῖαν, ἐν δʼ ἱστὸν τιθέμεσθα καὶ ἱστία νηὶ μελαίνῃ, ἐν δὲ τὰ μῆλα λαβόντες ἐβήσαμεν, ἂν δὲ καὶ αὐτοὶ βαίνομεν ἀχνύμενοι θαλερὸν κατὰ δάκρυ χέοντες. ἡμῖν δʼ αὖ κατόπισθε νεὸς κυανοπρῴροιο ἴκμενον οὖρον ἵει πλησίστιον, ἐσθλὸν ἑταῖρον, Κίρκη εὐπλόκαμος, δεινὴ θεὸς αὐδήεσσα. ἡμεῖς δʼ ὅπλα ἕκαστα πονησάμενοι κατὰ νῆα ἥμεθα· τὴν δʼ ἄνεμός τε κυβερνήτης τʼ ἴθυνε. τῆς δὲ πανημερίης τέταθʼ ἱστία ποντοπορούσης· δύσετό τʼ ἠέλιος σκιόωντό τε πᾶσαι ἀγυιαί. ἡ δʼ ἐς πείραθʼ ἵκανε βαθυρρόου Ὠκεανοῖο. ἔνθα δὲ Κιμμερίων ἀνδρῶν δῆμός τε πόλις τε, ἠέρι καὶ νεφέλῃ κεκαλυμμένοι· οὐδέ ποτʼ αὐτοὺς ἠέλιος φαέθων καταδέρκεται ἀκτίνεσσιν, οὔθʼ ὁπότʼ ἂν στείχῃσι πρὸς οὐρανὸν ἀστερόεντα, οὔθʼ ὅτʼ ἂν ἂψ ἐπὶ γαῖαν ἀπʼ οὐρανόθεν προτράπηται, ἀλλʼ ἐπὶ νὺξ ὀλοὴ τέταται δειλοῖσι βροτοῖσι. νῆα μὲν ἔνθʼ ἐλθόντες ἐκέλσαμεν, ἐκ δὲ τὰ μῆλα εἱλόμεθʼ· αὐτοὶ δʼ αὖτε παρὰ ῥόον Ὠκεανοῖο ᾔομεν, ὄφρʼ ἐς χῶρον ἀφικόμεθʼ, ὃν φράσε Κίρκη.
"""Here Perimedes and Eurylokhos held the victims, while I drew my sword and dug the trench a cubit each way. I made a drink-offering to all the dead, first with honey and milk, then with wine, and thirdly with water, and I sprinkled white barley meal over the whole, praying earnestly to the poor feckless ghosts, and promising them that when I got back to Ithaca I would sacrifice a barren heifer for them, the best I had, and would load the pyre with good things. I also particularly promised that Teiresias should have a black sheep to himself, the best in all my flocks. When I had prayed sufficiently to the dead, I cut the throats of the two sheep and let the blood run into the trench, whereon the ghosts   came trooping up from Erebus - brides, young bachelors, old men worn out with toil, maids who had been crossed in love, and brave men who had been killed in battle, with their armor still smirched with blood; they came from every quarter and flitted round the trench with a strange kind of screaming sound that made me turn pale with fear. When I saw them coming I told the men to be quick and flay the carcasses of the two dead sheep and make burnt offerings of them, and at the same time to repeat prayers to Hades and to Persephone; but I sat where I was with my sword drawn and would not let the poor feckless ghosts come near the blood till Teiresias should have answered my questions."	ἔνθʼ ἱερήια μὲν Περιμήδης Εὐρύλοχός τε ἔσχον· ἐγὼ δʼ ἄορ ὀξὺ ἐρυσσάμενος παρὰ μηροῦ βόθρον ὄρυξʼ ὅσσον τε πυγούσιον ἔνθα καὶ ἔνθα, ἀμφʼ αὐτῷ δὲ χοὴν χεόμην πᾶσιν νεκύεσσι, πρῶτα μελικρήτῳ, μετέπειτα δὲ ἡδέι οἴνῳ, τὸ τρίτον αὖθʼ ὕδατι· ἐπὶ δʼ ἄλφιτα λευκὰ πάλυνον. πολλὰ δὲ γουνούμην νεκύων ἀμενηνὰ κάρηνα, ἐλθὼν εἰς Ἰθάκην στεῖραν βοῦν, ἥ τις ἀρίστη, ῥέξειν ἐν μεγάροισι πυρήν τʼ ἐμπλησέμεν ἐσθλῶν, Τειρεσίῃ δʼ ἀπάνευθεν ὄιν ἱερευσέμεν οἴῳ παμμέλανʼ, ὃς μήλοισι μεταπρέπει ἡμετέροισι. τοὺς δʼ ἐπεὶ εὐχωλῇσι λιτῇσί τε, ἔθνεα νεκρῶν, ἐλλισάμην, τὰ δὲ μῆλα λαβὼν ἀπεδειροτόμησα ἐς βόθρον, ῥέε δʼ αἷμα κελαινεφές· αἱ δʼ ἀγέροντο ψυχαὶ ὑπὲξ Ἐρέβευς νεκύων κατατεθνηώτων. νύμφαι τʼ ἠίθεοί τε πολύτλητοί τε γέροντες παρθενικαί τʼ ἀταλαὶ νεοπενθέα θυμὸν ἔχουσαι, πολλοὶ δʼ οὐτάμενοι χαλκήρεσιν ἐγχείῃσιν, ἄνδρες ἀρηίφατοι βεβροτωμένα τεύχεʼ ἔχοντες· οἳ πολλοὶ περὶ βόθρον ἐφοίτων ἄλλοθεν ἄλλος θεσπεσίῃ ἰαχῇ· ἐμὲ δὲ χλωρὸν δέος ᾕρει. δὴ τότʼ ἔπειθʼ ἑτάροισιν ἐποτρύνας ἐκέλευσα μῆλα, τὰ δὴ κατέκειτʼ ἐσφαγμένα νηλέι χαλκῷ, δείραντας κατακῆαι, ἐπεύξασθαι δὲ θεοῖσιν, ἰφθίμῳ τʼ Ἀΐδῃ καὶ ἐπαινῇ Περσεφονείῃ· αὐτὸς δὲ ξίφος ὀξὺ ἐρυσσάμενος παρὰ μηροῦ ἥμην, οὐδʼ εἴων νεκύων ἀμενηνὰ κάρηνα αἵματος ἆσσον ἴμεν, πρὶν Τειρεσίαο πυθέσθαι.

We had left his body unwaked and unburied in Circe's house, for other labor   was pressing us.

The sinews no longer hold the flesh and bones together; these perish in the fierceness of consuming fire as soon as life has left the body, and the soul   flits away as though it were a dream. Now, however, go back to the light of day as soon as you can, and note all these things that you may tell them to your wife hereafter.’"	ὣς ἐφάμην, ἡ δʼ αὐτίκʼ ἀμείβετο πότνια μήτηρ· ὤ μοι, τέκνον ἐμόν, περὶ πάντων κάμμορε φωτῶν, οὔ τί σε Περσεφόνεια Διὸς θυγάτηρ ἀπαφίσκει, ἀλλʼ αὕτη δίκη ἐστὶ βροτῶν, ὅτε τίς κε θάνῃσιν· οὐ γὰρ ἔτι σάρκας τε καὶ ὀστέα ἶνες ἔχουσιν, ἀλλὰ τὰ μέν τε πυρὸς κρατερὸν μένος αἰθομένοιο δαμνᾷ, ἐπεί κε πρῶτα λίπῃ λεύκʼ ὀστέα θυμός, ψυχὴ δʼ ἠύτʼ ὄνειρος ἀποπταμένη πεπότηται. ἀλλὰ φόωσδε τάχιστα λιλαίεο· ταῦτα δὲ πάντα ἴσθʼ, ἵνα καὶ μετόπισθε τεῇ εἴπῃσθα γυναικί.
"""Thus did we converse, and anon Persephone sent up the ghosts of the wives and daughters of all the most famous men. They gathered in crowds about the blood, and I considered how I might question them severally. In the end I deemed that it would be best to draw the keen blade that hung by my sturdy thigh, and keep them from all drinking the blood at once. So they came up one after the other, and each one as I questioned her told me her race and lineage."	νῶι μὲν ὣς ἐπέεσσιν ἀμειβόμεθʼ, αἱ δὲ γυναῖκες ἤλυθον, ὤτρυνεν γὰρ ἀγαυὴ Περσεφόνεια, ὅσσαι ἀριστήων ἄλοχοι ἔσαν ἠδὲ θύγατρες. αἱ δʼ ἀμφʼ αἷμα κελαινὸν ἀολλέες ἠγερέθοντο, αὐτὰρ ἐγὼ βούλευον ὅπως ἐρέοιμι ἑκάστην. ἥδε δέ μοι κατὰ θυμὸν ἀρίστη φαίνετο βουλή· σπασσάμενος τανύηκες ἄορ παχέος παρὰ μηροῦ οὐκ εἴων πίνειν ἅμα πάσας αἷμα κελαινόν. αἱ δὲ προμνηστῖναι ἐπήισαν, ἠδὲ ἑκάστη ὃν γόνον ἐξαγόρευεν· ἐγὼ δʼ ἐρέεινον ἁπάσας.
"""The first I saw was Tyro. She was daughter of Salmoneus and wife of Cretheus the son of Aeolus. She fell in love with the river Enipeus who is much the most beautiful river in the whole world. Once when she was taking a walk by his side as usual, Poseidon, disguised as her lover, lay with her at the mouth of the river, and a huge seething wave arched itself like a mountain over them to hide both woman and god, whereon he loosed her virgin girdle and laid her in a deep slumber. When the god had accomplished the deed of love, he took her hand in his own and said, ‘Tyro, rejoice in all good will; the embraces of the gods are not fruitless, and you will have fine twins about this time twelve months. Take great care of them. I am Poseidon, so now go home, but hold your tongue and do not tell any one.’"	ἔνθʼ ἦ τοι πρώτην Τυρὼ ἴδον εὐπατέρειαν, ἣ φάτο Σαλμωνῆος ἀμύμονος ἔκγονος εἶναι, φῆ δὲ Κρηθῆος γυνὴ ἔμμεναι Αἰολίδαο· ἣ ποταμοῦ ἠράσσατʼ Ἐνιπῆος θείοιο, ὃς πολὺ κάλλιστος ποταμῶν ἐπὶ γαῖαν ἵησι, καί ῥʼ ἐπʼ Ἐνιπῆος πωλέσκετο καλὰ ῥέεθρα. τῷ δʼ ἄρα εἰσάμενος γαιήοχος ἐννοσίγαιος ἐν προχοῇς ποταμοῦ παρελέξατο δινήεντος· πορφύρεον δʼ ἄρα κῦμα περιστάθη, οὔρεϊ ἶσον, κυρτωθέν, κρύψεν δὲ θεὸν θνητήν τε γυναῖκα. λῦσε δὲ παρθενίην ζώνην, κατὰ δʼ ὕπνον ἔχευεν. αὐτὰρ ἐπεί ῥʼ ἐτέλεσσε θεὸς φιλοτήσια ἔργα, ἔν τʼ ἄρα οἱ φῦ χειρί, ἔπος τʼ ἔφατʼ ἔκ τʼ ὀνόμαζε· χαῖρε, γύναι, φιλότητι· περιπλομένου δʼ ἐνιαυτοῦ τέξεις ἀγλαὰ τέκνα, ἐπεὶ οὐκ ἀποφώλιοι εὐναὶ ἀθανάτων· σὺ δὲ τοὺς κομέειν ἀτιταλλέμεναί τε. νῦν δʼ ἔρχευ πρὸς δῶμα, καὶ ἴσχεο μηδʼ ὀνομήνῃς· αὐτὰρ ἐγώ τοί εἰμι Ποσειδάων ἐνοσίχθων.
"""Then he dived under the sea, and she in due course bore Pelias and Neleus, who both of them served Zeus with all their might. Pelias was a great breeder of sheep and lived in Iolkos, but the other lived in Pylos . The rest of her children were by Cretheus, namely, Aison, Pheres, and Amythaon, who was a mighty warrior and charioteer."	ὣς εἰπὼν ὑπὸ πόντον ἐδύσετο κυμαίνοντα. ἡ δʼ ὑποκυσαμένη Πελίην τέκε καὶ Νηλῆα, τὼ κρατερὼ θεράποντε Διὸς μεγάλοιο γενέσθην ἀμφοτέρω· Πελίης μὲν ἐν εὐρυχόρῳ Ἰαωλκῷ ναῖε πολύρρηνος, ὁ δʼ ἄρʼ ἐν Πύλῳ ἠμαθόεντι. τοὺς δʼ ἑτέρους Κρηθῆι τέκεν βασίλεια γυναικῶν, Αἴσονά τʼ ἠδὲ Φέρητʼ Ἀμυθάονά θʼ ἱππιοχάρμην.
"""Next to her I saw Antiope, daughter to Asopos, who could boast of having slept in the arms of even Zeus himself, and who bore him two sons Amphion and Zethos. These founded Thebes with its seven gates, and built a wall all round it; for strong though they were they could not hold Thebes till they had walled it."	τὴν δὲ μετʼ Ἀντιόπην ἴδον, Ἀσωποῖο θύγατρα, ἣ δὴ καὶ Διὸς εὔχετʼ ἐν ἀγκοίνῃσιν ἰαῦσαι, καί ῥʼ ἔτεκεν δύο παῖδʼ, Ἀμφίονά τε Ζῆθόν τε, οἳ πρῶτοι Θήβης ἕδος ἔκτισαν ἑπταπύλοιο, πύργωσάν τʼ, ἐπεὶ οὐ μὲν ἀπύργωτόν γʼ ἐδύναντο ναιέμεν εὐρύχορον Θήβην, κρατερώ περ ἐόντε.

"""I also saw fair Epikaste mother of king Oedipus whose awful lot it was to marry her own son without suspecting it in her . He married her after having killed his father, but the gods proclaimed the whole story to the world; whereon he remained king of Thebes , in great grief for the spite the gods had borne him; but Epikaste went to the house of the mighty gatekeeper Hades, having hanged herself for grief, and the avenging spirits haunted him as for an outraged mother - to his ruing bitterly thereafter."	μητέρα τʼ Οἰδιπόδαο ἴδον, καλὴν Ἐπικάστην, ἣ μέγα ἔργον ἔρεξεν ἀιδρείῃσι νόοιο γημαμένη ᾧ υἷι· ὁ δʼ ὃν πατέρʼ ἐξεναρίξας γῆμεν· ἄφαρ δʼ ἀνάπυστα θεοὶ θέσαν ἀνθρώποισιν. ἀλλʼ ὁ μὲν ἐν Θήβῃ πολυηράτῳ ἄλγεα πάσχων Καδμείων ἤνασσε θεῶν ὀλοὰς διὰ βουλάς· ἡ δʼ ἔβη εἰς Ἀίδαο πυλάρταο κρατεροῖο, ἁψαμένη βρόχον αἰπὺν ἀφʼ ὑψηλοῖο μελάθρου, ᾧ ἄχεϊ σχομένη· τῷ δʼ ἄλγεα κάλλιπʼ ὀπίσσω πολλὰ μάλʼ, ὅσσα τε μητρὸς Ἐρινύες ἐκτελέουσιν.

She was youngest daughter to Amphion son of Iasos and king of Minyan Orkhomenos, and was Queen in Pylos . She bore Nestor, Chromios, and Periklymenos, and she also bore that marvelously lovely woman Pero, who was wooed by all the country round; but Neleus would only give her to him who should raid the cattle of Iphikles from the grazing grounds of Phylake, and this was a hard task. The only man who would undertake to raid them was a certain excellent seer  , but the will of heaven was against him, for the rangers of the cattle caught him and put him in prison; nevertheless when a full year had passed and the same season   came round again, Iphikles set him at liberty, after he had expounded all the oracles of heaven. Thus, then, was the will of Zeus accomplished."	καὶ Χλῶριν εἶδον περικαλλέα, τήν ποτε Νηλεὺς γῆμεν ἑὸν διὰ κάλλος, ἐπεὶ πόρε μυρία ἕδνα, ὁπλοτάτην κούρην Ἀμφίονος Ἰασίδαο, ὅς ποτʼ ἐν Ὀρχομενῷ Μινυείῳ ἶφι ἄνασσεν· ἡ δὲ Πύλου βασίλευε, τέκεν δέ οἱ ἀγλαὰ τέκνα, Νέστορά τε Χρόνιον τε Περικλύμενόν τʼ ἀγέρωχον. τοῖσι δʼ ἐπʼ ἰφθίμην Πηρὼ τέκε, θαῦμα βροτοῖσι, τὴν πάντες μνώοντο περικτίται· οὐδʼ ἄρα Νηλεὺς τῷ ἐδίδου ὃς μὴ ἕλικας βόας εὐρυμετώπους ἐκ Φυλάκης ἐλάσειε βίης Ἰφικληείης ἀργαλέας· τὰς δʼ οἶος ὑπέσχετο μάντις ἀμύμων ἐξελάαν· χαλεπὴ δὲ θεοῦ κατὰ μοῖρα πέδησε, δεσμοί τʼ ἀργαλέοι καὶ βουκόλοι ἀγροιῶται. ἀλλʼ ὅτε δὴ μῆνές τε καὶ ἡμέραι ἐξετελεῦντο ἂψ περιτελλομένου ἔτεος καὶ ἐπήλυθον ὧραι, καὶ τότε δή μιν ἔλυσε βίη Ἰφικληείη, θέσφατα πάντʼ εἰπόντα· Διὸς δʼ ἐτελείετο βουλή.
"""And I saw Leda the wife of Tyndarus, who bore him two famous sons, Castor breaker of horses, and Pollux the mighty boxer.

They were the finest children that were ever born in this world, and the best looking, Orion only excepted; for at nine years old they were nine fathoms high, and measured nine cubits round the chest. They threatened to make war with the gods in Olympus , and tried to set Mount Ossa on the top of Mount Olympus , and Mount Pelion on the top of Ossa, that they might scale heaven itself, and they would have done it too if they had been grown up, but Apollo, son of Leto, killed both of them, before they had got so much as a sign of hair upon their cheeks or chin."	τὴν δὲ μετʼ Ἰφιμέδειαν, Ἀλωῆος παράκοιτιν εἴσιδον, ἣ δὴ φάσκε Ποσειδάωνι μιγῆναι, καί ῥʼ ἔτεκεν δύο παῖδε, μινυνθαδίω δʼ ἐγενέσθην, Ὦτόν τʼ ἀντίθεον τηλεκλειτόν τʼ Ἐφιάλτην, οὓς δὴ μηκίστους θρέψε ζείδωρος ἄρουρα καὶ πολὺ καλλίστους μετά γε κλυτὸν Ὠρίωνα· ἐννέωροι γὰρ τοί γε καὶ ἐννεαπήχεες ἦσαν εὖρος, ἀτὰρ μῆκός γε γενέσθην ἐννεόργυιοι. οἵ ῥα καὶ ἀθανάτοισιν ἀπειλήτην ἐν Ὀλύμπῳ φυλόπιδα στήσειν πολυάικος πολέμοιο.

He asked me to his house, feasted me, and then butchered me most miserably as though I were a fat beast in a slaughter house, while all around me my comrades were slain like sheep or pigs for the wedding breakfast, or dinner-party, or gourmet feast of some great nobleman. You must have seen numbers of men killed either in a general engagement, or in single combat, but you never saw anything so truly pitiable as the way in which we fell in that room, with the mixing-bowl and the loaded tables lying all about, and the ground reeking with our blood. I heard Priam's daughter Cassandra scream as Clytemnestra killed her close beside me. I lay dying upon the earth with the sword in my body, and raised my hands to kill the slut of a murderess, but she slipped away from me; she would not even close my lips nor my eyes when I was dying, for there is nothing in this world so cruel and so shameless as a woman when she has fallen into such guilt as hers was. Fancy murdering her own husband! I thought I was going to be welcomed home by my children and my servants, but her abominable crime has brought disgrace on herself and all women who shall come after - even on the good ones.’"	ὣς ἐφάμην, ὁ δέ μʼ αὐτίκʼ ἀμειβόμενος προσέειπε· διογενὲς Λαερτιάδη, πολυμήχανʼ Ὀδυσσεῦ, οὔτʼ ἐμέ γʼ ἐν νήεσσι Ποσειδάων ἐδάμασσεν ὄρσας ἀργαλέων ἀνέμων ἀμέγαρτον ἀυτμήν, οὔτε μʼ ἀνάρσιοι ἄνδρες ἐδηλήσαντʼ ἐπὶ χέρσου, ἀλλά μοι Αἴγισθος τεύξας θάνατόν τε μόρον τε ἔκτα σὺν οὐλομένῃ ἀλόχῳ, οἶκόνδε καλέσσας, δειπνίσσας, ὥς τίς τε κατέκτανε βοῦν ἐπὶ φάτνῃ. ὣς θάνον οἰκτίστῳ θανάτῳ· περὶ δʼ ἄλλοι ἑταῖροι νωλεμέως κτείνοντο σύες ὣς ἀργιόδοντες, οἵ ῥά τʼ ἐν ἀφνειοῦ ἀνδρὸς μέγα δυναμένοιο ἢ γάμῳ ἢ ἐράνῳ ἢ εἰλαπίνῃ τεθαλυίῃ. ἤδη μὲν πολέων φόνῳ ἀνδρῶν ἀντεβόλησας, μουνὰξ κτεινομένων καὶ ἐνὶ κρατερῇ ὑσμίνῃ· ἀλλά κε κεῖνα μάλιστα ἰδὼν ὀλοφύραο θυμῷ, ὡς ἀμφὶ κρητῆρα τραπέζας τε πληθούσας κείμεθʼ ἐνὶ μεγάρῳ, δάπεδον δʼ ἅπαν αἵματι θῦεν. οἰκτροτάτην δʼ ἤκουσα ὄπα Πριάμοιο θυγατρός, Κασσάνδρης, τὴν κτεῖνε Κλυταιμνήστρη δολόμητις ἀμφʼ ἐμοί, αὐτὰρ ἐγὼ ποτὶ γαίῃ χεῖρας ἀείρων βάλλον ἀποθνήσκων περὶ φασγάνῳ· ἡ δὲ κυνῶπις νοσφίσατʼ, οὐδέ μοι ἔτλη ἰόντι περ εἰς Ἀίδαο χερσὶ κατʼ ὀφθαλμοὺς ἑλέειν σύν τε στόμʼ ἐρεῖσαι. ὣς οὐκ αἰνότερον καὶ κύντερον ἄλλο γυναικός, ἥ τις δὴ τοιαῦτα μετὰ φρεσὶν ἔργα βάληται· οἷον δὴ καὶ κείνη ἐμήσατο ἔργον ἀεικές, κουριδίῳ τεύξασα πόσει φόνον. ἦ τοι ἔφην γε ἀσπάσιος παίδεσσιν ἰδὲ δμώεσσιν ἐμοῖσιν οἴκαδʼ ἐλεύσεσθαι· ἡ δʼ ἔξοχα λυγρὰ ἰδυῖα οἷ τε κατʼ αἶσχος ἔχευε καὶ ἐσσομένῃσιν ὀπίσσω θηλυτέρῃσι γυναιξί, καὶ ἥ κʼ ἐυεργὸς ἔῃσιν.

In our councils of war before Troy he was always first to speak, and his judgment was unerring. Nestor and I were the only two who could surpass him; and when it came to fighting on the plain of Troy , he would never remain with the body of his men, but would dash on far in front, foremost of them all in valor. Many a man did he kill in battle - I cannot name every single one of those whom he slew while fighting on the side of the Argives, but will only say how he killed that valiant hero Eurypylos son of Telephus, who was the handsomest man I ever saw except Memnon; many others also of the Ceteians fell around him by reason of a woman's bribes. Moreover, when all the bravest of the Argives went inside the horse that Epeios had made, and it was left to me to settle when we should either open the door of our ambuscade, or close it, though all the other leaders and chief men among the Danaans were drying their eyes and quaking in every limb, I never once saw him turn pale nor wipe a tear from his cheek; he was all the time urging me to break out from the horse - grasping the handle of his sword and his bronze-shod spear, and breathing fury against the foe. Yet when we had sacked the city of Priam he got his handsome share of the prize wealth and went on board (such is the fortune of war) without a wound upon him, neither from a thrown spear nor in close combat, for the rage of Ares is a matter of great chance.’"	ὣς ἔφατʼ, αὐτὰρ ἐγώ μιν ἀμειβόμενος προσέειπον· ἦ τοι μὲν Πηλῆος ἀμύμονος οὔ τι πέπυσμαι, αὐτάρ τοι παιδός γε Νεοπτολέμοιο φίλοιο πᾶσαν ἀληθείην μυθήσομαι, ὥς με κελεύεις· αὐτὸς γάρ μιν ἐγὼ κοίλης ἐπὶ νηὸς ἐίσης ἤγαγον ἐκ Σκύρου μετʼ ἐυκνήμιδας Ἀχαιούς. ἦ τοι ὅτʼ ἀμφὶ πόλιν Τροίην φραζοίμεθα βουλάς, αἰεὶ πρῶτος ἔβαζε καὶ οὐχ ἡμάρτανε μύθων· Νέστωρ ἀντίθεος καὶ ἐγὼ νικάσκομεν οἴω. αὐτὰρ ὅτʼ ἐν πεδίῳ Τρώων μαρναίμεθα χαλκῷ, οὔ ποτʼ ἐνὶ πληθυῖ μένεν ἀνδρῶν οὐδʼ ἐν ὁμίλῳ, ἀλλὰ πολὺ προθέεσκε τὸ ὃν μένος οὐδενὶ εἴκων, πολλοὺς δʼ ἄνδρας ἔπεφνεν ἐν αἰνῇ δηιοτῆτι. πάντας δʼ οὐκ ἂν ἐγὼ μυθήσομαι οὐδʼ ὀνομήνω, ὅσσον λαὸν ἔπεφνεν ἀμύνων Ἀργείοισιν, ἀλλʼ οἷον τὸν Τηλεφίδην κατενήρατο χαλκῷ, ἥρωʼ Εὐρύπυλον, πολλοὶ δʼ ἀμφʼ αὐτὸν ἑταῖροι Κήτειοι κτείνοντο γυναίων εἵνεκα δώρων. κεῖνον δὴ κάλλιστον ἴδον μετὰ Μέμνονα δῖον. αὐτὰρ ὅτʼ εἰς ἵππον κατεβαίνομεν, ὃν κάμʼ Ἐπειός, Ἀργείων οἱ ἄριστοι, ἐμοὶ δʼ ἐπὶ πάντα τέταλτο, ἠμὲν ἀνακλῖναι πυκινὸν λόχον ἠδʼ ἐπιθεῖναι, ἔνθʼ ἄλλοι Δαναῶν ἡγήτορες ἠδὲ μέδοντες δάκρυά τʼ ὠμόργνυντο τρέμον θʼ ὑπὸ γυῖα ἑκάστου· κεῖνον δʼ οὔ ποτε πάμπαν ἐγὼν ἴδον ὀφθαλμοῖσιν οὔτʼ ὠχρήσαντα χρόα κάλλιμον οὔτε παρειῶν δάκρυ ὀμορξάμενον· ὁ δέ γε μάλα πόλλʼ ἱκέτευεν ἱππόθεν ἐξέμεναι, ξίφεος δʼ ἐπεμαίετο κώπην καὶ δόρυ χαλκοβαρές, κακὰ δὲ Τρώεσσι μενοίνα. ἀλλʼ ὅτε δὴ Πριάμοιο πόλιν διεπέρσαμεν αἰπήν, μοῖραν καὶ γέρας ἐσθλὸν ἔχων ἐπὶ νηὸς ἔβαινεν ἀσκηθής, οὔτʼ ἂρ βεβλημένος ὀξέι χαλκῷ οὔτʼ αὐτοσχεδίην οὐτασμένος, οἷά τε πολλὰ γίγνεται ἐν πολέμῳ· ἐπιμὶξ δέ τε μαίνεται Ἄρης.

There were tall trees, moreover, that shed their fruit over his head - pears, pomegranates, apples, sweet figs and juicy olives, but whenever the poor creature stretched out his hand to take some, the wind tossed the branches back again to the clouds."	καὶ μὴν Τάνταλον εἰσεῖδον κρατέρʼ ἄλγεʼ ἔχοντα ἑστεῶτʼ ἐν λίμνῃ· ἡ δὲ προσέπλαζε γενείῳ· στεῦτο δὲ διψάων, πιέειν δʼ οὐκ εἶχεν ἑλέσθαι· ὁσσάκι γὰρ κύψειʼ ὁ γέρων πιέειν μενεαίνων, τοσσάχʼ ὕδωρ ἀπολέσκετʼ ἀναβροχέν, ἀμφὶ δὲ ποσσὶ γαῖα μέλαινα φάνεσκε, καταζήνασκε δὲ δαίμων. δένδρεα δʼ ὑψιπέτηλα κατὰ κρῆθεν χέε καρπόν, ὄγχναι καὶ ῥοιαὶ καὶ μηλέαι ἀγλαόκαρποι συκέαι τε γλυκεραὶ καὶ ἐλαῖαι τηλεθόωσαι· τῶν ὁπότʼ ἰθύσειʼ ὁ γέρων ἐπὶ χερσὶ μάσασθαι, τὰς δʼ ἄνεμος ῥίπτασκε ποτὶ νέφεα σκιόεντα.

About his breast there was a wondrous golden belt adorned in the most marvelous fashion with bears, wild boars, and lions with gleaming eyes; there was also war, battle, and death. The man who made that belt, do what he might, would never be able to make another like it.

On this I hastened back to my ship and ordered my men to go on board at once and loose the hawsers; so they embarked and took their places, whereon the ship went down the stream of the river Okeanos. We had to row at first, but presently a fair wind sprang up."	ὣς εἰπὼν ὁ μὲν αὖτις ἔβη δόμον Ἄϊδος εἴσω, αὐτὰρ ἐγὼν αὐτοῦ μένον ἔμπεδον, εἴ τις ἔτʼ ἔλθοι ἀνδρῶν ἡρώων, οἳ δὴ τὸ πρόσθεν ὄλοντο. καί νύ κʼ ἔτι προτέρους ἴδον ἀνέρας, οὓς ἔθελόν περ, Θησέα Πειρίθοόν τε, θεῶν ἐρικυδέα τέκνα· ἀλλὰ πρὶν ἐπὶ ἔθνεʼ ἀγείρετο μυρία νεκρῶν ἠχῇ θεσπεσίῃ· ἐμὲ δὲ χλωρὸν δέος ᾕρει, μή μοι Γοργείην κεφαλὴν δεινοῖο πελώρου ἐξ Ἀίδεω πέμψειεν ἀγαυὴ Περσεφόνεια. αὐτίκʼ ἔπειτʼ ἐπὶ νῆα κιὼν ἐκέλευον ἑταίρους αὐτούς τʼ ἀμβαίνειν ἀνά τε πρυμνήσια λῦσαι. οἱ δʼ αἶψʼ εἴσβαινον καὶ ἐπὶ κληῖσι καθῖζον. τὴν δὲ κατʼ Ὠκεανὸν ποταμὸν φέρε κῦμα ῥόοιο,
"""After we were clear of the river Okeanos, and had got out into the open sea, we went on till we reached the Aeaean island where there is dawn and sunrise as in other places. We then drew our ship on to the sands and disembarked onto the shore, where we went to sleep and waited till day should break."	αὐτὰρ ἐπεὶ ποταμοῖο λίπεν ῥόον Ὠκεανοῖο νηῦς, ἀπὸ δʼ ἵκετο κῦμα θαλάσσης εὐρυπόροιο νῆσόν τʼ Αἰαίην, ὅθι τʼ Ἠοῦς ἠριγενείης οἰκία καὶ χοροί εἰσι καὶ ἀντολαὶ Ἠελίοιο, νῆα μὲν ἔνθʼ ἐλθόντες ἐκέλσαμεν ἐν ψαμάθοισιν, ἐκ δὲ καὶ αὐτοὶ βῆμεν ἐπὶ ῥηγμῖνι θαλάσσης· ἔνθα δʼ ἀποβρίξαντες ἐμείναμεν Ἠῶ δῖαν.
"""Then, when the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared, I sent some men to Circe's house to fetch the body of Elpenor. We cut firewood from a wood where the headland jutted out into the sea, and after we had wept over him and lamented him we performed his funeral rites. When his body and armor had been burned to ashes, we raised a cairn, set a stone over it, and at the top of the cairn we fixed the oar that he had been used to row with."	ἦμος δʼ ἠριγένεια φάνη ῥοδοδάκτυλος Ἠώς, δὴ τότʼ ἐγὼν ἑτάρους προΐειν ἐς δώματα Κίρκης οἰσέμεναι νεκρόν, Ἐλπήνορα τεθνηῶτα. φιτροὺς δʼ αἶψα ταμόντες, ὅθʼ ἀκροτάτη πρόεχʼ ἀκτή, θάπτομεν ἀχνύμενοι θαλερὸν κατὰ δάκρυ χέοντες. αὐτὰρ ἐπεὶ νεκρός τʼ ἐκάη καὶ τεύχεα νεκροῦ, τύμβον χεύαντες καὶ ἐπὶ στήλην ἐρύσαντες πήξαμεν ἀκροτάτῳ τύμβῳ ἐυῆρες ἐρετμόν.
"""While we were doing all this, Circe, who knew that we had got back from the house of Hades, dressed herself and came to us as fast as she could; and her maid servants came with her bringing us bread, meat, and wine.

In the meantime I will tell Odysseus about your course, and will explain everything to him so as to prevent your suffering from misadventure either by land or sea.’"	ἡμεῖς μὲν τὰ ἕκαστα διείπομεν· οὐδʼ ἄρα Κίρκην ἐξ Ἀίδεω ἐλθόντες ἐλήθομεν, ἀλλὰ μάλʼ ὦκα ἦλθʼ ἐντυναμένη· ἅμα δʼ ἀμφίπολοι φέρον αὐτῇ σῖτον καὶ κρέα πολλὰ καὶ αἴθοπα οἶνον ἐρυθρόν. ἡ δʼ ἐν μέσσῳ στᾶσα μετηύδα δῖα θεάων· σχέτλιοι, οἳ ζώοντες ὑπήλθετε δῶμʼ Ἀίδαο, δισθανέες, ὅτε τʼ ἄλλοι ἅπαξ θνῄσκουσʼ ἄνθρωποι. ἀλλʼ ἄγετʼ ἐσθίετε βρώμην καὶ πίνετε οἶνον αὖθι πανημέριοι· ἅμα δʼ ἠοῖ φαινομένηφι πλεύσεσθʼ· αὐτὰρ ἐγὼ δείξω ὁδὸν ἠδὲ ἕκαστα σημανέω, ἵνα μή τι κακορραφίῃ ἀλεγεινῇ ἢ ἁλὸς ἢ ἐπὶ γῆς ἀλγήσετε πῆμα παθόντες.
"""We agreed to do as she had said, and feasted through the livelong day to the going down of the sun, but when the sun had set and it came on dark, the men laid themselves down to sleep by the stern cables of the ship. Then Circe took me by the hand and bade me be seated away from the others, while she reclined by my side and asked me all about our adventures."	ὣς ἔφαθʼ, ἡμῖν δʼ αὖτʼ ἐπεπείθετο θυμὸς ἀγήνωρ. ὣς τότε μὲν πρόπαν ἦμαρ ἐς ἠέλιον καταδύντα ἥμεθα δαινύμενοι κρέα τʼ ἄσπετα καὶ μέθυ ἡδύ· ἦμος δʼ ἠέλιος κατέδυ καὶ ἐπὶ κνέφας ἦλθεν, οἱ μὲν κοιμήσαντο παρὰ πρυμνήσια νηός, ἡ δʼ ἐμὲ χειρὸς ἑλοῦσα φίλων ἀπονόσφιν ἑταίρων εἷσέ τε καὶ προσέλεκτο καὶ ἐξερέεινεν ἕκαστα· αὐτὰρ ἐγὼ τῇ πάντα κατὰ μοῖραν κατέλεξα. καὶ τότε δή μʼ ἐπέεσσι προσηύδα πότνια Κίρκη·

First you will come to the Sirens who enchant all who come near them. If any one unwarily draws in too close and hears the singing of the Sirens, his wife and children will never welcome him home again, for they sit in a green field and warble him to death with the sweetness of their song. There is a great heap of dead men's bones lying all around, with the flesh still rotting off them. Therefore pass these Sirens by, and stop your men's ears with wax that none of them may hear; but if you like you can listen yourself, for you may get the men to bind you as you stand upright on a cross-piece half way up the mast, and they must lash the rope's ends to the mast itself, that you may have the pleasure of listening. If you beg and pray the men to unloose you, then they must bind you faster."	ταῦτα μὲν οὕτω πάντα πεπείρανται, σὺ δʼ ἄκουσον, ὥς τοι ἐγὼν ἐρέω, μνήσει δέ σε καὶ θεὸς αὐτός.

"""‘When your crew have taken you past these Sirens, I cannot give you coherent directions as to which of two courses you are to take; I will lay the two alternatives before you, and you must consider them for yourself. On the one hand there are some overhanging rocks against which the seething deep waves of Amphitrite beat with terrific fury; the blessed gods call these rocks the Wanderers. Here not even a bird may pass, no, not even the timid doves that bring ambrosia to Father Zeus, but the sheer rock always carries off one of them, and Father Zeus has to send another to make up their number; no ship that ever yet came to these rocks has got away again, but the waves and whirlwinds of fire are freighted with wreckage and with the bodies of dead men. The only vessel that ever sailed and got through, was the famous Argo on her way from the house of Aietes, and she too would have gone against these great rocks, only that Hera piloted her past them for the love she bore to Jason."	αὐτὰρ ἐπὴν δὴ τάς γε παρὲξ ἐλάσωσιν ἑταῖροι, ἔνθα τοι οὐκέτʼ ἔπειτα διηνεκέως ἀγορεύσω, ὁπποτέρη δή τοι ὁδὸς ἔσσεται, ἀλλὰ καὶ αὐτὸς θυμῷ βουλεύειν· ἐρέω δέ τοι ἀμφοτέρωθεν. ἔνθεν μὲν γὰρ πέτραι ἐπηρεφέες, προτὶ δʼ αὐτὰς κῦμα μέγα ῥοχθεῖ κυανώπιδος Ἀμφιτρίτης· Πλαγκτὰς δή τοι τάς γε θεοὶ μάκαρες καλέουσι. τῇ μέν τʼ οὐδὲ ποτητὰ παρέρχεται οὐδὲ πέλειαι τρήρωνες, ταί τʼ ἀμβροσίην Διὶ πατρὶ φέρουσιν, ἀλλά τε καὶ τῶν αἰὲν ἀφαιρεῖται λὶς πέτρη· ἀλλʼ ἄλλην ἐνίησι πατὴρ ἐναρίθμιον εἶναι. τῇ δʼ οὔ πώ τις νηῦς φύγεν ἀνδρῶν, ἥ τις ἵκηται, ἀλλά θʼ ὁμοῦ πίνακάς τε νεῶν καὶ σώματα φωτῶν κύμαθʼ ἁλὸς φορέουσι πυρός τʼ ὀλοοῖο θύελλαι. οἴη δὴ κείνη γε παρέπλω ποντοπόρος νηῦς, Ἀργὼ πᾶσι μέλουσα, παρʼ Αἰήταο πλέουσα. καὶ νύ κε τὴν ἔνθʼ ὦκα βάλεν μεγάλας ποτὶ πέτρας, ἀλλʼ Ἥρη παρέπεμψεν, ἐπεὶ φίλος ἦεν Ἰήσων.
"""‘Of these two rocks the one reaches heaven and its peak is lost in a dark cloud. This never leaves it, so that the top is never clear not even in summer and early autumn. No man though he had twenty hands and twenty feet could get a foothold on it and climb it, for it runs sheer up, as smooth as though it had been polished. In the middle of it there is a large cavern, looking West and turned towards Erebus; you must take your ship this way, but the cave is so high up that not even the stoutest archer could send an arrow into it. Inside it Scylla sits and yelps with a voice that you might take to be that of a young hound, but in truth she is a dreadful monster and no one - not even a god - could face her without being terror-struck. She has twelve misshapen feet, and six necks of the most prodigious length; and at the end of each neck she has a frightful head with three rows of teeth in each, all set very close together, so that they would crunch any one to death in a moment, and she sits deep within her shady cell thrusting out her heads and peering all round the rock, fishing for dolphins or dogfish or any larger monster that she can catch, of the thousands with which Amphitrite teems. No ship ever yet got past her without losing some men, for she shoots out all her heads at once, and carries off a man in each mouth."	οἱ δὲ δύω σκόπελοι ὁ μὲν οὐρανὸν εὐρὺν ἱκάνει ὀξείῃ κορυφῇ, νεφέλη δέ μιν ἀμφιβέβηκε κυανέη· τὸ μὲν οὔ ποτʼ ἐρωεῖ, οὐδέ ποτʼ αἴθρη κείνου ἔχει κορυφὴν οὔτʼ ἐν θέρει οὔτʼ ἐν ὀπώρῃ. οὐδέ κεν ἀμβαίη βροτὸς ἀνὴρ οὐδʼ ἐπιβαίη, οὐδʼ εἴ οἱ χεῖρές τε ἐείκοσι καὶ πόδες εἶεν· πέτρη γὰρ λίς ἐστι, περιξεστῇ ἐικυῖα. μέσσῳ δʼ ἐν σκοπέλῳ ἔστι σπέος ἠεροειδές, πρὸς ζόφον εἰς Ἔρεβος τετραμμένον, ᾗ περ ἂν ὑμεῖς νῆα παρὰ γλαφυρὴν ἰθύνετε, φαίδιμʼ Ὀδυσσεῦ. οὐδέ κεν ἐκ νηὸς γλαφυρῆς αἰζήιος ἀνὴρ τόξῳ ὀιστεύσας κοῖλον σπέος εἰσαφίκοιτο. ἔνθα δʼ ἐνὶ Σκύλλη ναίει δεινὸν λελακυῖα. τῆς ἦ τοι φωνὴ μὲν ὅση σκύλακος νεογιλῆς γίγνεται, αὐτὴ δʼ αὖτε πέλωρ κακόν· οὐδέ κέ τίς μιν γηθήσειεν ἰδών, οὐδʼ εἰ θεὸς ἀντιάσειεν. τῆς ἦ τοι πόδες εἰσὶ δυώδεκα πάντες ἄωροι, ἓξ δέ τέ οἱ δειραὶ περιμήκεες, ἐν δὲ ἑκάστῃ σμερδαλέη κεφαλή, ἐν δὲ τρίστοιχοι ὀδόντες πυκνοὶ καὶ θαμέες, πλεῖοι μέλανος θανάτοιο. μέσση μέν τε κατὰ σπείους κοίλοιο δέδυκεν, ἔξω δʼ ἐξίσχει κεφαλὰς δεινοῖο βερέθρου, αὐτοῦ δʼ ἰχθυάᾳ, σκόπελον περιμαιμώωσα, δελφῖνάς τε κύνας τε, καὶ εἴ ποθι μεῖζον ἕλῃσι κῆτος, ἃ μυρία βόσκει ἀγάστονος Ἀμφιτρίτη. τῇ δʼ οὔ πώ ποτε ναῦται ἀκήριοι εὐχετόωνται παρφυγέειν σὺν νηί· φέρει δέ τε κρατὶ ἑκάστῳ φῶτʼ ἐξαρπάξασα νεὸς κυανοπρῴροιο.

Presently the great and cunning goddess Circe befriended us with a fair wind that blew dead aft, and stayed steadily with us, keeping our sails well filled, so we did whatever wanted doing to the ship's gear, and let her go as wind and helmsman headed her."	ὣς ἔφατʼ, αὐτίκα δὲ χρυσόθρονος ἤλυθεν Ἠώς. ἡ μὲν ἔπειτʼ ἀνὰ νῆσον ἀπέστιχε δῖα θεάων· αὐτὰρ ἐγὼν ἐπὶ νῆα κιὼν ὤτρυνον ἑταίρους αὐτούς τʼ ἀμβαίνειν ἀνά τε πρυμνήσια λῦσαι· οἱ δʼ αἶψʼ εἴσβαινον καὶ ἐπὶ κληῖσι καθῖζον. ἑξῆς δʼ ἑζόμενοι πολιὴν ἅλα τύπτον ἐρετμοῖς. ἡμῖν δʼ αὖ κατόπισθε νεὸς κυανοπρῴροιο ἴκμενον οὖρον ἵει πλησίστιον, ἐσθλὸν ἑταῖρον, Κίρκη ἐυπλόκαμος, δεινὴ θεὸς αὐδήεσσα. αὐτίκα δʼ ὅπλα ἕκαστα πονησάμενοι κατὰ νῆα ἥμεθα· τὴν δʼ ἄνεμός τε κυβερνήτης τʼ ἴθυνε.

Meanwhile I look a large wheel of wax and cut it up small with my sword. Then I kneaded the wax in my strong hands till it became soft, which it soon did between the kneading and the rays of the sun-god son of Hyperion. Then I stopped the ears of all my men, and they bound me hands and feet to the mast as I stood upright on the crosspiece; but they went on rowing themselves.

"""‘My friends,’ said I, ‘this is not the first time that we have been in danger, and we are in nothing like so bad a case as when the Cyclops shut us up in his cave by forceful violence  ; nevertheless, my courage   and wise counsel   saved us then, and we shall live to look back on all this as well. Now, therefore, let us all do as I say, trust in Zeus and row on with might and main. As for you, coxswain, these are your orders; attend to them, for the ship is in your hands; turn her head away from these steaming rapids and hug the rock, or she will give you the slip and be over yonder before you know where you are, and you will be the death of us.’"	ὦ φίλοι, οὐ γάρ πώ τι κακῶν ἀδαήμονές εἰμεν· οὐ μὲν δὴ τόδε μεῖζον ἕπει κακόν, ἢ ὅτε Κύκλωψ εἴλει ἐνὶ σπῆι γλαφυρῷ κρατερῆφι βίηφιν· ἀλλὰ καὶ ἔνθεν ἐμῇ ἀρετῇ, βουλῇ τε νόῳ τε, ἐκφύγομεν, καί που τῶνδε μνήσεσθαι ὀίω. νῦν δʼ ἄγεθʼ, ὡς ἂν ἐγὼ εἴπω, πειθώμεθα πάντες. ὑμεῖς μὲν κώπῃσιν ἁλὸς ῥηγμῖνα βαθεῖαν τύπτετε κληίδεσσιν ἐφήμενοι, αἴ κέ ποθι Ζεὺς δώῃ τόνδε γʼ ὄλεθρον ὑπεκφυγέειν καὶ ἀλύξαι· σοὶ δέ, κυβερνῆθʼ, ὧδʼ ἐπιτέλλομαι· ἀλλʼ ἐνὶ θυμῷ βάλλευ, ἐπεὶ νηὸς γλαφυρῆς οἰήια νωμᾷς. τούτου μὲν καπνοῦ καὶ κύματος ἐκτὸς ἔεργε νῆα, σὺ δὲ σκοπέλου ἐπιμαίεο, μή σε λάθῃσι κεῖσʼ ἐξορμήσασα καὶ ἐς κακὸν ἄμμε βάλῃσθα.
"""So they did as I told them; but I said nothing about the awful monster Scylla, for I knew the men would not go on rowing if I did, but would huddle together in the hold. In one thing only did I disobey Circe's strict instructions - I put on my armor. Then seizing two strong spears I took my stand on the ship's bows, for it was there that I expected first to see the monster of the rock, who was to do my men so much harm; but I could not make her out anywhere, though I strained my eyes with looking the gloomy rock all over and over."	ὣς ἐφάμην, οἱ δʼ ὦκα ἐμοῖς ἐπέεσσι πίθοντο.

"""Then we entered the Straits in great fear of mind, for on the one hand was Scylla, and on the other dread Charybdis kept sucking up the salt water. As she vomited it up, it was like the water in a cauldron when it is boiling over upon a great fire, and the spray reached the top of the rocks on either side. When she began to suck again, we could see the water all inside whirling round and round, and it made a deafening sound as it broke against the rocks. We could see the bottom of the whirlpool all black with sand and mud, and the men were at their wit's ends for fear. While we were taken up with this, and were expecting each moment to be our last, Scylla pounced down suddenly upon us and violently   snatched up my six best men. I was looking at once after both ship and men, and in a moment I saw their hands and feet ever so high above me, struggling in the air as Scylla was carrying them off, and I heard them call out my name in one last despairing cry. As a fisherman, seated, spear in hand, upon some jutting rock throws bait into the water to deceive the poor little fishes, and spears them with the ox's horn with which his spear is shod, throwing them gasping on to the land as he catches them one by one - even so did Scylla land these panting creatures on her rock and munch them up at the mouth of her den, while they screamed and stretched out their hands to me in their mortal agony. This was the most sickening sight that I saw throughout all my voyages."	ἡμεῖς μὲν στεινωπὸν ἀνεπλέομεν γοόωντες· ἔνθεν μὲν Σκύλλη, ἑτέρωθι δὲ δῖα Χάρυβδις δεινὸν ἀνερροίβδησε θαλάσσης ἁλμυρὸν ὕδωρ. ἦ τοι ὅτʼ ἐξεμέσειε, λέβης ὣς ἐν πυρὶ πολλῷ πᾶσʼ ἀναμορμύρεσκε κυκωμένη, ὑψόσε δʼ ἄχνη ἄκροισι σκοπέλοισιν ἐπʼ ἀμφοτέροισιν ἔπιπτεν· ἀλλʼ ὅτʼ ἀναβρόξειε θαλάσσης ἁλμυρὸν ὕδωρ, πᾶσʼ ἔντοσθε φάνεσκε κυκωμένη, ἀμφὶ δὲ πέτρη δεινὸν ἐβεβρύχει, ὑπένερθε δὲ γαῖα φάνεσκε ψάμμῳ κυανέη· τοὺς δὲ χλωρὸν δέος ᾕρει. ἡμεῖς μὲν πρὸς τὴν ἴδομεν δείσαντες ὄλεθρον· τόφρα δέ μοι Σκύλλη γλαφυρῆς ἐκ νηὸς ἑταίρους ἓξ ἕλεθʼ, οἳ χερσίν τε βίηφί τε φέρτατοι ἦσαν. σκεψάμενος δʼ ἐς νῆα θοὴν ἅμα καὶ μεθʼ ἑταίρους ἤδη τῶν ἐνόησα πόδας καὶ χεῖρας ὕπερθεν ὑψόσʼ ἀειρομένων· ἐμὲ δὲ φθέγγοντο καλεῦντες ἐξονομακλήδην, τότε γʼ ὕστατον, ἀχνύμενοι κῆρ. ὡς δʼ ὅτʼ ἐπὶ προβόλῳ ἁλιεὺς περιμήκεϊ ῥάβδῳ ἰχθύσι τοῖς ὀλίγοισι δόλον κατὰ εἴδατα βάλλων ἐς πόντον προΐησι βοὸς κέρας ἀγραύλοιο, ἀσπαίροντα δʼ ἔπειτα λαβὼν ἔρριψε θύραζε, ὣς οἵ γʼ ἀσπαίροντες ἀείροντο προτὶ πέτρας· αὐτοῦ δʼ εἰνὶ θύρῃσι κατήσθιε κεκληγῶτας χεῖρας ἐμοὶ ὀρέγοντας ἐν αἰνῇ δηιοτῆτι· οἴκτιστον δὴ κεῖνο ἐμοῖς ἴδον ὀφθαλμοῖσι πάντων, ὅσσʼ ἐμόγησα πόρους ἁλὸς ἐξερεείνων.
"""When we had passed the Wandering rocks, with Scylla and terrible Charybdis , we reached the noble island of the sun-god, where were the goodly cattle and sheep belonging to the sun Hyperion. While still at sea in my ship I could bear the cattle lowing as they came home to the yards, and the sheep bleating. Then I remembered what the blind Theban seer   Teiresias had told me, and how carefully Aeaean Circe had warned me to shun the island of the blessed sun-god. So being much troubled I said to the men, ‘My men, I know you are hard pressed, but listen while I tell you the prophecy that Teiresias made me, and how carefully Aeaean Circe warned me to shun the island of the blessed sun-god, for it was here, she said, that our worst danger would lie. Head the ship, therefore, away from the island.’"	αὐτὰρ ἐπεὶ πέτρας φύγομεν δεινήν τε Χάρυβδιν Σκύλλην τʼ, αὐτίκʼ ἔπειτα θεοῦ ἐς ἀμύμονα νῆσον ἱκόμεθʼ· ἔνθα δʼ ἔσαν καλαὶ βόες εὐρυμέτωποι, πολλὰ δὲ ἴφια μῆλʼ Ὑπερίονος Ἠελίοιο. δὴ τότʼ ἐγὼν ἔτι πόντῳ ἐὼν ἐν νηὶ μελαίνῃ μυκηθμοῦ τʼ ἤκουσα βοῶν αὐλιζομενάων οἰῶν τε βληχήν· καί μοι ἔπος ἔμπεσε θυμῷ μάντηος ἀλαοῦ, Θηβαίου Τειρεσίαο, Κίρκης τʼ Αἰαίης, ἥ μοι μάλα πόλλʼ ἐπέτελλε νῆσον ἀλεύασθαι τερψιμβρότου Ἠελίοιο. δὴ τότʼ ἐγὼν ἑτάροισι μετηύδων ἀχνύμενος κῆρ· κέκλυτέ μευ μύθων κακά περ πάσχοντες ἑταῖροι, ὄφρʼ ὑμῖν εἴπω μαντήια Τειρεσίαο Κίρκης τʼ Αἰαίης, ἥ μοι μάλα πόλλʼ ἐπέτελλε νῆσον ἀλεύασθαι τερψιμβρότου Ἠελίοιο· ἔνθα γὰρ αἰνότατον κακὸν ἔμμεναι ἄμμιν ἔφασκεν. ἀλλὰ παρὲξ τὴν νῆσον ἐλαύνετε νῆα μέλαιναν.
"""The men were in despair at this, and Eurylokhos at once gave me an insolent answer. ‘Odysseus,’ said he, ‘you are cruel; you are very strong yourself and never get worn out; you seem to be made of iron, and now, though your men are exhausted with toil and want of sleep, you will not let them land and cook themselves a good supper upon this island, but bid them put out to sea and go faring fruitlessly on through the watches of the fleeing night. It is by night that the winds blow hardest and do so much damage; how can we escape should one of those sudden squalls spring up from South West or West, which so often wreck a vessel when our lords the gods are unpropitious? Now, therefore, let us obey the call of night and prepare our supper here hard by the ship; tomorrow morning we will go on board again and put out to sea.’"	ὣς ἐφάμην, τοῖσιν δὲ κατεκλάσθη φίλον ἦτορ. αὐτίκα δʼ Εὐρύλοχος στυγερῷ μʼ ἠμείβετο μύθῳ· σχέτλιός εἰς, Ὀδυσεῦ· περί τοι μένος, οὐδέ τι γυῖα κάμνεις· ἦ ῥά νυ σοί γε σιδήρεα πάντα τέτυκται, ὅς ῥʼ ἑτάρους καμάτῳ ἁδηκότας ἠδὲ καὶ ὕπνῳ οὐκ ἐάᾳς γαίης ἐπιβήμεναι, ἔνθα κεν αὖτε νήσῳ ἐν ἀμφιρύτῃ λαρὸν τετυκοίμεθα δόρπον, ἀλλʼ αὔτως διὰ νύκτα θοὴν ἀλάλησθαι ἄνωγας νήσου ἀποπλαγχθέντας ἐν ἠεροειδέι πόντῳ. ἐκ νυκτῶν δʼ ἄνεμοι χαλεποί, δηλήματα νηῶν, γίγνονται· πῇ κέν τις ὑπεκφύγοι αἰπὺν ὄλεθρον, ἤν πως ἐξαπίνης ἔλθῃ ἀνέμοιο θύελλα, ἢ Νότου ἢ Ζεφύροιο δυσαέος, οἵ τε μάλιστα νῆα διαρραίουσι θεῶν ἀέκητι ἀνάκτων. ἀλλʼ ἦ τοι νῦν μὲν πειθώμεθα νυκτὶ μελαίνῃ δόρπον θʼ ὁπλισόμεσθα θοῇ παρὰ νηὶ μένοντες, ἠῶθεν δʼ ἀναβάντες ἐνήσομεν εὐρέι πόντῳ.
"""Thus spoke Eurylokhos, and the men approved his words. I saw that a meant us mischief and said, ‘You force me to yield, for you are many against one, but at any rate each one of you must take his solemn oath that if he meet with a herd of cattle or a large flock of sheep, he will not be so mad as to kill a single head of either, but will be satisfied with the food that Circe has given us.’"	ὣς ἔφατʼ Εὐρύλοχος, ἐπὶ δʼ ᾔνεον ἄλλοι ἑταῖροι. καὶ τότε δὴ γίγνωσκον ὃ δὴ κακὰ μήδετο δαίμων, καί μιν φωνήσας ἔπεα πτερόεντα προσηύδων· Εὐρύλοχʼ, ἦ μάλα δή με βιάζετε μοῦνον ἐόντα. ἀλλʼ ἄγε νῦν μοι πάντες ὀμόσσατε καρτερὸν ὅρκον· εἴ κέ τινʼ ἠὲ βοῶν ἀγέλην ἢ πῶυ μέγʼ οἰῶν εὕρωμεν, μή πού τις ἀτασθαλίῃσι κακῇσιν ἢ βοῦν ἠέ τι μῆλον ἀποκτάνῃ· ἀλλὰ ἕκηλοι ἐσθίετε βρώμην, τὴν ἀθανάτη πόρε Κίρκη.
"""They all swore as I bade them, and when they had completed their oath we made the ship fast in a harbor that was near a stream of fresh water, and the men went ashore and cooked their suppers. As soon as they had had enough to eat and drink, they began talking about their poor comrades whom Scylla had snatched up and eaten; this set them weeping and they went on crying till they fell off into a sound sleep."	ὣς ἐφάμην, οἱ δʼ αὐτίκʼ ἀπώμνυον, ὡς ἐκέλευον. αὐτὰρ ἐπεί ῥʼ ὄμοσάν τε τελεύτησάν τε τὸν ὅρκον, στήσαμεν ἐν λιμένι γλαφυρῷ ἐυεργέα νῆα ἄγχʼ ὕδατος γλυκεροῖο, καὶ ἐξαπέβησαν ἑταῖροι νηός, ἔπειτα δὲ δόρπον ἐπισταμένως τετύκοντο. αὐτὰρ ἐπεὶ πόσιος καὶ ἐδητύος ἐξ ἔρον ἕντο, μνησάμενοι δὴ ἔπειτα φίλους ἔκλαιον ἑταίρους, οὓς ἔφαγε Σκύλλη γλαφυρῆς ἐκ νηὸς ἑλοῦσα· κλαιόντεσσι δὲ τοῖσιν ἐπήλυθε νήδυμος ὕπνος.
"""In the third watch of the night when the stars had shifted their places, Zeus raised a great gale of wind that flew a gale so that land and sea were covered with thick clouds, and night sprang forth out of the heavens. When the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared, we brought the ship to land and drew her into a cave wherein the sea-nymphs hold their courts and dances  , and I called the men together in council."	ἦμος δὲ τρίχα νυκτὸς ἔην, μετὰ δʼ ἄστρα βεβήκει, ὦρσεν ἔπι ζαῆν ἄνεμον νεφεληγερέτα Ζεὺς λαίλαπι θεσπεσίῃ, σὺν δὲ νεφέεσσι κάλυψε γαῖαν ὁμοῦ καὶ πόντον· ὀρώρει δʼ οὐρανόθεν νύξ. ἦμος δʼ ἠριγένεια φάνη ῥοδοδάκτυλος Ἠώς, νῆα μὲν ὡρμίσαμεν κοῖλον σπέος εἰσερύσαντες. ἔνθα δʼ ἔσαν νυμφέων καλοὶ χοροὶ ἠδὲ θόωκοι· καὶ τότʼ ἐγὼν ἀγορὴν θέμενος μετὰ μῦθον ἔειπον·
"""‘My friends,’ said I, ‘we have meat and drink in the ship, let us mind, therefore, and not touch the cattle, or we shall suffer for it; for these cattle and sheep belong to the mighty sun, who sees and gives ear to everything. And again they promised that they would obey."	ὦ φίλοι, ἐν γὰρ νηὶ θοῇ βρῶσίς τε πόσις τε ἔστιν, τῶν δὲ βοῶν ἀπεχώμεθα, μή τι πάθωμεν· δεινοῦ γὰρ θεοῦ αἵδε βόες καὶ ἴφια μῆλα, Ἠελίου, ὃς πάντʼ ἐφορᾷ καὶ πάντʼ ἐπακούει. ὣς ἐφάμην, τοῖσιν δʼ ἐπεπείθετο θυμὸς ἀγήνωρ.

As long as grain and wine held out the men did not touch the cattle when they were hungry; when, however, they had eaten all there was in the ship, they were forced to go further afield, with hook and line, catching birds, and taking whatever they could lay their hands on; for they were starving. One day, therefore, I went up inland that I might pray heaven to show me some means of getting away. When I had gone far enough to be clear of all my men, and had found a place that was well sheltered from the wind, I washed my hands and prayed to all the gods in Olympus till by and by they sent me off into a sweet sleep."	μῆνα δὲ πάντʼ ἄλληκτος ἄη Νότος, οὐδέ τις ἄλλος γίγνετʼ ἔπειτʼ ἀνέμων εἰ μὴ Εὖρός τε Νότος τε. οἱ δʼ ἧος μὲν σῖτον ἔχον καὶ οἶνον ἐρυθρόν, τόφρα βοῶν ἀπέχοντο λιλαιόμενοι βιότοιο. ἀλλʼ ὅτε δὴ νηὸς ἐξέφθιτο ἤια πάντα, καὶ δὴ ἄγρην ἐφέπεσκον ἀλητεύοντες ἀνάγκῃ, ἰχθῦς ὄρνιθάς τε, φίλας ὅ τι χεῖρας ἵκοιτο, γναμπτοῖς ἀγκίστροισιν, ἔτειρε δὲ γαστέρα λιμός· δὴ τότʼ ἐγὼν ἀνὰ νῆσον ἀπέστιχον, ὄφρα θεοῖσιν εὐξαίμην, εἴ τίς μοι ὁδὸν φήνειε νέεσθαι. ἀλλʼ ὅτε δὴ διὰ νήσου ἰὼν ἤλυξα ἑταίρους, χεῖρας νιψάμενος, ὅθʼ ἐπὶ σκέπας ἦν ἀνέμοιο, ἠρώμην πάντεσσι θεοῖς οἳ Ὄλυμπον ἔχουσιν· οἱ δʼ ἄρα μοι γλυκὺν ὕπνον ἐπὶ βλεφάροισιν ἔχευαν.
"""Meanwhile Eurylokhos had been giving evil counsel to the men, ‘Listen to me,’ said he, ‘my poor comrades. All deaths are bad enough but there is none so bad as famine. Why should not we drive in the best of these cows and offer them in sacrifice to the immortal gods? If we ever get back to Ithaca , we can build a fine temple to the sun-god and enrich it with every kind of ornament; if, however, he is determined to sink our ship out of revenge for these horned cattle, and the other gods are of the same mind, I for one would rather drink salt water once for all and have done with it, than be starved to death by inches in such a desert island as this is.’"	Εὐρύλοχος δʼ ἑτάροισι κακῆς ἐξήρχετο βουλῆς· κέκλυτέ μευ μύθων κακά περ πάσχοντες ἑταῖροι. πάντες μὲν στυγεροὶ θάνατοι δειλοῖσι βροτοῖσι, λιμῷ δʼ οἴκτιστον θανέειν καὶ πότμον ἐπισπεῖν. ἀλλʼ ἄγετʼ, Ἠελίοιο βοῶν ἐλάσαντες ἀρίστας ῥέξομεν ἀθανάτοισι, τοὶ οὐρανὸν εὐρὺν ἔχουσιν. εἰ δέ κεν εἰς Ἰθάκην ἀφικοίμεθα, πατρίδα γαῖαν, αἶψά κεν Ἠελίῳ Ὑπερίονι πίονα νηὸν τεύξομεν, ἐν δέ κε θεῖμεν ἀγάλματα πολλὰ καὶ ἐσθλά. εἰ δὲ χολωσάμενός τι βοῶν ὀρθοκραιράων νῆʼ ἐθέλῃ ὀλέσαι, ἐπὶ δʼ ἕσπωνται θεοὶ ἄλλοι, βούλομʼ ἅπαξ πρὸς κῦμα χανὼν ἀπὸ θυμὸν ὀλέσσαι, ἢ δηθὰ στρεύγεσθαι ἐὼν ἐν νήσῳ ἐρήμῃ.
"""Thus spoke Eurylokhos, and the men approved his words. Now the cattle, so fair and goodly, were feeding not far from the ship; the men, therefore drove in the best of them, and they all stood round them saying their prayers, and using young oak-shoots instead of barley-meal, for there was no barley left. When they had done praying they killed the cows and dressed their carcasses; they cut out the thigh bones, wrapped them round in two layers of fat, and set some pieces of raw meat on top of them. They had no wine with which to make drink-offerings over the sacrifice while it was cooking, so they kept pouring on a little water from time to time while the inward meats were being grilled; then, when the thigh bones were burned and they had tasted the inward meats, they cut the rest up small and put the pieces upon the spits."	ὣς ἔφατʼ Εὐρύλοχος, ἐπὶ δʼ ᾔνεον ἄλλοι ἑταῖροι. αὐτίκα δʼ Ἠελίοιο βοῶν ἐλάσαντες ἀρίστας ἐγγύθεν, οὐ γὰρ τῆλε νεὸς κυανοπρῴροιο βοσκέσκονθʼ ἕλικες καλαὶ βόες εὐρυμέτωποι· τὰς δὲ περίστησάν τε καὶ εὐχετόωντο θεοῖσιν, φύλλα δρεψάμενοι τέρενα δρυὸς ὑψικόμοιο· οὐ γὰρ ἔχον κρῖ λευκὸν ἐυσσέλμου ἐπὶ νηός. αὐτὰρ ἐπεί ῥʼ εὔξαντο καὶ ἔσφαξαν καὶ ἔδειραν, μηρούς τʼ ἐξέταμον κατά τε κνίσῃ ἐκάλυψαν δίπτυχα ποιήσαντες, ἐπʼ αὐτῶν δʼ ὠμοθέτησαν. οὐδʼ εἶχον μέθυ λεῖψαι ἐπʼ αἰθομένοις ἱεροῖσιν, ἀλλʼ ὕδατι σπένδοντες ἐπώπτων ἔγκατα πάντα. αὐτὰρ ἐπεὶ κατὰ μῆρʼ ἐκάη καὶ σπλάγχνα πάσαντο, μίστυλλόν τʼ ἄρα τἆλλα καὶ ἀμφʼ ὀβελοῖσιν ἔπειραν.

We did not get on much further, for in another moment we were caught by a terrific squall from the West that snapped the forestays of the mast so that it fell aft, while all the ship's gear tumbled about at the bottom of the vessel. The mast fell upon the head of the helmsman in the ship's stern, so that the bones of his head were crushed to pieces, and he fell overboard as though he were diving, with no more life left in him."	ἑξῆμαρ μὲν ἔπειτα ἐμοὶ ἐρίηρες ἑταῖροι δαίνυντʼ Ἠελίοιο βοῶν ἐλάσαντες ἀρίστας· ἀλλʼ ὅτε δὴ ἕβδομον ἦμαρ ἐπὶ Ζεὺς θῆκε Κρονίων, καὶ τότʼ ἔπειτʼ ἄνεμος μὲν ἐπαύσατο λαίλαπι θύων, ἡμεῖς δʼ αἶψʼ ἀναβάντες ἐνήκαμεν εὐρέι πόντῳ, ἱστὸν στησάμενοι ἀνά θʼ ἱστία λεύκʼ ἐρύσαντες. ἀλλʼ ὅτε δὴ τὴν νῆσον ἐλείπομεν, οὐδέ τις ἄλλη φαίνετο γαιάων, ἀλλʼ οὐρανὸς ἠδὲ θάλασσα, δὴ τότε κυανέην νεφέλην ἔστησε Κρονίων νηὸς ὕπερ γλαφυρῆς, ἤχλυσε δὲ πόντος ὑπʼ αὐτῆς. ἡ δʼ ἔθει οὐ μάλα πολλὸν ἐπὶ χρόνον· αἶψα γὰρ ἦλθε κεκληγὼς Ζέφυρος μεγάλῃ σὺν λαίλαπι θύων, ἱστοῦ δὲ προτόνους ἔρρηξʼ ἀνέμοιο θύελλα ἀμφοτέρους· ἱστὸς δʼ ὀπίσω πέσεν, ὅπλα τε πάντα εἰς ἄντλον κατέχυνθʼ. ὁ δʼ ἄρα πρυμνῇ ἐνὶ νηὶ πλῆξε κυβερνήτεω κεφαλήν, σὺν δʼ ὀστέʼ ἄραξε πάντʼ ἄμυδις κεφαλῆς· ὁ δʼ ἄρʼ ἀρνευτῆρι ἐοικὼς κάππεσʼ ἀπʼ ἰκριόφιν, λίπε δʼ ὀστέα θυμὸς ἀγήνωρ.

"""I stuck to the ship till the sea knocked her sides from her keel (which drifted about by itself) and struck the mast out of her in the direction of the keel; but there was a backstay of stout ox-thong still hanging about it, and with this I lashed the mast and keel together, and getting astride of them was carried wherever the winds chose to take me."	αὐτὰρ ἐγὼ διὰ νηὸς ἐφοίτων, ὄφρʼ ἀπὸ τοίχους λῦσε κλύδων τρόπιος, τὴν δὲ ψιλὴν φέρε κῦμα, ἐκ δέ οἱ ἱστὸν ἄραξε ποτὶ τρόπιν. αὐτὰρ ἐπʼ αὐτῷ ἐπίτονος βέβλητο, βοὸς ῥινοῖο τετευχώς· τῷ ῥʼ ἄμφω συνέεργον, ὁμοῦ τρόπιν ἠδὲ καὶ ἱστόν, ἑζόμενος δʼ ἐπὶ τοῖς φερόμην ὀλοοῖς ἀνέμοισιν.
"""The gale from the West had now spent its force, and the wind got into the South again, which frightened me lest I should be taken back to the terrible whirlpool of Charybdis. This indeed was what actually happened, for I was borne along by the waves all night, and by sunrise had reached the rock of Scylla, and the whirlpool. She was then sucking down the salt sea water, but I was carried aloft toward the fig tree, which I caught hold of and clung on to like a bat. I could not plant my feet anywhere so as to stand securely, for the roots were a long way off and the boughs that overshadowed the whole pool were too high, too vast, and too far apart for me to reach them; so I hung patiently on, waiting till the pool should discharge my mast and raft again - and a very long while it seemed. A juryman   is not more glad to get home to supper, after having been long detained in court by troublesome cases, than I was to see my raft beginning to work its way out of the whirlpool again. At last I let go with my hands and feet, and fell heavily into the sea, hard by my raft on to which I then got, and began to row with my hands. As for Scylla, the father of gods and men would not let her get further sight of me - otherwise I should have certainly been lost."	ἔνθʼ ἦ τοι Ζέφυρος μὲν ἐπαύσατο λαίλαπι θύων, ἦλθε δʼ ἐπὶ Νότος ὦκα, φέρων ἐμῷ ἄλγεα θυμῷ, ὄφρʼ ἔτι τὴν ὀλοὴν ἀναμετρήσαιμι Χάρυβδιν. παννύχιος φερόμην, ἅμα δʼ ἠελίῳ ἀνιόντι ἦλθον ἐπὶ Σκύλλης σκόπελον δεινήν τε Χάρυβδιν. ἡ μὲν ἀνερροίβδησε θαλάσσης ἁλμυρὸν ὕδωρ· αὐτὰρ ἐγὼ ποτὶ μακρὸν ἐρινεὸν ὑψόσʼ ἀερθείς, τῷ προσφὺς ἐχόμην ὡς νυκτερίς. οὐδέ πῃ εἶχον οὔτε στηρίξαι ποσὶν ἔμπεδον οὔτʼ ἐπιβῆναι· ῥίζαι γὰρ ἑκὰς εἶχον, ἀπήωροι δʼ ἔσαν ὄζοι, μακροί τε μεγάλοι τε, κατεσκίαον δὲ Χάρυβδιν. νωλεμέως δʼ ἐχόμην, ὄφρʼ ἐξεμέσειεν ὀπίσσω ἱστὸν καὶ τρόπιν αὖτις· ἐελδομένῳ δέ μοι ἦλθον ὄψʼ· ἦμος δʼ ἐπὶ δόρπον ἀνὴρ ἀγορῆθεν ἀνέστη κρίνων νείκεα πολλὰ δικαζομένων αἰζηῶν, τῆμος δὴ τά γε δοῦρα Χαρύβδιος ἐξεφαάνθη. ἧκα δʼ ἐγὼ καθύπερθε πόδας καὶ χεῖρε φέρεσθαι, μέσσῳ δʼ ἐνδούπησα παρὲξ περιμήκεα δοῦρα, ἑζόμενος δʼ ἐπὶ τοῖσι διήρεσα χερσὶν ἐμῇσι.

"""Hence I was carried along for nine days till on the tenth night the gods stranded me on the Ogygian island, where dwells the great and powerful goddess Calypso. She took me in and was kind to me, but I need say no more about this, for I told you and your noble wife all about it yesterday, and it is hateful   for me to say the same thing over and over again."""	ἔνθεν δʼ ἐννῆμαρ φερόμην, δεκάτῃ δέ με νυκτὶ νῆσον ἐς Ὠγυγίην πέλασαν θεοί, ἔνθα Καλυψὼ ναίει ἐυπλόκαμος, δεινὴ θεὸς αὐδήεσσα, ἥ μʼ ἐφίλει τʼ ἐκόμει τε. τί τοι τάδε μυθολογεύω; ἤδη γάρ τοι χθιζὸς ἐμυθεόμην ἐνὶ οἴκῳ σοί τε καὶ ἰφθίμῃ ἀλόχῳ· ἐχθρὸν δέ μοί ἐστιν
Thus did he speak, and they all held their peace throughout the covered room, enthralled by the charm of his story, till presently Alkinoos began to speak.	ὣς ἔφαθʼ, οἱ δʼ ἄρα πάντες ἀκὴν ἐγένοντο σιωπῇ, κηληθμῷ δʼ ἔσχοντο κατὰ μέγαρα σκιόεντα.
"""Odysseus,"" said he, ""now that you have reached my house I doubt not you will get home without further misadventure no matter how much you have suffered in the past. To you others, however, who come here night after night to drink my choicest wine and listen to my bard, I would insist as follows. Our guest has already packed up the clothes, wrought gold, and other valuables which you have brought for his acceptance; let us now, therefore, present him further, each one of us, with a large tripod and a cauldron. We will recoup ourselves by the levy of a general rate throughout the ; for private individuals cannot be expected to bear the burden of such a handsome present."""	τὸν δʼ αὖτʼ Ἀλκίνοος ἀπαμείβετο φώνησέν τε· ὦ Ὀδυσεῦ, ἐπεὶ ἵκευ ἐμὸν ποτὶ χαλκοβατὲς δῶ, ὑψερεφές, τῷ σʼ οὔ τι παλιμπλαγχθέντα γʼ ὀΐω ἂψ ἀπονοστήσειν, εἰ καὶ μάλα πολλὰ πέπονθας. ὑμέων δʼ ἀνδρὶ ἑκάστῳ ἐφιέμενος τάδε εἴρω, ὅσσοι ἐνὶ μεγάροισι γερούσιον αἴθοπα οἶνον αἰεὶ πίνετʼ ἐμοῖσιν, ἀκουάζεσθε δʼ ἀοιδοῦ. εἵματα μὲν δὴ ξείνῳ ἐϋξέστῃ ἐνὶ χηλῷ κεῖται καὶ χρυσὸς πολυδαίδαλος ἄλλα τε πάντα δῶρʼ, ὅσα Φαιήκων βουληφόροι ἐνθάδʼ ἔνεικαν· ἀλλʼ ἄγε οἱ δῶμεν τρίποδα μέγαν ἠδὲ λέβητα ἀνδρακάς· ἡμεῖς δʼ αὖτε ἀγειρόμενοι κατὰ δῆμον τισόμεθʼ· ἀργαλέον γὰρ ἕνα προικὸς χαρίσασθαι.
Every one approved of this, and then they went home to bed each in his own abode. When the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared, they hurried down to the ship and brought their cauldrons with them. Alkinoos went on board and saw everything so securely stowed under the ship's benches that nothing could break adrift and injure the rowers. Then they went to the house of Alkinoos to get dinner, and he sacrificed a bull for them in honor of Zeus who is the lord of all. They set the meats to grill and made an excellent dinner, after which the inspired bard, Demodokos, who was a favorite with every one, sang to them; but Odysseus kept on turning his eyes towards the sun, as though to hasten his setting, for he was longing to be on his way. As one who has been all day ploughing a fallow field with a couple of oxen keeps thinking about his supper and is glad when night comes that he may go and get it, for it is all his legs can do to carry him, even so did Odysseus rejoice when the sun went down, and he at once said to the Phaeacians, addressing himself more particularly to King Alkinoos:	ὣς ἔφατʼ Ἀλκίνοος, τοῖσιν δʼ ἐπιὴνδανε μῦθος. οἱ μὲν κακκείοντες ἔβαν οἶκόνδε ἕκαστος, ἦμος δʼ ἠριγένεια φάνη ῥοδοδάκτυλος Ἠώς, νῆάδʼ ἐπεσσεύοντο, φέρον δʼ εὐήνορα χαλκόν. καὶ τὰ μὲν εὖ κατέθηχʼ ἱερὸν μένος Ἀλκινόοιο, αὐτὸς ἰὼν διὰ νηὸς ὑπὸ ζυγά, μή τινʼ ἑταίρων βλάπτοι ἐλαυνόντων, ὁπότε σπερχοίατʼ ἐρετμοῖς. οἱ δʼ εἰς Ἀλκινόοιο κίον καὶ δαῖτʼ ἀλέγυνον. τοῖσι δὲ βοῦν ἱέρευσʼ ἱερὸν μένος Ἀλκινόοιο Ζηνὶ κελαινεφέϊ Κρονίδῃ, ὃς πᾶσιν ἀνάσσει. μῆρα δὲ κήαντες δαίνυντʼ ἐρικυδέα δαῖτα τερπόμενοι· μετὰ δέ σφιν ἐμέλπετο θεῖος ἀοιδός, Δημόδοκος, λαοῖσι τετιμένος. αὐτὰρ Ὀδυσσεὺς πολλὰ πρὸς ἠέλιον κεφαλὴν τρέπε παμφανόωντα, δῦναι ἐπειγόμενος· δὴ γὰρ μενέαινε νέεσθαι. ὡς δʼ ὅτʼ ἀνὴρ δόρποιο λιλαίεται, ᾧ τε πανῆμαρ νειὸν ἀνʼ ἕλκητον βόε οἴνοπε πηκτὸν ἄροτρον· ἀσπασίως δʼ ἄρα τῷ κατέδυ φάος ἠελίοιο δόρπον ἐποίχεσθαι, βλάβεται δέ τε γούνατʼ ἰόντι· ὣς Ὀδυσῆʼ ἀσπαστὸν ἔδυ φάος ἠελίοιο. αἶψα δὲ Φαιήκεσσι φιληρέτμοισι μετηύδα, Ἀλκινόῳ δὲ μάλιστα πιφαυσκόμενος φάτο μῦθον·
"""Sir, and all of you, farewell. Make your drink-offerings and send me on my way rejoicing, for you have fulfilled my heart's desire by giving me an escort, and making me presents, which heaven grant that I may turn to good account  ; may I find my admirable wife living in peace among friends, and may you whom I leave behind me give satisfaction to your wives and children; may heaven grant you every good grace  , and may no evil thing come among your people."""	Ἀλκίνοε κρεῖον, πάντων ἀριδείκετε λαῶν, πέμπετέ με σπείσαντες ἀπήμονα, χαίρετε δʼ αὐτοί· ἤδη γὰρ τετέλεσται ἅ μοι φίλος ἤθελε θυμός, πομπὴ καὶ φίλα δῶρα, τά μοι θεοὶ Οὐρανίωνες ὄλβια ποιήσειαν· ἀμύμονα δʼ οἴκοι ἄκοιτιν νοστήσας εὕροιμι σὺν ἀρτεμέεσσι φίλοισιν. ὑμεῖς δʼ αὖθι μένοντες ἐϋφραίνοιτε γυναῖκας κουριδίας καὶ τέκνα· θεοὶ δʼ ἀρετὴν ὀπάσειαν παντοίην, καὶ μή τι κακὸν μεταδήμιον εἴη.
"Thus did he speak. His hearers all of them approved his saying and agreed that he should have his escort inasmuch as he had spoken reasonably. Alkinoos therefore said to his servant, ""Pontonoos, mix some wine and hand it round to everybody, that we may offer a prayer to father Zeus, and speed our guest upon his way."""	ὣς ἔφαθʼ, οἱ δʼ ἄρα πάντες ἐπῄνεον ἠδʼ ἐκέλευον πεμπέμεναι τὸν ξεῖνον, ἐπεὶ κατὰ μοῖραν ἔειπεν. καὶ τότε κήρυκα προσέφη μένος Ἀλκινόοιο· Ποντόνοε, κρητῆρα κερασσάμενος μέθυ νεῖμον πᾶσιν ἀνὰ μέγαρον, ὄφρʼ εὐξάμενοι Διὶ πατρὶ τὸν ξεῖνον πέμπωμεν ἑὴν ἐς πατρίδα γαῖαν.
Pontonoos mixed the wine and handed it to every one in turn; the others each from his own seat made a drink-offering to the blessed gods that live in heaven, but Odysseus rose and placed the double cup in the hands of queen Arete.	ὣς φάτο, Ποντόνοος δὲ μελίφρονα οἶνον ἐκίρνα, νώμησεν δʼ ἄρα πᾶσιν ἐπισταδόν· οἱ δὲ θεοῖσιν ἔσπεισαν μακάρεσσι, τοὶ οὐρανὸν εὐρὺν ἔχουσιν, αὐτόθεν ἐξ ἑδρέων. ἀνὰ δʼ ἵστατο δῖος Ὀδυσσεύς, Ἀρήτῃ δʼ ἐν χειρὶ τίθει δέπας ἀμφικύπελλον, καί μιν φωνήσας ἔπεα πτερόεντα προσηύδα·
"""Farewell, queen,"" said he, ""henceforward and for ever, till age and death, the common lot of humankind, lay their hands upon you. I now take my leave; be happy in this house with your children, your people, and with king Alkinoos."""	χαῖρέ μοι, ὦ βασίλεια, διαμπερές, εἰς ὅ κε γῆρας ἔλθῃ καὶ θάνατος, τά τʼ ἐπʼ ἀνθρώποισι πέλονται. αὐτὰρ ἐγὼ νέομαι· σὺ δὲ τέρπεο τῷδʼ ἐνὶ οἴκῳ παισί τε καὶ λαοῖσι καὶ Ἀλκινόῳ βασιλῆϊ.
As he spoke he crossed the threshold, and Alkinoos sent a man to conduct him to his ship and to the sea shore. Arete also sent some maid servants with him - one with a clean shirt and cloak, another to carry his strong-box, and a third with grain and wine. When they got to the water side the crew took these things and put them on board, with all the meat and drink; but for Odysseus they spread a rug and a linen sheet on deck that he might sleep soundly in the stern of the ship. Then he too went on board and lay down without a word, but the crew took every man his place in order   and loosed the hawser from the pierced stone to which it had been bound. Thereon, when they began rowing out to sea, Odysseus fell into a deep, sweet, and almost deathlike slumber.	ὣς εἰπὼν ὑπὲρ οὐδὸν ἐβήσετο δῖος Ὀδυσσεύς, τῷ δʼ ἅμα κήρυκα προΐει μένος Ἀλκινόοιο, ἡγεῖσθαι ἐπὶ νῆα θοὴν καὶ θῖνα θαλάσσης· Ἀρήτη δʼ ἄρα οἱ δμῳὰς ἅμʼ ἔπεμπε γυναῖκας, τὴν μὲν φᾶρος ἔχουσαν ἐϋπλυνὲς ἠδὲ χιτῶνα, τὴν δʼ ἑτέρην χηλὸν πυκινὴν ἅμʼ ὄπασσε κομίζειν· ἡ δʼ ἄλλη σῖτόν τʼ ἔφερεν καὶ οἶνον ἐρυθρόν. αὐτὰρ ἐπεί ῥʼ ἐπὶ νῆα κατήλυθον ἠδὲ θάλασσαν, αἶψα τά γʼ ἐν νηῒ γλαφυρῇ πομπῆες ἀγαυοὶ δεξάμενοι κατέθεντο, πόσιν καὶ βρῶσιν ἅπασαν· κὰδ δʼ ἄρʼ Ὀδυσσῆϊ στόρεσαν ῥῆγός τε λίνον τε νηὸς ἐπʼ ἰκριόφιν γλαφυρῆς, ἵνα νήγρετον εὕδοι, πρυμνῆς· ἂν δὲ καὶ αὐτὸς ἐβήσετο καὶ κατέλεκτο σιγῇ· τοὶ δὲ καθῖζον ἐπὶ κληῗσιν ἕκαστοι κόσμῳ, πεῖσμα δʼ ἔλυσαν ἀπὸ τρητοῖο λίθοιο. εὖθʼ οἱ ἀνακλινθέντες ἀνερρίπτουν ἅλα πηδῷ, καὶ τῷ νήδυμος ὕπνος ἐπὶ βλεφάροισιν ἔπιπτε, νήγρετος, ἥδιστος, θανάτῳ ἄγχιστα ἐοικώς.
The ship bounded forward on her way as a four in hand chariot flies over the course when the horses feel the whip. Her prow curved as it were the neck of a stallion, and a great wave of dark seething water boiled in her wake. She held steadily on her course, and even a falcon, swiftest of all birds, could not have kept pace with her. Thus, then, she cut her way through the water. carrying one who was as cunning as the gods, but who was now sleeping peacefully, forgetful of all that he had suffered both on the field of battle and by the waves of the weary sea.	ἡ δʼ, ὥς τʼ ἐν πεδίῳ τετράοροι ἄρσενες ἵπποι, πάντες ἅμʼ ὁρμηθέντες ὑπὸ πληγῇσιν ἱμάσθλης, ὑψόσʼ ἀειρόμενοι ῥίμφα πρήσσουσι κέλευθον, ὣς ἄρα τῆς πρύμνη μὲν ἀείρετο, κῦμα δʼ ὄπισθε πορφύρεον μέγα θῦε πολυφλοίσβοιο θαλάσσης. ἡ δὲ μάλʼ ἀσφαλέως θέεν ἔμπεδον· οὐδέ κεν ἴρηξ κίρκος ὁμαρτήσειεν, ἐλαφρότατος πετεηνῶν. ὣς ἡ ῥίμφα θέουσα θαλάσσης κύματʼ ἔταμνεν, ἄνδρα φέρουσα θεοῖς ἐναλίγκια μήδεʼ ἔχοντα· ὃς πρὶν μὲν μάλα πολλὰ πάθʼ ἄλγεα ὃν κατὰ θυμὸν ἀνδρῶν τε πτολέμους ἀλεγεινά τε κύματα πείρων, δὴ τότε γʼ ἀτρέμας εὗδε, λελασμένος ὅσσʼ ἐπεπόνθει.
When the bright star that heralds the approach of dawn began to show. the ship drew near to land. Now there is in the of Ithaca a haven of the Old One of the Sea, Phorkys, which lies between two points that break the line of the sea and shut the harbor in. These shelter it from the storms of wind and sea that rage outside, so that, when once within it, a ship may lie without being even moored. At the head of this harbor there is a large olive tree, and at no distance a fine overarching cavern sacred to the nymphs who are called Naiads. There are mixing-bowls within it and wine-jars of stone, and the bees hive there. Moreover, there are great looms of stone on which the nymphs weave their robes of sea purple - very curious to see - and at all times there is water within it. It has two entrances, one facing North by which mortals can go down into the cave, while the other comes from the South and is more mysterious; mortals cannot possibly get in by it, it is the way taken by the gods.	εὖτʼ ἀστὴρ ὑπερέσχε φαάντατος, ὅς τε μάλιστα ἔρχεται ἀγγέλλων φάος Ἠοῦς ἠριγενείης, τῆμος δὴ νήσῳ προσεπίλνατο ποντοπόρος νηῦς. Φόρκυνος δέ τίς ἐστι λιμήν, ἁλίοιο γέροντος, ἐν δήμῳ Ἰθάκης· δύο δὲ προβλῆτες ἐν αὐτῷ ἀκταὶ ἀπορρῶγες, λιμένος ποτιπεπτηυῖαι, αἵ τʼ ἀνέμων σκεπόωσι δυσαήων μέγα κῦμα ἔκτοθεν· ἔντοσθεν δέ τʼ ἄνευ δεσμοῖο μένουσι νῆες ἐΰσσελμοι, ὅτʼ ἂν ὅρμου μέτρον ἵκωνται. αὐτὰρ ἐπὶ κρατὸς λιμένος τανύφυλλος ἐλαίη, ἀγχόθι δʼ αὐτῆς ἄντρον ἐπήρατον ἠεροειδές, ἱρὸν νυμφάων αἱ νηϊάδες καλέονται. ἐν δὲ κρητῆρές τε καὶ ἀμφιφορῆες ἔασιν λάϊνοι· ἔνθα δʼ ἔπειτα τιθαιβώσσουσι μέλισσαι. ἐν δʼ ἱστοὶ λίθεοι περιμήκεες, ἔνθα τε νύμφαι φάρεʼ ὑφαίνουσιν ἁλιπόρφυρα, θαῦμα ἰδέσθαι· ἐν δʼ ὕδατʼ ἀενάοντα. δύω δέ τέ οἱ θύραι εἰσίν, αἱ μὲν πρὸς Βορέαο καταιβαταὶ ἀνθρώποισιν, αἱ δʼ αὖ πρὸς Νότου εἰσὶ θεώτεραι· οὐδέ τι κείνῃ ἄνδρες ἐσέρχονται, ἀλλʼ ἀθανάτων ὁδός ἐστιν.
Into this harbor, then, they took their ship, for they knew the place, She had so much way upon her that she ran half her own length on to the shore; when, however, they had landed, the first thing they did was to lift Odysseus with his rug and linen sheet out of the ship, and lay him down upon the sand still fast asleep. Then they took out the presents which Athena had persuaded the Phaeacians to give him when he was setting out on his voyage homewards. They put these all together by the root of the olive tree, away from the road, for fear some passer by might come and steal them before Odysseus awoke; and then they made the best of their way home again.	ἔνθʼ οἵ γʼ εἰσέλασαν, πρὶν εἰδότες· ἡ μὲν ἔπειτα ἠπείρῳ ἐπέκελσεν, ὅσον τʼ ἐπὶ ἥμισυ πάσης, σπερχομένη· τοῖον γὰρ ἐπείγετο χέρσʼ ἐρετάων· οἱ δʼ ἐκ νηὸς βάντες ἐϋζύγου ἤπειρόνδε πρῶτον Ὀδυσσῆα γλαφυρῆς ἐκ νηὸς ἄειραν αὐτῷ σύν τε λίνῳ καὶ ῥήγεϊ σιγαλόεντι, κὰδ δʼ ἄρʼ ἐπὶ ψαμάθῳ ἔθεσαν δεδμημένον ὕπνῳ, ἐκ δὲ κτήματʼ ἄειραν, ἅ οἱ Φαίηκες ἀγαυοὶ ὤπασαν οἴκαδʼ ἰόντι διὰ μεγάθυμον Ἀθήνην. καὶ τὰ μὲν οὖν παρὰ πυθμένʼ ἐλαίης ἀθρόα θῆκαν ἐκτὸς ὁδοῦ, μή πώς τις ὁδιτάων ἀνθρώπων, πρίν γʼ Ὀδυσῆʼ ἔγρεσθαι, ἐπελθὼν δηλήσαιτο·
"But Poseidon did not forget the threats with which he had already threatened Odysseus, so he took counsel with Zeus. ""Father Zeus,"" said he, ""I shall no longer be held in any sort of respect among you gods, if mortals like the Phaeacians, who are my own flesh and blood, show such small regard for me. I said I would get Odysseus home when he had suffered sufficiently. I did not say that he should never have a homecoming   at all, for I knew you had already nodded your head about it, and promised that he should do so; but now they have brought him over the sea in a ship fast asleep and have landed him in Ithaca after loading him with more magnificent presents of bronze, gold, and raiment than he would ever have brought back from Troy , if he had had his share of the spoil and got home without misadventure."""	αὐτοὶ δʼ αὖτʼ οἶκόνδε πάλιν κίον. οὐδʼ ἐνοσίχθων λήθετʼ ἀπειλάων, τὰς ἀντιθέῳ Ὀδυσῆϊ πρῶτον ἐπηπείλησε, Διὸς δʼ ἐξείρετο βουλήν· Ζεῦ πάτερ, οὐκέτʼ ἐγώ γε μετʼ ἀθανάτοισι θεοῖσι τιμήεις ἔσομαι, ὅτε με βροτοὶ οὔ τι τίουσιν, Φαίηκες, τοί πέρ τοι ἐμῆς ἔξ εἰσι γενέθλης. καὶ γὰρ νῦν Ὀδυσῆʼ ἐφάμην κακὰ πολλὰ παθόντα οἴκαδʼ ἐλεύσεσθαι· νόστον δέ οἱ οὔ ποτʼ ἀπηύρων πάγχυ, ἐπεὶ σὺ πρῶτον ὑπέσχεο καὶ κατένευσας. οἱ δʼ εὕδοντʼ ἐν νηῒ θοῇ ἐπὶ πόντον ἄγοντες κάτθεσαν εἰν Ἰθάκῃ, ἔδοσαν δέ οἱ ἄσπετα δῶρα, χαλκόν τε χρυσόν τε ἅλις ἐσθῆτά θʼ ὑφαντήν, πόλλʼ, ὅσʼ ἂν οὐδέ ποτε Τροίης ἐξήρατʼ Ὀδυσσεύς, εἴ περ ἀπήμων ἦλθε, λαχὼν ἀπὸ ληΐδος αἶσαν.
"And Zeus answered, ""What, O Lord of the Earthquake, are you talking about? The gods are by no means wanting in respect for you. It would be monstrous were they to insult one so old and honored as you are. As regards mortals, however, if any of them is indulging in insolence   and treating you disrespectfully, it will always rest with yourself to deal with him as you may think proper, so do just as you please."""	τὸν δʼ ἀπαμειβόμενος προσέφη νεφεληγερέτα Ζεὺς· ὢ πόποι, ἐννοσίγαιʼ εὐρυσθενές, οἷον ἔειπες. οὔ τί σʼ ἀτιμάζουσι θεοί· χαλεπὸν δέ κεν εἴη πρεσβύτατον καὶ ἄριστον ἀτιμίῃσιν ἰάλλειν. ἀνδρῶν δʼ εἴ πέρ τίς σε βίῃ καὶ κάρτεϊ εἴκων οὔ τι τίει. σοὶ δʼ ἐστὶ καὶ ἐξοπίσω τίσις αἰεί. ἔρξον ὅπως ἐθέλεις καί τοι φίλον ἔπλετο θυμῷ.
"""I should have done so at once,"" replied Poseidon, ""if I were not anxious to avoid anything that might displease you; now, therefore, I should like to wreck the Phaeacian ship as it is returning from its escort. This will stop them from escorting people in future; and I should also like to envelop their city under a huge mountain."""	τὸν δʼ ἠμείβετʼ ἔπειτα Ποσειδάων ἐνοσίχθων· αἶψά κʼ ἐγὼν ἔρξαιμι, κελαινεφές, ὡς ἀγορεύεις· ἀλλὰ σὸν αἰεὶ θυμὸν ὀπίζομαι ἠδʼ ἀλεείνω. νῦν αὖ Φαιήκων ἐθέλω περικαλλέα νῆα, ἐκ πομπῆς ἀνιοῦσαν, ἐν ἠεροειδέϊ πόντῳ ῥαῖσαι, ἵνʼ ἤδη σχῶνται, ἀπολλήξωσι δὲ πομπῆς ἀνθρώπων, μέγα δέ σφιν ὄρος πόλει ἀμφικαλύψαι.
"""My good friend,"" answered Zeus, ""I should recommend you at the very moment when the people from the city are watching the ship on her way, to turn it into a rock near the land and looking like a ship. This will astonish everybody, and you can then envelop their city under the mountain."""	τὸν δʼ ἀπαμειβόμενος προσέφη νεφεληγερέτα Ζεύς· ὢ πέπον, ὡς μὲν ἐμῷ θυμῷ δοκεῖ εἶναι ἄριστα, ὁππότε κεν δὴ πάντες ἐλαυνομένην προΐδωνται λαοὶ ἀπὸ πτόλιος, θεῖναι λίθον ἐγγύθι γαίης νηῒ θοῇ ἴκελον, ἵνα θαυμάζωσιν ἅπαντες ἄνθρωποι, μέγα δέ σφιν ὄρος πόλει ἀμφικαλύψαι.
When earth-encircling Poseidon heard this he went to Scheria where the Phaeacians live, and stayed there till the ship, which was making rapid way, had got close-in. Then he went up to it, turned it into stone, and drove it down with the flat of his hand so as to root it in the ground. After this he went away.	αὐτὰρ ἐπεὶ τό γʼ ἄκουσε Ποσειδάων ἐνοσίχθων, βῆ ῥʼ ἴμεν ἐς Σχερίην, ὅθι Φαίηκες γεγάασιν. ἔνθʼ ἔμενʼ· ἡ δὲ μάλα σχεδὸν ἤλυθε ποντοπόρος νηῦς ῥίμφα διωκομένη· τῆς δὲ σχεδὸν ἦλθʼ ἐνοσίχθων, ὅς μιν λᾶαν ἔθηκε καὶ ἐρρίζωσεν ἔνερθε χειρὶ καταπρηνεῖ ἐλάσας· ὁ δὲ νόσφι βεβήκει.
"The Phaeacians then began talking among themselves, and one would turn towards his neighbor, saying, ""Who is it that can have rooted the ship in the sea just as she was getting into port? We could see the whole of her only a moment ago."""	οἱ δὲ πρὸς ἀλλήλους ἔπεα πτερόεντʼ ἀγόρευον Φαίηκες δολιχήρετμοι, ναυσίκλυτοι ἄνδρες. ὧδε δέ τις εἴπεσκεν ἰδὼν ἐς πλησίον ἄλλον· ὤ μοι, τίς δὴ νῆα θοὴν ἐπέδησʼ ἐνὶ πόντῳ οἴκαδʼ ἐλαυνομένην; καὶ δὴ προὐφαίνετο πᾶσα.
"This was how they talked, but they knew nothing about it; and Alkinoos said, ""I remember now the old prophecy of my father. He said that Poseidon would be angry with us for taking every one so safely over the sea, and would one day wreck a Phaeacian ship as it was returning from an escort, and envelop our city with a high mountain. This was what my old father used to say, and now it is all coming true. Now therefore let us all do as I say; in the first place we must leave off giving people escorts when they come here, and in the next let us sacrifice twelve picked   bulls to Poseidon that he may have mercy upon us, and not envelop our city with the high mountain."" When the people heard this they were afraid and got ready the bulls."	ὣς ἄρα τις εἴπεσκε· τὰ δʼ οὐκ ἴσαν ὡς ἐτέτυκτο. τοῖσιν δʼ Ἀλκίνοος ἀγορήσατο καὶ μετέειπεν· ὢ πόποι, ἦ μάλα δή με παλαίφατα θέσφαθʼ ἱκάνει πατρὸς ἐμοῦ, ὃς ἔφασκε Ποσειδάωνʼ ἀγάσασθαι ἡμῖν, οὕνεκα πομποὶ ἀπήμονές εἰμεν ἁπάντων. φῆ ποτὲ Φαιήκων ἀνδρῶν περικαλλέα, νῆα, ἐκ πομπῆς ἀνιοῦσαν, ἐν ἠεροειδέϊ πόντῳ ῥαισέμεναι, μέγα δʼ ἧμιν ὄρος πόλει ἀμφικαλύψειν. ὣς ἀγόρευʼ ὁ γέρων· τὰ δὲ δὴ νῦν πάντα τελεῖται. ἀλλʼ ἄγεθʼ, ὡς ἂν ἐγὼ εἴπω, πειθώμεθα πάντες· πομπῆς μὲν παύσασθε βροτῶν, ὅτε κέν τις ἵκηται ἡμέτερον προτὶ ἄστυ· Ποσειδάωνι δὲ ταύρους δώδεκα κεκριμένους ἱερεύσομεν, αἴ κʼ ἐλεήσῃ, μηδʼ ἡμῖν περίμηκες ὄρος πόλει ἀμφικαλύψῃ. ὣς ἔφαθʼ, οἱ δʼ ἔδεισαν, ἑτοιμάσσαντο δὲ ταύρους.
Thus did the chiefs and rulers of the of the Phaeacians to king Poseidon, standing round his altar; and at the same time Odysseus woke up once more upon his own soil. He had been so long away that he did not know it again; moreover, Zeus’ daughter Athena had made it a foggy day, so that people might not know of his having come, and that she might tell him everything without either his wife or his fellow citizens and friends recognizing him until he had taken his revenge upon the wicked suitors. Everything, therefore, seemed quite different to him - the long straight tracks, the harbors, the precipices, and the goodly trees, appeared all changed as he started up and looked upon his native land. So he smote his thighs with the flat of his hands and cried aloud despairingly.	ὣς οἱ μέν ῥʼ εὔχοντο Ποσειδάωνι ἄνακτι δήμου Φαιήκων ἡγήτορες ἠδὲ μέδοντες, ἑσταότες περὶ βωμόν. ὁ δʼ ἔγρετο δῖος Ὀδυσσεὺς εὕδων ἐν γαίῃ πατρωΐῃ, οὐδέ μιν ἔγνω, ἤδη δὴν ἀπεών· περὶ γὰρ θεὸς ἠέρα χεῦε Παλλὰς Ἀθηναίη, κούρη Διός, ὄφρα μιν αὐτὸν ἄγνωστον τεύξειεν ἕκαστά τε μυθήσαιτο, μή μιν πρὶν ἄλοχος γνοίη ἀστοί τε φίλοι τε, πρὶν πᾶσαν μνηστῆρας ὑπερβασίην ἀποτῖσαι. τοὔνεκʼ ἄρʼ ἀλλοειδέα φαινέσκετο πάντα ἄνακτι, ἀτραπιτοί τε διηνεκέες λιμένες τε πάνορμοι πέτραι τʼ ἠλίβατοι καὶ δένδρεα τηλεθόωντα. στῆ δʼ ἄρʼ ἀναΐξας καί ῥʼ εἴσιδε πατρίδα γαῖαν· ᾤμωξέν τʼ ἄρ ἔπειτα καὶ ὣ πεπλήγετο μηρὼ χερσὶ καταπρηνέσσʼ, ὀλοφυρόμενος δʼ ἔπος ηὔδα·
"""Alas,"" he exclaimed, ""among what manner of people am I fallen? Are they savage and uncivilized not  or hospitable and endowed with god-fearing ? Where shall I put all this treasure, and which way shall I go? I wish I had stayed over there with the Phaeacians; or I could have gone to some other great chief who would have been good to me and given me an escort. As it is I do not know where to put my treasure, and I cannot leave it here for fear somebody else should get hold of it. In good truth the chiefs and rulers of the Phaeacians have not been dealing fairly   by me, and have left me in the wrong country; they said they would take me back to Ithaca and they have not done so: may Zeus the protector of suppliants chastise them, for he watches over everybody and punishes those who do wrong. Still, I suppose I must count my goods and see if the crew have gone off with any of them."""	ὤ μοι ἐγώ, τέων αὖτε βροτῶν ἐς γαῖαν ἱκάνω; ἦ ῥʼ οἵ γʼ ὑβρισταί τε καὶ ἄγριοι οὐδὲ δίκαιοι, ἦε φιλόξεινοι, καί σφιν νόος ἐστὶ θεουδής; πῇ δὴ χρήματα πολλὰ φέρω τάδε; πῇ τε καὶ αὐτὸς πλάζομαι; αἴθʼ ὄφελον μεῖναι παρὰ Φαιήκεσσιν αὐτοῦ· ἐγὼ δέ κεν ἄλλον ὑπερμενέων βασιλήων ἐξικόμην, ὅς κέν μʼ ἐφίλει καὶ ἔπεμπε νέεσθαι. νῦν δʼ οὔτʼ ἄρ πῃ θέσθαι ἐπίσταμαι, οὐδὲ μὲν αὐτοῦ καλλείψω, μή πώς μοι ἕλωρ ἄλλοισι γένηται. ὢ πόποι, οὐκ ἄρα πάντα νοήμονες οὐδὲ δίκαιοι ἦσαν Φαιήκων ἡγήτορες ἠδὲ μέδοντες, οἵ μʼ εἰς ἄλλην γαῖαν ἀπήγαγον, ἦ τέ μʼ ἔφαντο ἄξειν εἰς Ἰθάκην εὐδείελον, οὐδʼ ἐτέλεσσαν.

He counted his goodly coppers and cauldrons, his gold and all his clothes, but there was nothing missing; still he kept grieving about not being in his own country, and wandered up and down by the shore of the sounding sea bewailing his hard fate. Then Athena came up to him disguised as a young shepherd of delicate and princely mien, with a good cloak folded double about her shoulders; she had sandals on her comely feet and held a javelin in her hand. Odysseus was glad when he saw her, and went straight up to her.	ὣς εἰπὼν τρίποδας περικαλλέας ἠδὲ λέβητας ἠρίθμει καὶ χρυσὸν ὑφαντά τε εἵματα καλά. τῶν μὲν ἄρʼ ὀύ τι πόθει· ὁ δʼ ὀδύρετο πατρίδα γαῖαν ἑρπύζων παρὰ θῖνα πολυφλοίσβοιο θαλάσσης, πόλλʼ ὀλοφυρόμενος. σχεδόθεν δέ οἱ ἦλθεν Ἀθήνη, ἀνδρὶ δέμας εἰκυῖα νέῳ, ἐπιβώτορι μήλων, παναπάλῳ, οἷοί τε ἀνάκτων παῖδες ἔασι, δίπτυχον ἀμφʼ ὤμοισιν ἔχουσʼ εὐεργέα λώπην· ποσσὶ δʼ ὑπὸ λιπαροῖσι πέδιλʼ ἔχε, χερσὶ δʼ ἄκοντα. τὴν δʼ Ὀδυσεὺς γήθησεν ἰδὼν καὶ ἐναντίος ἦλθε, καί μιν φωνήσας ἔπεα πτερόεντα προσηύδα·
"""My friend,"" said he, ""you are the first person whom I have met with in this country; I salute you, therefore, and beg you to be well disposed in towards me. Protect these my goods, and myself too, for I embrace your knees and pray to you as though you were a god. Tell me, then, and tell me truly, what land and country   is this? Who are its inhabitants? Am I on an island, or is this the sea board of some continent?"""	ὦ φίλʼ, ἐπεί σε πρῶτα κιχάνω τῷδʼ ἐνὶ χώρῳ, χαῖρέ τε καὶ μή μοί τι κακῷ νόῳ ἀντιβολήσαις, ἀλλὰ σάω μὲν ταῦτα, σάω δʼ ἐμέ· σοὶ γὰρ ἐγώ γε εὔχομαι ὥς τε θεῷ καί σευ φίλα γούναθʼ ἱκάνω. καί μοι τοῦτʼ ἀγόρευσον ἐτήτυμον, ὄφρʼ ἐῢ εἰδῶ· τίς γῆ, τίς δῆμος, τίνες ἀνέρες ἐγγεγάασιν; ἦ πού τις νήσων εὐδείελος, ἦέ τις ἀκτὴ κεῖθʼ ἁλὶ κεκλιμένη ἐριβώλακος ἠπείροιο;
"Athena answered, ""Stranger, you must be very simple, or must have come from somewhere a long way off, not to know what country this is. It is a very celebrated place, and everybody knows it East and West. It is rugged and not a good driving country, but it is by no means a bad island for what there is of it. It grows any quantity of grain and also wine, for it is watered both by rain and dew; it breeds cattle also and goats; all kinds of timber grow here, and there are watering places where the water never runs dry; so, sir, the name of Ithaca is known even as far as Troy , which I understand to be a long way off from this Achaean country."""	τὸν δʼ αὖτε προσέειπε θεὰ γλαυκῶπις Ἀθήνη· νήπιός εἰς, ὦ ξεῖνʼ, ἢ τηλόθεν εἰλήλουθας, εἰ δὴ τήνδε τε γαῖαν ἀνείρεαι. οὐδέ τι λίην οὕτω νώνυμός ἐστιν· ἴσασι δέ μιν μάλα πολλοί, ἠμὲν ὅσοι ναίουσι πρὸς ἠῶ τʼ ἠέλιόν τε, ἠδʼ ὅσσοι μετόπισθε ποτὶ ζόφον ἠερόεντα. ἦ τοι μὲν τρηχεῖα καὶ οὐχ ἱππήλατός ἐστιν, οὐδὲ λίην λυπρή, ἀτὰρ οὐδʼ εὐρεῖα τέτυκται. ἐν μὲν γάρ οἱ σῖτος ἀθέσφατος, ἐν δέ τε οἶνος γίγνεται· αἰεὶ δʼ ὄμβρος ἔχει τεθαλυῖά τʼ ἐέρση· αἰγίβοτος δʼ ἀγαθὴ καὶ βούβοτος· ἔστι μὲν ὕλη παντοίη, ἐν δʼ ἀρδμοὶ ἐπηετανοὶ παρέασι. τῷ τοι, ξεῖνʼ, Ἰθάκης γε καὶ ἐς Τροίην ὄνομʼ ἵκει, τήν περ τηλοῦ φασὶν Ἀχαιΐδος ἔμμεναι αἴης.
Odysseus was glad at finding himself, as Athena told him, in his own country, and he began to answer, but he did not speak the truth  , and made up a lying story in the instinctive wiliness of his .	ὣς φάτο, γήθησεν δὲ πολύτλας δῖος Ὀδυσσεύς, χαίρων ᾗ γαίῃ πατρωΐῃ, ὥς οἱ ἔειπε Παλλὰς Ἀθηναίη, κούρη Διὸς, αἰγιόχοιο· καί μιν φωνήσας ἔπεα πτερόεντα προσηύδα· οὐδʼ ὅ γʼ ἀληθέα εἶπε, πάλιν δʼ ὅ γε λάζετο μῦθον, αἰεὶ ἐνὶ στήθεσσι νόον πολυκερδέα νωμῶν·
"""I heard of Ithaca ,"" said he, ""when I was in Crete beyond the seas, and now it seems I have reached it with all these treasures. I have left as much more behind me for my children, but am fleeing because I killed Orsilokhos son of Idomeneus, the fleetest runner in Crete . I killed him because he wanted to rob me of the spoils I had got from Troy with so much trouble and danger both on the field of battle and by the waves of the weary sea; he said I had not served his father loyally in the Trojan as vassal, but had set myself up as an independent ruler, so I lay in wait for him and with one of my followers by the road side, and speared him as he was coming into town from the country. It was a very dark night and nobody saw us; it was not known, therefore, that I had killed him, but as soon as I had done so I went to a ship and besought the owners, who were Phoenicians, to take me on board and set me in Pylos or in Elis where the Epeans rule, giving them as much spoil as satisfied them. They meant no guile, but the wind drove them off their course, and we sailed on till we came hither by night. It was all we could do to get inside the harbor, and none of us said a word about supper though we wanted it badly, but we all went on shore and lay down just as we were. I was very tired and fell asleep directly, so they took my goods out of the ship, and placed them beside me where I was lying upon the sand. Then they sailed away to Sidonia, and I was left here in great distress of mind."""	πυνθανόμην Ἰθάκης γε καὶ ἐν Κρήτῃ εὐρείῃ, τηλοῦ ὑπὲρ πόντου· νῦν δʼ εἰλήλουθα καὶ αὐτὸς χρήμασι σὺν τοίσδεσσι· λιπὼν δʼ ἔτι παισὶ τοσαῦτα φεύγω, ἐπεὶ φίλον υἷα κατέκτανον Ἰδομενῆος, Ὀρσίλοχον πόδας ὠκύν, ὃς ἐν Κρήτῃ εὐρείῃ ἀνέρας ἀλφηστὰς νίκα ταχέεσσι πόδεσσιν, οὕνεκά με στερέσαι τῆς ληΐδος ἤθελε πάσης Τρωϊάδος, τῆς εἵνεκʼ ἐγὼ πάθον ἄλγεα θυμῷ, ἀνδρῶν τε πτολέμους ἀλεγεινά τε κύματα πείρων, οὕνεκʼ ἄρʼ οὐχ ᾧ πατρὶ χαριζόμενος θεράπευον δήμῳ ἔνι Τρώων, ἀλλʼ ἄλλων ἦρχον ἑταίρων. τὸν μὲν ἐγὼ κατιόντα βάλον χαλκήρεϊ δουρὶ ἀγρόθεν, ἐγγὺς ὁδοῖο λοχησάμενος σὺν ἑταίρῳ· νὺξ δὲ μάλα δνοφερὴ κάτεχʼ οὐρανόν, οὐδέ τις ἡμέας ἀνθρώπων ἐνόησε, λάθον δέ ἑ θυμὸν ἀπούρας. αὐτὰρ ἐπεὶ δὴ τόν γε κατέκτανον ὀξέϊ χαλκῷ, αὐτίκʼ ἐγὼν ἐπὶ νῆα κιὼν Φοίνικας ἀγαυοὺς ἐλλισάμην, καί σφιν μενοεικέα ληΐδα δῶκα· τούς μʼ ἐκέλευσα Πύλονδε καταστῆσαι καὶ ἐφέσσαι ἢ εἰς Ἤλιδα δῖαν, ὅθι κρατέουσιν Ἐπειοί. ἀλλʼ ἦ τοι σφέας κεῖθεν ἀπώσατο ἲς ἀνέμοιο πόλλʼ ἀεκαζομένους, οὐδʼ ἤθελον ἐξαπατῆσαι. κεῖθεν δὲ πλαγχθέντες ἱκάνομεν ἐνθάδε νυκτός. σπουδῇ δʼ ἐς λιμένα προερέσσαμεν, οὐδέ τις ἡμῖν δόρπου μνῆστις ἔην, μάλα περ χατέουσιν ἑλέσθαι, ἀλλʼ αὔτως ἀποβάντες ἐκείμεθα νηὸς ἅπαντες. ἔνθʼ ἐμὲ μὲν γλυκὺς ὕπνος ἐπήλυθε κεκμηῶτα, οἱ δὲ χρήματʼ ἐμὰ γλαφυρῆς ἐκ νηὸς ἑλόντες κάτθεσαν, ἔνθα περ αὐτὸς ἐπὶ ψαμάθοισιν ἐκείμην. οἱ δʼ ἐς Σιδονίην εὖ ναιομένην ἀναβάντες ᾤχοντʼ· αὐτὰρ ἐγὼ λιπόμην ἀκαχήμενος ἦτορ.
"Such was his story, but Athena smiled and caressed him with her hand. Then she took the form of a woman, fair, stately, and wise, ""He must be indeed a shifty and deceitful person,"" said she, ""who could surpass you in all manner of craft   even though you had a god for your antagonist. Daring that you are, full of guile, unwearying in deceit  , can you not drop your tricks and your instinctive falsehood, even now that you are in your own country again? We will say no more, however, about this, for we both of us know craftiness   upon occasion - you are the best counselor and orator among all humankind, while I for diplomacy and crafty ways   have fame   among the gods. Did you not know Zeus’ daughter Athena - me, who have been ever with you, who kept watch over you in all your ordeals  , and who made the Phaeacians take so great a liking to you? And now, again, I am come here to talk things over with you, and help you to hide the treasure I made the Phaeacians give you; I want to tell you about the troubles that await you in your own house; you have got to face them, but tell no one, neither man nor woman, that you have come home again. Bear everything, and put up with every man's violent insolence  , without a word."""	ὣς φάτο, μείδησεν δὲ θεὰ γλαυκῶπις Ἀθήνη, χειρί τέ μιν κατέρεξε· δέμας δʼ ἤϊκτο γυναικὶ καλῇ τε μεγάλῃ τε καὶ ἀγλαὰ ἔργα ἰδυίῃ· καί μιν φωνήσασʼ ἔπεα πτερόεντα προσηύδα· κερδαλέος κʼ εἴη καὶ ἐπίκλοπος ὅς σε παρέλθοι ἐν πάντεσσι δόλοισι, καὶ εἰ θεὸς ἀντιάσειε. σχέτλιε, ποικιλομῆτα, δόλων ἆτʼ, οὐκ ἄρʼ ἔμελλες, οὐδʼ ἐν σῇ περ ἐὼν γαίῃ, λήξειν ἀπατάων μύθων τε κλοπίων, οἵ τοι πεδόθεν φίλοι εἰσίν. ἀλλʼ ἄγε, μηκέτι ταῦτα λεγώμεθα, εἰδότες ἄμφω κέρδεʼ, ἐπεὶ σὺ μέν ἐσσι βροτῶν ὄχʼ ἄριστος ἁπάντων βουλῇ καὶ μύθοισιν, ἐγὼ δʼ ἐν πᾶσι θεοῖσι μήτι τε κλέομαι καὶ κέρδεσιν· οὐδὲ σύ γʼ ἔγνως Παλλάδʼ Ἀθηναίην, κούρην Διός, ἥ τέ τοι αἰεὶ ἐν πάντεσσι πόνοισι παρίσταμαι ἠδὲ φυλάσσω, καὶ δέ σε Φαιήκεσσι φίλον πάντεσσιν ἔθηκα, νῦν αὖ δεῦρʼ ἱκόμην, ἵνα τοι σὺν μῆτιν ὑφήνω χρήματά τε κρύψω, ὅσα τοι Φαίηκες ἀγαυοὶ ὤπασαν οἴκαδʼ ἰόντι ἐμῇ βουλῇ τε νόῳ τε, εἴπω θʼ ὅσσα τοι αἶσα δόμοις ἔνι ποιητοῖσι κήδεʼ ἀνασχέσθαι· σὺ δὲ τετλάμεναι καὶ ἀνάγκῃ, μηδέ τῳ ἐκφάσθαι μήτʼ ἀνδρῶν μήτε γυναικῶν, πάντων, οὕνεκʼ ἄρʼ ἦλθες ἀλώμενος, ἀλλὰ σιωπῇ πάσχειν ἄλγεα πολλά, βίας ὑποδέγμενος ἀνδρῶν.
"And Odysseus answered, ""A man, goddess, may know a great deal, but you are so constantly changing your appearance that when he meets you it is a hard matter for him to know whether it is you or not. This much, however, I know exceedingly well; you were very kind to me as long as we Achaeans were fighting before Troy , but from the day on which we went on board ship after having sacked the city of Priam, and heaven dispersed us - from that day, Athena, I saw no more of you, and cannot ever remember your coming to my ship to help me in a difficulty; I had to wander on sick and sorry till the gods delivered me from evil and I reached the of the Phaeacians, where you encouraged me and took me into the town. And now, I beseech you in your father's name, tell me the truth, for I do not believe I am really back in Ithaca . I am in some other country and you are mocking me and deceiving me in all you have been saying. Tell me then truly, have I really got back to my own country?"""	τὴν δʼ ἀπαμειβόμενος προσέφη πολύμητις Ὀδυσσεύς· ἀργαλέον σε, θεά, γνῶναι βροτῷ ἀντιάσαντι, καὶ μάλʼ ἐπισταμένῳ· σὲ γὰρ αὐτὴν παντὶ ἐΐσκεις. τοῦτο δʼ ἐγὼν εὖ οἶδʼ, ὅτι μοι πάρος ἠπίη ἦσθα, ἧος ἐνὶ Τροίῃ πολεμίζομεν υἷες Ἀχαιῶν. αὐτὰρ ἐπεὶ Πριάμοιο πόλιν διεπέρσαμεν αἰπήν, βῆμεν δʼ ἐν νήεσσι, θεὸς δʼ ἐκέδασσεν Ἀχαιούς, οὔ σέ γʼ ἔπειτα ἴδον, κούρη Διός, οὐδʼ ἐνόησα νηὸς ἐμῆς ἐπιβᾶσαν, ὅπως τί μοι ἄλγος ἀλάλκοις. ἀλλʼ αἰεὶ φρεσὶν ᾗσιν ἔχων δεδαϊγμένον ἦτορ ἠλώμην, ἧός με θεοὶ κακότητος ἔλυσαν· πρίν γʼ ὅτε Φαιήκων ἀνδρῶν ἐν πίονι δήμῳ θάρσυνάς τε ἔπεσσι καὶ ἐς πόλιν ἤγαγες αὐτή. νῦν δέ σε πρὸς πατρὸς γουνάζομαι—οὐ γὰρ ὀΐω ἥκειν εἰς Ἰθάκην εὐδείελον, ἀλλά τινʼ ἄλλην γαῖαν ἀναστρέφομαι· σὲ δὲ κερτομέουσαν ὀΐω ταῦτʼ ἀγορευέμεναι, ἵνʼ ἐμὰς φρένας ἠπεροπεύσῃς— εἰπέ μοι εἰ ἐτεόν γε φίλην ἐς πατρίδʼ ἱκάνω.
"""You are always taking something of that sort into your head,"" replied Athena, ""and that is why I cannot desert you in your afflictions; you are so plausible, shrewd and shifty. Any one but yourself on returning from so long a voyage would at once have gone home to see his wife and children, but you do not seem to care about asking after them or hearing any news about them till you have made trial of your wife, who remains at home vainly grieving for you, and having no peace night or day for the tears she sheds on your behalf. As for my not coming near you, I was never uneasy about you, for I was certain you would get back safely though you would lose all your men, and I did not wish to quarrel with my uncle Poseidon, who never forgave you for having blinded his son. I will now, however, point out to you the lie of the land, and you will then perhaps believe me. This is the haven of the Old One of the Sea, Phorkys, and here is the olive tree that grows at the head of it; near it is the cave sacred to the Naiads; here too is the overarching cavern in which you have offered many an acceptable hecatomb to the nymphs, and this is the wooded mountain Neritum."""	τὸν δʼ ἠμείβετʼ ἔπειτα θεὰ γλαυκῶπις Ἀθήνη· αἰεί τοι τοιοῦτον ἐνὶ στήθεσσι νόημα· τῷ σε καὶ οὐ δύναμαι προλιπεῖν δύστηνον ἐόντα, οὕνεκʼ ἐπητής ἐσσι καὶ ἀγχίνοος καὶ ἐχέφρων. ἀσπασίως γάρ κʼ ἄλλος ἀνὴρ ἀλαλήμενος ἐλθὼν ἵετʼ ἐνὶ μεγάροις ἰδέειν παῖδάς τʼ ἄλοχόν τε· σοὶ δʼ οὔ πω φίλον ἐστὶ δαήμεναι οὐδὲ πυθέσθαι, πρίν γʼ ἔτι σῆς ἀλόχου πειρήσεαι, ἥ τέ τοι αὔτως ἧσται ἐνὶ μεγάροισιν, ὀϊζυραὶ δέ οἱ αἰεὶ φθίνουσιν νύκτες τε καὶ ἤματα δάκρυ χεούσῃ. αὐτὰρ ἐγὼ τὸ μὲν οὔ ποτʼ ἀπίστεον, ἀλλʼ ἐνὶ θυμῷ ᾔδεʼ, ὃ νοστήσεις ὀλέσας ἄπο πάντας ἑταίρους· ἀλλά τοι οὐκ ἐθέλησα Ποσειδάωνι μάχεσθαι πατροκασιγνήτῳ, ὅς τοι κότον ἔνθετο θυμῷ, χωόμενος ὅτι οἱ υἱὸν φίλον ἐξαλάωσας. ἀλλʼ ἄγε τοι δείξω Ἰθάκης ἕδος, ὄφρα πεποίθῃς.

"As she spoke the goddess dispersed the mist and the land appeared. Then Odysseus rejoiced at finding himself again in his own land, and kissed the bounteous soil; he lifted up his hands and prayed to the nymphs, saying, ""Naiad nymphs, daughters of Zeus, I made sure that I was never again to see you, now therefore I greet you with all loving salutations, and I will bring you offerings as in the old days, if Zeus’ redoubtable daughter will grant me life, and bring my son to manhood."""	ὣς εἰποῦσα θεὰ σκέδασʼ ἠέρα, εἴσατο δὲ χθών· γήθησέν τʼ ἄρʼ ἔπειτα πολύτλας δῖος Ὀδυσσεύς, χαίρων ᾗ γαίῃ, κύσε δὲ ζείδωρον ἄρουραν. αὐτίκα δὲ νύμφῃς ἠρήσατο, χεῖρας ἀνασχών· νύμφαι νηϊάδες, κοῦραι Διός, οὔ ποτʼ ἐγώ γε ὄψεσθʼ ὔμμʼ ἐφάμην· νῦν δʼ εὐχωλῇς ἀγανῇσι χαίρετʼ· ἀτὰρ καὶ δῶρα διδώσομεν, ὡς τὸ πάρος περ, αἴ κεν ἐᾷ πρόφρων με Διὸς θυγάτηρ ἀγελείη αὐτόν τε ζώειν καί μοι φίλον υἱὸν ἀέξῃ. τὸν δʼ αὖτε προσέειπε θεὰ γλαυκῶπις Ἀθήνη·

Therewith she went down into the cave to look for the safest hiding places, while Odysseus brought up all the treasure of gold, bronze, and good clothing which the Phaeacians had given him. They stowed everything carefully away, and Athena set a stone against the door of the cave. Then the two sat down by the root of the great olive, and consulted how to compass the destruction of the wicked suitors.	ὣς εἰποῦσα θεὰ δῦνε σπέος ἠεροειδές, μαιομένη κευθμῶνας ἀνὰ σπέος· αὐτὰρ Ὀδυσσεὺς ἆσσον πάντʼ ἐφόρει, χρυσὸν καὶ ἀτειρέα χαλκὸν εἵματά τʼ εὐποίητα, τά οἱ Φαίηκες ἔδωκαν. καὶ τὰ μὲν εὖ κατέθηκε, λίθον δʼ ἐπέθηκε θύρῃσι Παλλὰς Ἀθηναίη, κούρη Διὸς αἰγιόχοιο. τὼ δὲ καθεζομένω ἱερῆς παρὰ πυθμένʼ ἐλαίης φραζέσθην μνηστῆρσιν ὑπερφιάλοισιν ὄλεθρον. τοῖσι δὲ μύθων ἦρχε θεὰ γλαυκῶπις Ἀθήνη·

Advise me how I shall best avenge myself. Stand by my side and put your courage into my heart as on the day when we loosed Troy 's fair diadem from her brow.

I will begin by disguising you so that no human being shall know you; I will cover your body with wrinkles; you shall lose all your yellow hair; I will clothe you in a garment that shall fill all who see it with loathing; I will blear your fine eyes for you, and make you an unseemly object in the sight of the suitors, of your wife, and of the son whom you left behind you. Then go at once to the swineherd who is in charge of your pigs; he has been always well affected towards you, and is devoted to Penelope and your son; you will find him feeding his pigs near the rock that is called Raven by the fountain Arethusa, where they are fattening on beechmast and spring water after their manner. Stay with him and find out how things are going, while I proceed to Sparta and see your son, who is with Menelaos at Lacedaemon , where he has gone to try and find a report   on whether you are still alive."""	καὶ λίην τοι ἐγώ γε παρέσσομαι, οὐδέ με λήσεις, ὁππότε κεν δὴ ταῦτα πενώμεθα· καί τινʼ ὀΐω αἵματί τʼ ἐγκεφάλῳ τε παλαξέμεν ἄσπετον οὖδας ἀνδρῶν μνηστήρων, οἵ τοι βίοτον κατέδουσιν. ἀλλʼ ἄγε σʼ ἄγνωστον τεύξω πάντεσσι βροτοῖσι· κάρψω μὲν χρόα καλὸν ἐνὶ γναμπτοῖσι μέλεσσι, ξανθὰς δʼ ἐκ κεφαλῆς ὀλέσω τρίχας, ἀμφὶ δὲ λαῖφος ἕσσω ὅ κε στυγέῃσιν ἰδὼν ἄνθρωπον ἔχοντα, κνυζώσω δέ τοι ὄσσε πάρος περικαλλέʼ ἐόντε, ὡς ἂν ἀεικέλιος πᾶσι μνηστῆρσι φανήῃς σῇ τʼ ἀλόχῳ καὶ παιδί, τὸν ἐν μεγάροισιν ἔλειπες. αὐτὸς δὲ πρώτιστα συβώτην εἰσαφικέσθαι, ὅς τοι ὑῶν ἐπίουρος, ὁμῶς δέ τοι ἤπια οἶδε, παῖδά τε σὸν φιλέει καὶ ἐχέφρονα Πηνελόπειαν. δήεις τόν γε σύεσσι παρήμενον· αἱ δὲ νέμονται πὰρ Κόρακος πέτρῃ ἐπί τε κρήνῃ Ἀρεθούσῃ, ἔσθουσαι βάλανον μενοεικέα καὶ μέλαν ὕδωρ πίνουσαι, τά θʼ ὕεσσι τρέφει τεθαλυῖαν ἀλοιφήν. ἔνθα μένειν καὶ πάντα παρήμενος ἐξερέεσθαι, ὄφρʼ ἂν ἐγὼν ἔλθω Σπάρτην ἐς καλλιγύναικα Τηλέμαχον καλέουσα, τεὸν φίλον υἱόν, Ὀδυσσεῦ· ὅς τοι ἐς εὐρύχορον Λακεδαίμονα πὰρ Μενέλαον ᾤχετο πευσόμενος μετὰ σὸν κλέος, εἴ που ἔτʼ εἴης.
"""But why,"" said Odysseus, ""did you not tell him, for you knew all about it? Did you want him too to go sailing about amid all kinds of hardship while others are eating up his estate?"""	τὴν δʼ ἀπαμειβόμενος προσέφη πολύμητις Ὀδυσσεύς· τίπτε τʼ ἄρʼ οὔ οἱ ἔειπες, ἐνὶ φρεσὶ πάντα ἰδυῖα; ἦ ἵνα που καὶ κεῖνος ἀλώμενος ἄλγεα πάσχῃ πόντον ἐπʼ ἀτρύγετον· βίοτον δέ οἱ ἄλλοι ἔδουσι;
"Athena answered, ""Never mind about him, I sent him that he might be well spoken   of for having gone. He is in no sort of difficulty  , but is staying quite comfortably with Menelaos, and is surrounded with abundance of every kind. The suitors have put out to sea and are lying in wait for him, for they mean to kill him before he can get home. I do not much think they will succeed, but rather that some of those who are now eating up your estate will first find a grave themselves."""	τὸν δʼ ἠμείβετʼ ἔπειτα θεὰ γλαυκῶπις Ἀθήνη· μὴ δή τοι κεῖνός γε λίην ἐνθύμιος ἔστω. αὐτή μιν πόμπευον, ἵνα κλέος ἐσθλὸν ἄροιτο κεῖσʼ ἐλθών· ἀτὰρ οὔ τινʼ ἔχει πόνον, ἀλλὰ ἕκηλος ἧσται ἐν Ἀτρεΐδαο δόμοις, παρὰ δʼ ἄσπετα κεῖται. ἦ μέν μιν λοχόωσι νέοι σὺν νηῒ μελαίνῃ, ἱέμενοι κτεῖναι, πρὶν πατρίδα γαῖαν ἱκέσθαι· ἀλλὰ τά γʼ οὐκ ὀΐω, πρὶν καί τινα γαῖα καθέξει ἀνδρῶν μνηστήρων, οἵ τοι βίοτον κατέδουσιν.
As she spoke Athena touched him with her wand and covered him with wrinkles, took away all his yellow hair, and withered the flesh over his whole body; she bleared his eyes, which were naturally very fine ones; she changed his clothes and threw an old rag of a wrap about him, and a tunic, tattered, filthy, and begrimed with smoke; she also gave him an undressed deer skin as an outer garment, and furnished him with a staff and a wallet all in holes, with a twisted thong for him to sling it over his shoulder.	ὣς ἄρα μιν φαμένη ῥάβδῳ ἐπεμάσσατʼ Ἀθήνη. κάρψεν μὲν χρόα καλὸν ἐνὶ γναμπτοῖσι μέλεσσι, ξανθὰς δʼ ἐκ κεφαλῆς ὄλεσε τρίχας, ἀμφὶ δὲ δέρμα πάντεσσιν μελέεσσι παλαιοῦ θῆκε γέροντος, κνύζωσεν δέ οἱ ὄσσε πάρος περικαλλέʼ ἐόντε· ἀμφὶ δέ μιν ῥάκος ἄλλο κακὸν βάλεν ἠδὲ χιτῶνα, ῥωγαλέα ῥυπόωντα, κακῷ μεμορυγμένα καπνῷ· ἀμφὶ δέ μιν μέγα δέρμα ταχείης ἕσσʼ ἐλάφοιο, ψιλόν· δῶκε δέ οἱ σκῆπτρον καὶ ἀεικέα πήρην, πυκνὰ ῥωγαλέην· ἐν δὲ στρόφος ἦεν ἀορτήρ.
When the pair had thus laid their plans they parted, and the goddess went straight to Lacedaemon to fetch Telemakhos.	τώ γʼ ὣς βουλεύσαντε διέτμαγεν. ἡ μὲν ἔπειτα
Odysseus now left the haven, and took the rough track up through the wooded country and over the crest of the mountain till he reached the place where Athena had said that he would find the swineherd, who was the most thrifty servant he had. He found him sitting in front of his hut, which was by the yards that he had built on a site which could be seen from far. He had made them spacious and fair to see, with a free ran for the pigs all round them; he had built them during his master's absence, of stones which he had gathered out of the ground, without saying anything to Penelope or Laertes , and he had fenced them on top with thorn bushes. Outside the yard he had run a strong fence of oaken posts, split, and set pretty close together, while inside lie had built twelve sties near one another for the sows to lie in. There were fifty pigs wallowing in each sty, all of them breeding sows; but the boars slept outside and were much fewer in number, for the suitors kept on eating them, and the swineherd had to send them the best he had continually. There were three hundred and sixty boar pigs, and the herdsman's four hounds, which were as fierce as wolves, slept always with them. The swineherd was at that moment cutting out a pair of sandals from a good stout ox hide. Three of his men were out herding the pigs in one place or another, and he had sent the fourth to town with a boar that he had been forced to send the suitors that they might sacrifice it and have their fill of meat.	αὐτὰρ ὁ ἐκ λιμένος προσέβη τρηχεῖαν ἀταρπὸν χῶρον ἀνʼ ὑλήεντα διʼ ἄκριας, ᾗ οἱ Ἀθήνη πέφραδε δῖον ὑφορβόν, ὅ οἱ βιότοιο μάλιστα κήδετο οἰκήων, οὓς κτήσατο δῖος Ὀδυσσεύς. τὸν δʼ ἄρʼ ἐνὶ προδόμῳ εὗρʼ ἥμενον, ἔνθα οἱ αὐλὴ ὑψηλὴ δέδμητο, περισκέπτῳ ἐνὶ χώρῳ, καλή τε μεγάλη τε, περίδρομος· ἥν ῥα συβώτης αὐτὸς δείμαθʼ ὕεσσιν ἀποιχομένοιο ἄνακτος, νόσφιν δεσποίνης καὶ Λαέρταο γέροντος, ῥυτοῖσιν λάεσσι καὶ ἐθρίγκωσεν ἀχέρδῳ· σταυροὺς δʼ ἐκτὸς ἔλασσε διαμπερὲς ἔνθα καὶ ἔνθα, πυκνοὺς καὶ θαμέας, τὸ μέλαν δρυὸς ἀμφικεάσσας· ἔντοσθεν δʼ αὐλῆς συφεοὺς δυοκαίδεκα ποίει πλησίον ἀλλήλων, εὐνὰς συσίν· ἐν δὲ ἑκάστῳ πεντήκοντα σύες χαμαιευνάδες ἐρχατόωντο, θήλειαι τοκάδες· τοὶ δʼ ἄρσενες ἐκτὸς ἴαυον, πολλὸν παυρότεροι· τοὺς γὰρ μινύθεσκον ἔδοντες ἀντίθεοι μνηστῆρες, ἐπεὶ προΐαλλε συβώτης αἰεὶ ζατρεφέων σιάλων τὸν ἄριστον ἁπάντων· οἱ δὲ τριηκόσιοί τε καὶ ἑξήκοντα πέλοντο. πὰρ δὲ κύνες, θήρεσσιν ἐοικότες αἰὲν ἴαυον τέσσαρες, οὓς ἔθρεψε συβώτης, ὄρχαμος ἀνδρῶν. αὐτὸς δʼ ἀμφὶ πόδεσσιν ἑοῖς ἀράρισκε πέδιλα, τάμνων δέρμα βόειον ἐϋχροές· οἱ δὲ δὴ ἄλλοι ᾤχοντʼ ἄλλυδις ἄλλος ἅμʼ ἀγρομένοισι σύεσσιν, οἱ τρεῖς· τὸν δὲ τέταρτον ἀποπροέηκε πόλινδε σῦν ἀγέμεν μνηστῆρσιν ὑπερφιάλοισιν ἀνάγκῃ, ὄφρʼ ἱερεύσαντες κρειῶν κορεσαίατο θυμόν.
"When the hounds saw Odysseus they set up a furious barking and flew at him, but Odysseus was cunning enough to sit down and loose his hold of the stick that he had in his hand: still, he would have been torn by them in his own homestead had not the swineherd dropped his ox hide, rushed full speed through the gate of the yard and driven the dogs off by shouting and throwing stones at them. Then he said to Odysseus, ""Old man, the dogs were likely to have made short work of you, and then you would have got me into trouble. The gods have given me quite enough worries without that, for I have lost the best of masters, and am in continual grief on his account. I have to attend swine for other people to eat, while he, if he yet lives to see the light of day, is starving in some distant . But come inside, and when you have had your fill of bread and wine, tell me where you come from, and all about your misfortunes."""	ἐξαπίνης δʼ Ὀδυσῆα ἴδον κύνες ὑλακόμωροι. οἱ μὲν κεκλήγοντες ἐπέδραμον· αὐτὰρ Ὀδυσσεὺς ἕζετο κερδοσύνη, σκῆπτρον δέ οἱ ἔκπεσε χειρός. ἔνθα κεν ᾧ πὰρ σταθμῷ ἀεικέλιον πάθεν ἄλγος· ἀλλὰ συβώτης ὦκα ποσὶ κραιπνοῖσι μετασπὼν ἔσσυτʼ ἀνὰ πρόθυρον, σκῦτος δέ οἱ ἔκπεσε χειρός. τοὺς μὲν ὁμοκλήσας σεῦεν κύνας ἄλλυδις ἄλλον πυκνῇσιν λιθάδεσσιν· ὁ δὲ προσέειπεν ἄνακτα· ὦ γέρον, ἦ ὀλίγου σε κύνες διεδηλήσαντο ἐξαπίνης, καί κέν μοι ἐλεγχείην κατέχευας. καὶ δέ μοι ἄλλα θεοὶ δόσαν ἄλγεά τε στοναχάς τε· ἀντιθέου γὰρ ἄνακτος ὀδυρόμενος καὶ ἀχεύων ἧμαι, ἄλλοισιν δὲ σύας σιάλους ἀτιτάλλω ἔδμεναι· αὐτὰρ κεῖνος ἐελδόμενός που ἐδωδῆς πλάζετʼ ἐπʼ ἀλλοθρόων ἀνδρῶν δῆμόν τε πόλιν τε, εἴ που ἔτι ζώει καὶ ὁρᾷ φάος ἠελίοιο. ἀλλʼ ἕπεο, κλισίηνδʼ ἴομεν, γέρον, ὄφρα καὶ αὐτός, σίτου καὶ οἴνοιο κορεσσάμενος κατὰ θυμόν, εἴπῃς ὁππόθεν ἐσσὶ καὶ ὁππόσα κήδεʼ ἀνέτλης.
"On this the swineherd led the way into the hut and bade him sit down. He strewed a good thick bed of rushes upon the floor, and on the top of this he threw the shaggy chamois skin - a great thick one - on which he used to sleep by night. Odysseus was pleased at being made thus welcome, and said ""May Zeus, sir, and the rest of the gods grant you your heart's desire in return for the kind way in which you have received me."""	ὣς εἰπὼν κλισίηνδʼ ἡγήσατο δῖος ὑφορβός, εἷσεν δʼ εἰσαγαγών, ῥῶπας δʼ ὑπέχευε δασείας, ἐστόρεσεν δʼ ἐπὶ δέρμα ἰονθάδος ἀγρίου αἰγός, αὐτοῦ ἐνεύναιον, μέγα καὶ δασύ. χαῖρε δʼ Ὀδυσσεὺς ὅττι μιν ὣς ὑπέδεκτο, ἔπος τʼ ἔφατʼ ἔκ τʼ ὀνόμαζεν· Ζεύς τοι δοίη, ξεῖνε, καὶ ἀθάνατοι θεοὶ ἄλλοι ὅττι μάλιστʼ ἐθέλεις, ὅτι με πρόφρων ὑπέδεξο.
"To this you answered, O swineherd Eumaios, ""Stranger, though a still poorer man should come here, it would not be right for me to insult him, for all strangers and beggars are from Zeus. You must take what you can get and be thankful, for servants live in fear when they have young lords for their masters; and this is my misfortune now, for heaven has hindered the return   of him who would have been always good to me and given me something of my own - a house, a piece of land, a good looking wife, and all else that a liberal master allows a servant who has worked hard for him, and whose labor the gods have prospered as they have mine in the situation which I hold. If my master had grown old here he would have done great things by me, but he is gone, and I wish that Helen's whole race were utterly destroyed, for she has been the death of many a good man. It was this matter that took my master to Ilion , the land of noble steeds, to fight the Trojans in the cause of king Agamemnon."""	τὸν δʼ ἀπαμειβόμενος προσέφης, Εὔμαιε συβῶτα· ξεῖνʼ, οὔ μοι θέμις ἔστʼ, οὐδʼ εἰ κακίων σέθεν ἔλθοι, ξεῖνον ἀτιμῆσαι· πρὸς γὰρ Διός εἰσιν ἅπαντες ξεῖνοί τε πτωχοί τε· δόσις δʼ ὀλίγη τε φίλη τε γίγνεται ἡμετέρη· ἡ γὰρ δμώων δίκη ἐστὶν αἰεὶ δειδιότων, ὅτʼ ἐπικρατέωσιν ἄνακτες οἱ νέοι. ἦ γὰρ τοῦ γε θεοὶ κατὰ νόστον ἔδησαν, ὅς κεν ἔμʼ ἐνδυκέως ἐφίλει καὶ κτῆσιν ὄπασσεν, οἶκόν τε κλῆρόν τε πολυμνήστην τε γυναῖκα, οἷά τε ᾧ οἰκῆϊ ἄναξ εὔθυμος ἔδωκεν, ὅς οἱ πολλὰ κάμῃσι, θεὸς δʼ ἐπὶ ἔργον ἀέξῃ, ὡς καὶ ἐμοὶ τόδε ἔργον ἀέξεται, ᾧ ἐπιμίμνω. τῷ κέ με πόλλʼ ὤνησεν ἄναξ, εἰ αὐτόθʼ ἐγήρα· ἀλλʼ ὄλεθʼ—ὡς ὤφελλʼ Ἑλένης ἀπὸ φῦλον ὀλέσθαι πρόχνυ, ἐπεὶ πολλῶν ἀνδρῶν ὑπὸ γούνατʼ ἔλυσε· καὶ γὰρ κεῖνος ἔβη Ἀγαμέμνονος εἵνεκα τιμῆς Ἴλιον εἰς εὔπωλον, ἵνα Τρώεσσι μάχοιτο.
As he spoke he bound his belt round him and went to the sties where the young sucking pigs were penned. He picked out two which he brought back with him and sacrificed. He singed them, cut them up, and spitted on them; when the meat was cooked he brought it all in and set it before Odysseus, hot and still on the spit, whereon Odysseus sprinkled it over with white barley meal. The swineherd then mixed wine in a bowl of ivy-wood, and taking a seat opposite Odysseus told him to begin.	ὣς εἰπὼν ζωστῆρι θοῶς συνέεργε χιτῶνα, βῆ δʼ ἴμεν ἐς συφεούς, ὅθι ἔθνεα ἔρχατο χοίρων. ἔνθεν ἑλὼν δύʼ ἔνεικε καὶ ἀμφοτέρους ἱέρευσεν, εὗσέ τε μίστυλλέν τε καὶ ἀμφʼ ὀβελοῖσιν ἔπειρεν. ὀπτήσας δʼ ἄρα πάντα φέρων παρέθηκʼ Ὀδυσῆϊ θέρμʼ αὐτοῖς ὀβελοῖσιν· ὁ δʼ ἄλφιτα λευκὰ πάλυνεν· ἐν δʼ ἄρα κισσυβίῳ κίρνη μελιηδέα οἶνον, αὐτὸς δʼ ἀντίον ἷζεν, ἐποτρύνων δὲ προσηύδα·
"""Fall to, stranger,"" said he, ""on a dish of servant's pork. The fat pigs have to go to the suitors, who eat them up without shame or scruple; but the blessed gods love not such shameful doings, and respect those who do what is lawful and right  . Even the fierce free-booters who go raiding on other people's land, and Zeus gives them their spoil - even they, when they have filled their ships and got home again live conscience-stricken, and look fearfully for judgment; but some god seems to have told these people that Odysseus is dead and gone; they will not, therefore, go back to their own homes and make their offers of marriage in the proper way  , but waste his estate by force, without fear or stint. Not a day or night comes out of heaven, but they sacrifice not one victim nor two only, and they take the run of his wine, for he was exceedingly rich. No other great man either in Ithaca or on the mainland is as rich as he was; he had as much as twenty men put together. I will tell you what he had. There are twelve herds of cattle upon the mainland, and as many flocks of sheep, there are also twelve droves of pigs, while his own men and hired strangers feed him twelve widely spreading herds of goats. Here in Ithaca he runs even large flocks of goats on the far end of the island, and they are in the charge of excellent goatherds. Each one of these sends the suitors the best goat in the flock every day. As for myself, I am in charge of the pigs that you see here, and I have to keep picking   out the best I have and sending it to them."""	ἔσθιε νῦν, ὦ ξεῖνε, τά τε δμώεσσι πάρεστι, χοίρεʼ· ἀτὰρ σιάλους γε σύας μνηστῆρες ἔδουσιν, οὐκ ὄπιδα φρονέοντες ἐνὶ φρεσὶν οὐδʼ ἐλεητύν. οὐ μὲν σχέτλια ἔργα θεοὶ μάκαρες φιλέουσιν, ἀλλὰ δίκην τίουσι καὶ αἴσιμα ἔργʼ ἀνθρώπων. καὶ μὲν δυσμενέες καὶ ἀνάρσιοι, οἵ τʼ ἐπὶ γαίης ἀλλοτρίης βῶσιν καί σφι Ζεὺς ληΐδα δώῃ, πλησάμενοι δέ τε νῆας ἔβαν οἶκόνδε νέεσθαι, καὶ μὲν τοῖς ὄπιδος κρατερὸν δέος ἐν φρεσὶ πίπτει. οἵδε δὲ καί τι ἴσασι, θεοῦ δέ τινʼ ἔκλυον αὐδήν, κείνου λυγρὸν ὄλεθρον, ὅτʼ οὐκ ἐθέλουσι δικαίως μνᾶσθαι οὐδὲ νέεσθαι ἐπὶ σφέτερʼ, ἀλλὰ ἕκηλοι κτήματα δαρδάπτουσιν ὑπέρβιον, οὐδʼ ἔπι φειδώ. ὅσσαι γὰρ νύκτες τε καὶ ἡμέραι ἐκ Διός εἰσιν, οὔ ποθʼ ἓν ἱρεύουσʼ ἱερήϊον, οὐδὲ δύʼ οἴω· οἶνον δὲ φθινύθουσιν ὑπέρβιον ἐξαφύοντες. ἦ γάρ οἱ ζωή γʼ ἦν ἄσπετος· οὔ τινι τόσση ἀνδρῶν ἡρώων, οὔτʼ ἠπείροιο μελαίνης οὔτʼ αὐτῆς Ἰθάκης· οὐδὲ ξυνεείκοσι φωτῶν ἔστʼ ἄφενος τοσσοῦτον· ἐγὼ δέ κέ τοι καταλέξω. δώδεκʼ ἐν ἠπείρῳ ἀγέλαι· τόσα πώεα οἰῶν, τόσσα συῶν συβόσια, τόσʼ αἰπόλια πλατέʼ αἰγῶν βόσκουσι ξεῖνοί τε καὶ αὐτοῦ βώτορες ἄνδρες. ἐνθάδε δʼ αἰπόλια πλατέʼ αἰγῶν ἕνδεκα πάντα ἐσχατιῇ βόσκοντʼ, ἐπὶ δʼ ἀνέρες ἐσθλοὶ ὄρονται. τῶν αἰεί σφιν ἕκαστος ἐπʼ ἤματι μῆλον ἀγινεῖ, ζατρεφέων αἰγῶν ὅς τις φαίνηται ἄριστος. αὐτὰρ ἐγὼ σῦς τάσδε φυλάσσω τε ῥύομαί τε, καί σφι συῶν τὸν ἄριστον ἐῢ κρίνας ἀποπέμπω.
"This was his story, but Odysseus went on eating and drinking ravenously without a word, brooding his revenge. When he had eaten enough and was satisfied, the swineherd took the bowl from which he usually drank, filled it with wine, and gave it to Odysseus, who was pleased, and said as he took it in his hands, ""My friend, who was this master of yours that bought you and paid for you, so rich and so powerful as you tell me? You say he perished in the cause of King Agamemnon; tell me who he was, in case I may have met with such a person. Zeus and the other gods know, but I may be able to give you news of him, for I have traveled much."""	ὣς φάθʼ, ὁ δʼ ἐνδυκέως κρέα τʼ ἤσθιε πῖνέ τε οἶνον ἁρπαλέως ἀκέων, κακὰ δὲ μνηστῆρσι φύτευεν. αὐτὰρ ἐπεὶ δείπνησε καὶ ἤραρε θυμὸν ἐδωδῇ, καί οἱ πλησάμενος δῶκε σκύφον, ᾧ περ ἔπινεν, οἴνου ἐνίπλειον· ὁ δʼ ἐδέξατο, χαῖρε δὲ θυμῷ, καί μιν φωνήσας ἔπεα πτερόεντα προσηύδα· ὦ φίλε, τίς γάρ σε πρίατο κτεάτεσσιν ἑοῖσιν, ὧδε μάλʼ ἀφνειὸς καὶ καρτερὸς ὡς ἀγορεύεις; φῆς δʼ αὐτὸν φθίσθαι Ἀγαμέμνονος εἵνεκα τιμῆς. εἰπέ μοι, αἴ κέ ποθι γνώω τοιοῦτον ἐόντα.

"Eumaios answered, ""Old man, no traveler who comes here with news will get Odysseus’ wife and son to believe his story. Nevertheless, tramps in want of a lodging keep coming with their mouths full of lies, and not a word of truth  ; every one who finds his way to the Ithacan goes to my mistress and tells her falsehoods, whereon she takes them in, makes much of them, and asks them all manner of questions, crying all the time as women will when they have lost their husbands. And you too, old man, for a shirt and a cloak would doubtless make up a very pretty story. But the wolves and birds of prey have long since torn Odysseus to pieces, and his left him behind; or the fishes of the sea have eaten him, and his bones are lying buried deep in sand upon some foreign shore; he is dead and gone, and a bad business it is for all his friends - for me especially; go where I may I shall never find so good a master, not even if I were to go home to my mother and father where I was bred and born. I do not so much care, however, about my parents now, though I should dearly like to see them again in my own country; it is the loss of Odysseus that grieves me most; I cannot speak of him without reverence though he is here no longer, for he was very fond of me, and took such care of me that wherever he may be I shall always honor his memory."""	τὸν δʼ ἠμείβετʼ ἔπειτα συβώτης, ὄρχαμος ἀνδρῶν· ὦ γέρον, οὔ τις κεῖνον ἀνὴρ ἀλαλήμενος ἐλθὼν ἀγγέλλων πείσειε γυναῖκά τε καὶ φίλον υἱόν, ἀλλʼ ἄλλως κομιδῆς κεχρημένοι ἄνδρες ἀλῆται ψεύδοντʼ, οὐδʼ ἐθέλουσιν ἀληθέα μυθήσασθαι. ὃς δέ κʼ ἀλητεύων Ἰθάκης ἐς δῆμον ἵκηται, ἐλθὼν ἐς δέσποιναν ἐμὴν ἀπατήλια βάζει· ἡ δʼ εὖ δεξαμένη φιλέει καὶ ἕκαστα μεταλλᾷ, καί οἱ ὀδυρομένῃ βλεφάρων ἄπο δάκρυα πίπτει, ἣ θέμις ἐστὶ γυναικός, ἐπὴν πόσις ἄλλοθʼ ὄληται. αἶψά κε καὶ σύ, γεραιέ, ἔπος παρατεκτήναιο. εἴ τίς τοι χλαῖνάν τε χιτῶνά τε εἵματα δοίη. τοῦ δʼ ἤδη μέλλουσι κύνες ταχέες τʼ οἰωνοὶ ῥινὸν ἀπʼ ὀστεόφιν ἐρύσαι, ψυχὴ δὲ λέλοιπεν· ἢ τόν γʼ ἐν πόντῳ φάγον ἰχθύες, ὀστέα δʼ αὐτοῦ κεῖται ἐπʼ ἠπείρου ψαμάθῳ εἰλυμένα πολλῇ. ὣς ὁ μὲν ἔνθʼ ἀπόλωλε, φίλοισι δὲ κήδεʼ ὀπίσσω πᾶσιν, ἐμοὶ δὲ μάλιστα, τετεύχαται· οὐ γὰρ ἔτʼ ἄλλον ἤπιον ὧδε ἄνακτα κιχήσομαι, ὁππόσʼ ἐπέλθω, οὐδʼ εἴ κεν πατρὸς καὶ μητέρος αὖτις ἵκωμαι οἶκον, ὅθι πρῶτον γενόμην καί μʼ ἔτρεφον αὐτοί. οὐδέ νυ τῶν ἔτι τόσσον ὀδύρομαι, ἱέμενός περ ὀφθαλμοῖσιν ἰδέσθαι ἐὼν ἐν πατρίδι γαίῃ· ἀλλά μʼ Ὀδυσσῆος πόθος αἴνυται οἰχομένοιο. τὸν μὲν ἐγών, ὦ ξεῖνε, καὶ οὐ παρεόντʼ ὀνομάζειν αἰδέομαι· πέρι γάρ μʼ ἐφίλει καὶ κήδετο θυμῷ· ἀλλά μιν ἠθεῖον καλέω καὶ νόσφιν ἐόντα.
"""My friend,"" replied Odysseus, ""you are very positive, and very hard of belief about your master's coming home again, nevertheless I will not merely say, but will swear, that he is coming. Do not give me anything for my news till he has actually come, you may then give me a shirt and cloak of good wear if you will. I am in great want, but I will not take anything at all till then, for hateful   is the man, as hateful as Hades, who lets his poverty tempt him into lying. I swear by king Zeus, by the rites of hospitality, and by that hearth of Odysseus to which I have now come, that all will surely happen as I have said it will. Odysseus will return in this self same year; with the end of this moon and the beginning of the next he will be here to do vengeance on all those who are ill treating his wife and son."""	τὸν δʼ αὖτε προσέειπε πολύτλας δῖος Ὀδυσσεύς· ὦ φίλʼ, ἐπειδὴ πάμπαν ἀναίνεαι, οὐδʼ ἔτι φῇσθα κεῖνον ἐλεύσεσθαι, θυμὸς δέ τοι αἰὲν ἄπιστος· ἀλλʼ ἐγὼ οὐκ αὔτως μυθήσομαι, ἀλλὰ σὺν ὅρκῳ, ὡς νεῖται Ὀδυσεύς· εὐαγγέλιον δέ μοι ἔστω αὐτίκʼ, ἐπεί κεν κεῖνος ἰὼν τὰ ἃ δώμαθʼ ἵκηται· ἕσσαι με χλαῖνάν τε χιτῶνά τε, εἵματα καλά· πρὶν δέ κε, καὶ μάλα περ κεχρημένος, οὔ τι δεχοίμην. ἐχθρὸς γάρ μοι κεῖνος ὁμῶς Ἀΐδαο πύλῃσι γίγνεται, ὃς πενίῃ εἴκων ἀπατήλια βάζει. ἴστω νῦν Ζεὺς πρῶτα θεῶν, ξενίη τε τράπεζα, ἱστίη τʼ Ὀδυσῆος ἀμύμονος, ἣν ἀφικάνω· ἦ μέν τοι τάδε πάντα τελείεται ὡς ἀγορεύω. τοῦδʼ αὐτοῦ λυκάβαντος ἐλεύσεται ἐνθάδʼ Ὀδυσσεύς. τοῦ μὲν φθίνοντος μηνός, τοῦ δʼ ἱσταμένοιο, οἴκαδε νοστήσει, καὶ τίσεται ὅς τις ἐκείνου ἐνθάδʼ ἀτιμάζει ἄλοχον καὶ φαίδιμον υἱόν.
"To this you answered, O swineherd Eumaios, ""Old man, you will neither get paid for bringing good news, nor will Odysseus ever come home; drink you wine in peace, and let us talk about something else. Do not keep on reminding me of all this; it always pains me when any one speaks about my honored master. As for your oath we will let it alone, but I only wish he may come, as do Penelope, his old father Laertes , and his son Telemakhos. I am terribly unhappy too about this same boy of his; he was running up fast into manhood, and bade fare to be no worse man, face and figure, than his father, but some one, either god or man, has been unsettling his mind, so he has gone off to Pylos to try and get news of his father, and the suitors are lying in wait for him as he is coming home, in the hope of leaving the house of Arceisius without a name in Ithaca . But let us say no more about him, and leave him to be taken, or else to escape if the son of Kronos holds his hand over him to protect him. And now, old man, tell me your own story; tell me also, for I want to know, who you are and where you come from. Tell me of your town and parents, what manner of ship you came in, what crew brought you to Ithaca , and from what country they professed to come - for you cannot have come by land."""	τὸν δʼ ἀπαμειβόμενος προσέφης, Εὔμαιε συβῶτα· ὦ γέρον, οὔτʼ ἄρʼ ἐγὼν εὐαγγέλιον τόδε τίσω, οὔτʼ Ὀδυσεὺς ἔτι οἶκον ἐλεύσεται· ἀλλὰ ἕκηλος πῖνε, καὶ ἄλλα παρὲξ μεμνώμεθα, μηδέ με τούτων μίμνησκʼ· ἦ γὰρ θυμὸς ἐνὶ στήθεσσιν ἐμοῖσιν ἄχνυται, ὁππότε τις μνήσῃ κεδνοῖο ἄνακτος. ἀλλʼ ἦ τοι ὅρκον μὲν ἐάσομεν, αὐτὰρ Ὀδυσσεὺς ἔλθοι ὅπως μιν ἐγώ γʼ ἐθέλω καὶ Πηνελόπεια Λαέρτης θʼ ὁ γέρων καὶ Τηλέμαχος θεοειδής. νῦν αὖ παιδὸς ἄλαστον ὀδύρομαι, ὃν τέκʼ Ὀδυσσεύς, Τηλεμάχου· τὸν ἐπεὶ θρέψαν θεοὶ ἔρνεϊ ἶσον, καί μιν ἔφην ἔσσεσθαι ἐν ἀνδράσιν οὔ τι χέρηα πατρὸς ἑοῖο φίλοιο, δέμας καὶ εἶδος ἀγητόν, τὸν δέ τις ἀθανάτων βλάψε φρένας ἔνδον ἐΐσας ἠέ τις ἀνθρώπων· ὁ δʼ ἔβη μετὰ πατρὸς ἀκουὴν ἐς Πύλον ἠγαθέην· τὸν δὲ μνηστῆρες ἀγαυοὶ οἴκαδʼ ἰόντα λοχῶσιν, ὅπως ἀπὸ φῦλον ὄληται νώνυμον ἐξ Ἰθάκης Ἀρκεισίου ἀντιθέοιο. ἀλλʼ ἦ τοι κεῖνον μὲν ἐάσομεν, ἤ κεν ἁλώῃ ἦ κε φύγῃ καί κέν οἱ ὑπέρσχῃ χεῖρα Κρονίων. ἀλλʼ ἄγε μοι σύ, γεραιέ, τὰ σʼ αὐτοῦ κήδεʼ ἐνίσπες καί μοι τοῦτʼ ἀγόρευσον ἐτήτυμον, ὄφρʼ ἐῢ εἰδῶ· τίς πόθεν εἶς ἀνδρῶν; πόθι τοι πόλις ἠδὲ τοκῆες; ὁπποίης τʼ ἐπὶ νηὸς ἀφίκεο· πῶς δέ σε ναῦται ἤγαγον εἰς Ἰθάκην; τίνες ἔμμεναι εὐχετόωντο; οὐ μὲν γάρ τί σε πεζὸν ὀΐομαι ἐνθάδʼ ἱκέσθαι.
"And Odysseus answered, ""I will tell you all about it. If there were meat and wine enough, and we could stay here in the hut with nothing to do but to eat and drink while the others go to their work, I could easily talk on for a whole twelve months without ever finishing the story of the sorrows with which it has pleased heaven to visit me."	τὸν δʼ ἀπαμειβόμενος προσέφη πολύμητις Ὀδυσσεύς τοιγὰρ ἐγώ τοι ταῦτα μάλʼ ἀτρεκέως ἀγορεύσω. εἴη μὲν νῦν νῶϊν ἐπὶ χρόνον ἠμὲν ἐδωδὴ ἠδὲ μέθυ γλυκερὸν κλισίης ἔντοσθεν ἐοῦσι, δαίνυσθαι ἀκέοντʼ, ἄλλοι δʼ ἐπὶ ἔργον ἕποιεν· ῥηϊδίως κεν ἔπειτα καὶ εἰς ἐνιαυτὸν ἅπαντα οὔ τι διαπρήξαιμι λέγων ἐμὰ κήδεα θυμοῦ, ὅσσα γε δὴ ξύμπαντα θεῶν ἰότητι μόγησα.
"""I am by birth a Cretan; my father was a well-to-do man, who had many sons born in marriage, whereas I was the son of a slave whom he had purchased for a concubine; nevertheless, my father Castor son of Hylax (whose lineage I claim, and who was held in the highest honor in the of the Cretans for his wealth, prosperity  , and the valor of his sons) put me on the same level with my brothers who had been born in wedlock. When, however, death took him to the house of Hades, his sons divided his estate and cast lots for their shares, but to me they gave a holding and little else; nevertheless, my valor   enabled me to marry into a rich family, for I was not given to bragging, or shirking on the field of battle. It is all over now; still, if you look at the straw you can see what the ear was, for I have had trouble enough and to spare. Ares and Athena made me doughty in war; when I had picked   my men to surprise the enemy with an ambuscade I never gave death so much as a thought, but was the first to leap forward and spear all whom I could overtake. Such was I in battle, but I did not care about farm work, nor the frugal home life of those who would bring up children. My delight was in ships, fighting, javelins, and arrows - things that most men shudder to think of; but one man likes one thing and another another, and this was what I was most naturally inclined to. Before the Achaeans went to Troy , nine times was I in command of men and ships on foreign service, and I amassed much wealth. I had my pick of the spoil in the first instance, and much more was allotted to me later on."	ἐκ μὲν Κρητάων γένος εὔχομαι εὐρειάων, ἀνέρος ἀφνειοῖο πάϊς· πολλοὶ δὲ καὶ ἄλλοι υἱέες ἐν μεγάρῳ ἠμὲν τράφεν ἠδʼ ἐγένοντο γνήσιοι ἐξ ἀλόχου· ἐμὲ δʼ ὠνητὴ τέκε μήτηρ παλλακίς, ἀλλά με ἶσον ἰθαιγενέεσσιν ἐτίμα Κάστωρ Ὑλακίδης, τοῦ ἐγὼ γένος εὔχομαι εἶναι ὃς τότʼ ἐνὶ Κρήτεσσι θεὸς ὣς τίετο δήμῳ ὄλβῳ τε πλούτῳ τε καὶ υἱάσι κυδαλίμοισιν. ἀλλʼ ἦ τοι τὸν κῆρες ἔβαν θανάτοιο φέρουσαι εἰς Ἀΐδαο δόμους· τοὶ δὲ ζωὴν ἐδάσαντο παῖδες ὑπέρθυμοι καὶ ἐπὶ κλήρους ἐβάλοντο, αὐτὰρ ἐμοὶ μάλα παῦρα δόσαν καὶ οἰκίʼ ἔνειμαν. ἠγαγόμην δὲ γυναῖκα πολυκλήρων ἀνθρώπων εἵνεκʼ ἐμῆς ἀρετῆς, ἐπεὶ οὐκ ἀποφώλιος ἦα οὐδὲ φυγοπτόλεμος· νῦν δʼ ἤδη πάντα λέλοιπεν ἀλλʼ ἔμπης καλάμην γέ σʼ ὀΐομαι εἰσορόωντα γιγνώσκειν· ἦ γάρ με δύη ἔχει ἤλιθα πολλή. ἦ μὲν δὴ θάρσος μοι Ἄρης τʼ ἔδοσαν καὶ Ἀθήνη καὶ ῥηξηνορίην· ὁπότε κρίνοιμι λόχονδε ἄνδρας ἀριστῆας, κακὰ δυσμενέεσσι φυτεύων, οὔ ποτέ μοι θάνατον προτιόσσετο θυμὸς ἀγήνωρ, ἀλλὰ πολὺ πρώτιστος ἐπάλμενος ἔγχει ἕλεσκον ἀνδρῶν δυσμενέων ὅ τέ μοι εἴξειε πόδεσσιν. τοῖος ἔα ἐν πολέμῳ· ἔργον δέ μοι οὐ φίλον ἔσκεν οὐδʼ οἰκωφελίη, ἥ τε τρέφει ἀγλαὰ τέκνα, ἀλλά μοι αἰεὶ νῆες ἐπήρετμοι φίλαι ἦσαν καὶ πόλεμοι καὶ ἄκοντες ἐΰξεστοι καὶ ὀϊστοί, λυγρά, τά τʼ ἄλλοισίν γε καταριγηλὰ πέλονται. αὐτὰρ ἐμοὶ τὰ φίλʼ ἔσκε τά που θεὸς ἐν φρεσὶ θῆκεν· ἄλλος γάρ τʼ ἄλλοισιν ἀνὴρ ἐπιτέρπεται ἔργοις. πρὶν μὲν γὰρ Τροίης ἐπιβήμεναι υἷας Ἀχαιῶν εἰνάκις ἀνδράσιν ἦρξα καὶ ὠκυπόροισι νέεσσιν ἄνδρας ἐς ἀλλοδαπούς, καί μοι μάλα τύγχανε πολλά. τῶν ἐξαιρεύμην μενοεικέα, πολλὰ δʼ ὀπίσσω
"""My house grew apace and I became a great man among the Cretans, but when Zeus counseled that terrible expedition, in which so many perished, the people required me and Idomeneus to lead their ships to Troy , and there was no way out of it, for the judgment of the insisted on our doing so. There we fought for nine whole years, but in the tenth we sacked the city of Priam and sailed home again as heaven dispersed us. Then it was that Zeus devised evil against me. I spent but one month happily with my children, wife, and property, and then I conceived the idea of making a descent on Egypt , so I fitted out a fine fleet and manned it. I had nine ships, and the people flocked to fill them. For six days I and my men made feast, and I found them many victims both for sacrifice to the gods and for themselves, but on the seventh day we went on board and set sail from Crete with a fair North wind behind us though we were going down a river. Nothing went ill with any of our ships, and we had no sickness on board, but sat where we were and let the ships go as the wind and steersmen took them. On the fifth day we reached the river Aigyptos; there I stationed my ships in the river, bidding my men stay by them and keep guard over them while I sent out scouts to reconnoiter from every point of vantage."	λάγχανον· αἶψα δὲ οἶκος ὀφέλλετο, καί ῥα ἔπειτα δεινός τʼ αἰδοῖός τε μετὰ Κρήτεσσι τετύγμην. ἀλλʼ ὅτε δὴ τήν γε στυγερὴν ὁδὸν εὐρύοπα Ζεὺς ἐφράσαθʼ, ἣ πολλῶν ἀνδρῶν ὑπὸ γούνατʼ ἔλυσε, δὴ τότʼ ἔμʼ ἤνωγον καὶ ἀγακλυτὸν Ἰδομενῆα νήεσσʼ ἡγήσασθαι ἐς Ἴλιον· οὐδέ τι μῆχος ἦεν ἀνήνασθαι, χαλεπὴ δʼ ἔχε δήμου φῆμις. ἔνθα μὲν εἰνάετες πολεμίζομεν υἷες Ἀχαιῶν, τῷ δεκάτῳ δὲ πόλιν Πριάμου πέρσαντες ἔβημεν οἴκαδε σὺν νήεσσι, θεὸς δʼ ἐκέδασσεν Ἀχαιούς. αὐτὰρ ἐμοὶ δειλῷ κακὰ μήδετο μητίετα Ζεύς· μῆνα γὰρ οἶον ἔμεινα τεταρπόμενος τεκέεσσιν κουριδίῃ τʼ ἀλόχῳ καὶ κτήμασιν· αὐτὰρ ἔπειτα Αἴγυπτόνδε με θυμὸς ἀνώγει ναυτίλλεσθαι, νῆας ἐῢ στείλαντα σὺν ἀντιθέοις ἑτάροισιν. ἐννέα νῆας στεῖλα, θοῶς δʼ ἐσαγείρατο λαός. ἑξῆμαρ μὲν ἔπειτα ἐμοὶ ἐρίηρες ἑταῖροι δαίνυντʼ· αὐτὰρ ἐγὼν ἱερήϊα πολλὰ παρεῖχον θεοῖσίν τε ῥέζειν αὐτοῖσί τε δαῖτα πένεσθαι. ἑβδομάτῃ δʼ ἀναβάντες ἀπὸ Κρήτης εὐρείης ἐπλέομεν Βορέῃ ἀνέμῳ ἀκραέϊ καλῷ ῥηϊδίως, ὡς εἴ τε κατὰ ῥόον· οὐδέ τις οὖν μοι νηῶν πημάνθη, ἀλλʼ ἀσκηθέες καὶ ἄνουσοι ἥμεθα, τὰς δʼ ἄνεμός τε κυβερνῆταί τʼ ἴθυνον. πεμπταῖοι δʼ Αἴγυπτον ἐϋρρείτην ἱκόμεσθα, στῆσα δʼ ἐν Αἰγύπτῳ ποταμῷ νέας ἀμφιελίσσας. ἔνθʼ ἦ τοι μὲν ἐγὼ κελόμην ἐρίηρας ἑταίρους αὐτοῦ πὰρ νήεσσι μένειν καὶ νῆας ἔρυσθαι, ὀπτῆρας δὲ κατὰ σκοπιὰς ὤτρυνα νέεσθαι·
"""But the men in their insolence   disobeyed my orders, took to their own devices, and ravaged the land of the Egyptians, killing the men, and taking their wives and children captive. The alarm was soon carried to the city, and when they heard the war cry, the people came out at daybreak till the plain was filled with horsemen and foot soldiers and with the gleam of armor. Then Zeus spread panic among my men, and they would no longer face the enemy, for they found themselves surrounded. The Egyptians killed many of us, and took the rest alive to do forced labor for them. Zeus, however, put it in my mind to do thus - and I wish I had died then and there in Egypt instead, for there was much sorrow in store for me - I took off my helmet and shield and dropped my spear from my hand; then I went straight up to the king's chariot, clasped his knees and kissed them, whereon he spared my life, bade me get into his chariot, and took me weeping to his own home. Many made at me with their ashen spears and tried to kill me in their fury, but the king protected me, for he feared the of Zeus the protector of strangers, who punishes those who do evil."	οἱ δʼ ὕβρει εἴξαντες, ἐπισπόμενοι μένεϊ σφῷ, αἶψα μάλʼ Αἰγυπτίων ἀνδρῶν περικαλλέας ἀγροὺς πόρθεον, ἐκ δὲ γυναῖκας ἄγον καὶ νήπια τέκνα, αὐτούς τʼ ἔκτεινον· τάχα δʼ ἐς πόλιν ἵκετʼ ἀϋτή. οἱ δὲ βοῆς ἀΐοντες ἅμʼ ἠοῖ φαινομένηφιν ἦλθον· πλῆτο δὲ πᾶν πεδίον πεζῶν τε καὶ ἵππων χαλκοῦ τε στεροπῆς· ἐν δὲ Ζεὺς τερπικέραυνος φύζαν ἐμοῖς ἑτάροισι κακὴν βάλεν, οὐδέ τις ἔτλη μεῖναι ἐναντίβιον· περὶ γὰρ κακὰ πάντοθεν ἔστη. ἔνθʼ ἡμέων πολλοὺς μὲν ἀπέκτανον ὀξέϊ χαλκῷ, τοὺς δʼ ἄναγον ζωούς, σφίσιν ἐργάζεσθαι ἀνάγκῃ. αὐτὰρ ἐμοὶ Ζεὺς αὐτὸς ἐνὶ φρεσὶν ὧδε νόημα ποίησʼ—ὡς ὄφελον θανέειν καὶ πότμον ἐπισπεῖν αὐτοῦ ἐν Αἰγύπτῳ· ἔτι γάρ νύ με πῆμʼ ὑπέδεκτο— αὐτίκʼ ἀπὸ κρατὸς κυνέην εὔτυκτον ἔθηκα καὶ σάκος ὤμοιϊν, δόρυ δʼ ἔκβαλον ἔκτοσε χειρός· αὐτὰρ ἐγὼ βασιλῆος ἐναντίον ἤλυθον ἵππων καὶ κύσα γούναθʼ ἑλών· ὁδʼ ἐρύσατο καί μʼ ἐλέησεν, ἐς δίφρον δέ μʼ ἕσας ἄγεν οἴκαδε δάκρυ χέοντα. ἦ μέν μοι μάλα πολλοὶ ἐπήϊσσον μελίῃσιν, ἱέμενοι κτεῖναι—δὴ γὰρ κεχολώατο λίην— ἀλλʼ ἀπὸ κεῖνος ἔρυκε, Διὸς δʼ ὠπίζετο μῆνιν ξεινίου, ὅς τε μάλιστα νεμεσσᾶται κακὰ ἔργα.
"""I stayed there for seven years and got together much wealth among the Egyptians, for they all gave me something; but when it was now going on for eight years there came a certain Phoenician, a cunning rascal, who had already committed all sorts of villainy, and this man talked me over into going with him to Phoenicia , where his house and his possessions lay. I stayed there for a whole twelve months, but at the end of that time when months and days had gone by till the same season   had come round again, he set me on board a ship bound for Libya , on a pretense that I was to take a cargo along with him to that place, but really that he might sell me as a slave and take the wealth I fetched. I suspected his intention, but went on board with him, for I could not help it."	ἔνθα μὲν ἑπτάετες μένον αὐτόθι, πολλὰ δʼ ἄγειρα χρήματʼ ἀνʼ Αἰγυπτίους ἄνδρας· δίδοσαν γὰρ ἅπαντες. ἀλλʼ ὅτε δὴ ὄγδοόν μοι ἐπιπλόμενον ἔτος ἦλθεν, δὴ τότε Φοῖνιξ ἦλθεν ἀνὴρ ἀπατήλια εἰδώς, τρώκτης, ὃς δὴ πολλὰ κάκʼ ἀνθρώποισιν ἐώργει· ὅς μʼ ἄγε παρπεπιθὼν ᾗσι φρεσίν, ὄφρʼ ἱκόμεσθα Φοινίκην, ὅθι τοῦ γε δόμοι καὶ κτήματʼ ἔκειτο. ἔνθα παρʼ αὐτῷ μεῖνα τελεσφόρον εἰς ἐνιαυτόν. ἀλλʼ ὅτε δὴ μῆνές τε καὶ ἡμέραι ἐξετελεῦντο ἄψ περιτελλομένου ἔτεος καὶ ἐπήλυθον ὧραι, ἐς Λιβύην μʼ ἐπὶ νηὸς ἐέσσατο ποντοπόροιο ψεύδεα βουλεύσας, ἵνα οἱ σὺν φόρτον ἄγοιμι, κεῖθι δέ μʼ ὡς περάσειε καὶ ἄσπετον ὦνον ἕλοιτο. τῷ ἑπόμην ἐπὶ νηός, ὀϊόμενός περ, ἀνάγκῃ.
"""The ship ran before a fresh North wind till we had reached the sea that lies between Crete and Libya ; there, however, Zeus counseled their destruction, for as soon as we were well out from Crete and could see nothing but sea and sky, he raised a black cloud over our ship and the sea grew dark beneath it. Then Zeus let fly with his thunderbolts and the ship went round and round and was filled with fire and brimstone as the lightning struck it. The men fell all into the sea; they were carried about in the water round the ship looking like so many sea-gulls, but the god presently deprived them of all chance of homecoming   again. I was all dismayed; Zeus, however, sent the ship's mast within my reach, which saved my life, for I clung to it, and drifted before the fury of the gale. Nine days did I drift but in the darkness of the tenth night a great wave bore me on to the Thesprotian coast. There Pheidon king of the Thesprotians entertained me hospitably without charging me anything at all, for his son found me when I was nearly dead with cold and fatigue, whereon he raised me by the hand, took me to his father's house and gave me clothes to wear."	ἡ δʼ ἔθεεν Βορέῃ ἀνέμῳ ἀκραέϊ καλῷ, μέσσον ὑπὲρ Κρήτης· Ζεὺς δέ σφισι μήδετʼ ὄλεθρον. ἀλλʼ ὅτε δὴ Κρήτην μὲν ἐλείπομεν, οὐδέ τις ἄλλη φαίνετο γαιάων, ἀλλʼ οὐρανὸς ἠδὲ θάλασσα, δὴ τότε κυανέην νεφέλην ἔστησε Κρονίων νηὸς ὕπερ γλαφυρῆς, ἤχλυσε δὲ πόντος ὑπʼ αὐτῆς.

"""There it was that I heard news of Odysseus, for the king told me he had entertained him, and shown him much hospitality while he was on his homeward journey. He showed me also the treasure of gold, and wrought iron that Odysseus had got together. There was enough to keep his family for ten generations, so much had he left in the house of king Pheidon. But the king said Odysseus had gone to Dodona that he might learn Zeus’ mind from the god's high oak tree, and know whether after so long an absence he should return to the of Ithaca openly, or in secret. Moreover the king swore in my presence, making drink-offerings in his own house as he did so, that the ship was by the water side, and the crew found, that should take him to his own country. He sent me off however before Odysseus returned, for there happened to be a Thesprotian ship sailing for the wheat-growing island of Dulichium, and he told those in charge of her to be sure and take me safely to King Akastos."	ἔνθʼ Ὀδυσῆος ἐγὼ πυθόμην· κεῖνος γὰρ ἔφασκε ξεινίσαι ἠδὲ φιλῆσαι ἰόντʼ ἐς πατρίδα γαῖαν, καί μοι κτήματʼ ἔδειξεν ὅσα ξυναγείρατʼ Ὀδυσσεύς, χαλκόν τε χρυσόν τε πολύκμητόν τε σίδηρον. καί νύ ἐς δεκάτην γενεὴν ἕτερόν γʼ ἔτι βόσκοι· τόσσα οἱ ἐν μεγάροις κειμήλια κεῖτο ἄνακτος. τὸν δʼ ἐς Δωδώνην φάτο βήμεναι, ὄφρα θεοῖο ἐκ δρυὸς ὑψικόμοιο Διὸς βουλὴν ἐπακούσαι, ὅππως νοστήσειʼ Ἰθάκης ἐς πίονα δῆμον ἤδη δὴν ἀπεών, ἢ ἀμφαδὸν ἦε κρυφηδόν. ὤμοσε δὲ πρὸς ἔμʼ αὐτόν, ἀποσπένδων ἐνὶ οἴκῳ, νῆα κατειρύσθαι καὶ ἐπαρτέας ἔμμεν ἑταίρους, οἳ δή μιν πέμψουσι φίλην ἐς πατρίδα γαῖαν. ἀλλʼ ἐμὲ πρὶν ἀπέπεμψε· τύχησε γὰρ ἐρχομένη νηῦς ἀνδρῶν Θεσπρωτῶν ἐς Δουλίχιον πολύπυρον. ἔνθʼ ὅ γέ μʼ ἠνώγει πέμψαι βασιλῆϊ Ἀκάστῳ

They stripped me of the shirt and cloak that I was wearing, and gave me instead the tattered old clouts in which you now see me; then, towards nightfall, they reached the tilled lands of Ithaca , and there they bound me with a strong rope fast in the ship, while they went on shore to get supper by the sea side. But the gods soon undid my bonds for me, and having drawn my rags over my head I slid down the rudder into the sea, where I struck out and swam till I was well clear of them, and came ashore near a thick wood in which I lay concealed. They were very angry at my having escaped and went searching about for me, till at last they thought it was no further use and went back to their ship.

Then they all sit round and ask questions, both those who grieve over the king's absence, and those who rejoice at it because they can eat up his property without paying for it. For my own part I have never cared about asking anyone else since the time when I was taken in by an Aetolian, who had killed a man and come a long way till at last he reached my station, and I was very kind to him. He said he had seen Odysseus with Idomeneus among the Cretans, refitting his ships which had been damaged in a gale. He said Odysseus would return in the following summer or autumn with his men, and that he would bring back much wealth. And now you, you unfortunate old man, since a has brought you to my door, do not try to flatter me in this way with vain hopes. It is not for any such reason that I shall treat you kindly, but only out of respect for Zeus the god of hospitality, as fearing him and pitying you."""	αὐτὰρ ἐγὼ παρʼ ὕεσσιν ἀπότροπος· οὐδὲ πόλινδε ἔρχομαι, εἰ μή πού τι περίφρων Πηνελόπεια ἐλθέμεν ὀτρύνῃσιν, ὅτʼ ἀγγελίη ποθὲν ἔλθῃ. ἀλλʼ οἱ μὲν τὰ ἕκαστα παρήμενοι ἐξερέουσιν, ἠμὲν οἳ ἄχνυνται δὴν οἰχομένοιο ἄνακτος, ἠδʼ οἳ χαίρουσιν βίοτον νήποινον ἔδοντες· ἀλλʼ ἐμοὶ οὐ φίλον ἐστὶ μεταλλῆσαι καὶ ἐρέσθαι, ἐξ οὗ δή μʼ Αἰτωλὸς ἀνὴρ ἐξήπαφε μύθῳ, ὅς ῥʼ ἄνδρα κτείνας, πολλὴν ἐπὶ γαῖαν ἀληθείς, ἦλθεν ἐμὰ πρὸς δώματʼ· ἐγὼ δέ μιν ἀμφαγάπαζον. φῆ δέ μιν ἐν Κρήτεσσι παρʼ Ἰδομενῆϊ ἰδέσθαι νῆας ἀκειόμενον, τάς οἱ ξυνέαξαν ἄελλαι· καὶ φάτʼ ἐλεύσεσθαι ἢ ἐς θέρος ἢ ἐς ὀπώρην, πολλὰ χρήματʼ ἄγοντα, σὺν ἀντιθέοις ἑτάροισι. καὶ σύ, γέρον πολυπενθές, ἐπεί σέ μοι ἤγαγε δαίμων, μήτε τί μοι ψεύδεσσι χαρίζεο μήτε τι θέλγε· οὐ γὰρ τοὔνεκʼ ἐγώ σʼ αἰδέσσομαι οὐδὲ φιλήσω, ἀλλὰ Δία ξένιον δείσας αὐτόν τʼ ἐλεαίρων.
"Odysseus answered, ""I see that you are of an unbelieving mind; I have given you my oath, and yet you will not credit me; let us then make a bargain, and call all the gods in heaven to witness it. If your master comes home, give me a cloak and shirt of good wear, and send me to Dulichium where I want to go; but if he does not come as I say he will, set your men on to me, and tell them to throw me from yonder precipice, as a warning to tramps not to go about the country telling lies."""	τὸν δʼ ἀπαμειβόμενος προσέφη πολύμητις Ὀδυσσεύς ἦ μάλα τίς τοι θυμὸς ἐνὶ στήθεσσιν ἄπιστος, οἷόν σʼ οὐδʼ ὀμόσας περ ἐπήγαγον οὐδέ σε πείθω. ἀλλʼ ἄγε νῦν ῥήτρην ποιησόμεθʼ· αὐτὰρ ὄπισθε μάρτυροι ἀμφοτέροισι θεοί, τοὶ Ὄλυμπον ἔχουσιν. εἰ μέν κεν νοστήσῃ ἄναξ τεὸς ἐς τόδε δῶμα, ἕσσας με χλαῖνάν τε χιτῶνά τε εἵματα πέμψαι Δουλίχιόνδʼ ἰέναι, ὅθι μοι φίλον ἔπλετο θυμῷ· εἰ δέ κε μὴ ἔλθῃσιν ἄναξ τεὸς ὡς ἀγορεύω, δμῶας ἐπισσεύας βαλέειν μεγάλης κατὰ πέτρης, ὄφρα καὶ ἄλλος πτωχὸς ἀλεύεται ἠπεροπεύειν.
"""And famed among men would be mine "" replied Eumaios, ""both now and hereafter, if I were to kill you after receiving you into my hut and showing you hospitality. I should have to say my prayers in good earnest if I did; but it is just supper time   and I hope my men will come in directly, that we may cook something savory for supper."""	τὸν δʼ ἀπαμειβόμενος προσεφώνεε δῖος ὑφορβός· ξεῖνʼ, οὕτω γάρ κέν μοι ἐϋκλείη τʼ ἀρετή τε εἴη ἐπʼ ἀνθρώπους ἅμα τʼ αὐτίκα καὶ μετέπειτα, ὅς σʼ ἐπεὶ ἐς κλισίην ἄγαγον καὶ ξείνια δῶκα, αὖτις δὲ κτείναιμι φίλον τʼ ἀπὸ θυμὸν ἑλοίμην· πρόφρων κεν δὴ ἔπειτα Δία Κρονίωνα λιτοίμην. νῦν δʼ ὥρη δόρποιο· τάχιστά μοι ἔνδον ἑταῖροι εἶεν, ἵνʼ ἐν κλισίῃ λαρὸν τετυκοίμεθα δόρπον.
"Thus did they converse, and presently the swineherds came up with the pigs, which were then shut up for the night in their sties, and a tremendous squealing they made as they were being driven into them. But Eumaios called to his men and said, ""Bring in the best pig you have, that I may sacrifice for this stranger, and we will take toll of him ourselves. We have had trouble enough this long time feeding pigs, while others reap the fruit of our labor."""	ὣς οἱ μὲν τοιαῦτα πρὸς ἀλλήλους ἀγόρευον, ἀγχίμολον δὲ σύες τε καὶ ἀνέρες ἦλθον ὑφορβοί. τὰς μὲν ἄρα ἔρξαν κατὰ ἤθεα κοιμηθῆναι, κλαγγὴ δʼ ἄσπετος ὦρτο συῶν αὐλιζομενάων αὐτὰρ ὁ οἷς ἑτάροισιν ἐκέκλετο δῖος ὑφορβός· ἄξεθʼ ὑῶν τὸν ἄριστον, ἵνα ξείνῳ ἱερεύσω τηλεδαπῷ· πρὸς δʼ αὐτοὶ ὀνησόμεθʼ, οἵ περ ὀϊζὺν δὴν ἔχομεν πάσχοντες ὑῶν ἕνεκʼ ἀργιοδόντων· ἄλλοι δʼ ἡμέτερον κάματον νήποινον ἔδουσιν.
"On this he began chopping firewood, while the others brought in a fine fat five year old boar pig, and set it at the altar. Eumaios did not forget the gods, for he was a man of good principles, so the first thing he did was to cut bristles from the pig's face and throw them into the fire, praying to all the gods as he did so that Odysseus might return home again. Then he clubbed the pig with a billet of oak which he had kept back when he was chopping the firewood, and its left it, while the others slaughtered and singed it. Then they cut it up, and Eumaios began by putting raw pieces from each joint on to some of the fat; these he sprinkled with barley meal, and laid upon the embers; they cut the rest of the meat up small, put the pieces upon the spits and roasted them till they were done; when they had taken them off the spits they threw them on to the dresser in a heap. The swineherd, who was a most equitable man, then stood up to give every one his share. He made seven portions; one of these he set apart for Hermes the son of Maia and the nymphs, praying to them as he did so; the others he dealt out to the men man by man. He gave Odysseus some slices cut lengthways down the loin as a mark of especial honor, and Odysseus was much pleased. ""I hope, Eumaios,"" said he, ""that Zeus will be as well disposed towards you as I am, for the respect you are showing to an outcast like myself."""	ὣς ἄρα φωνήσας κέασε ξύλα νηλέϊ χαλκῷ, οἱ δʼ ὗν εἰσῆγον μάλα πίονα πενταέτηρον. τὸν μὲν ἔπειτʼ ἔστησαν ἐπʼ ἐσχάρῃ· οὐδὲ συβώτης λήθετʼ ἄρʼ ἀθανάτων· φρεσὶ γὰρ κέχρητʼ ἀγαθῇσιν· ἀλλʼ ὅγʼ ἀπαρχόμενος κεφαλῆς τρίχας ἐν πυρὶ βάλλεν ἀργιόδοντος ὑός, καὶ ἐπεύχετο πᾶσι θεοῖσιν νοστῆσαι Ὀδυσῆα πολύφρονα ὅνδε δόμονδε. κόψε δʼ ἀνασχόμενος σχίζῃ δρυός, ἣν λίπε κείων· τὸν δʼ ἔλιπε ψυχή. τοὶ δʼ ἔσφαξάν τε καὶ εὗσαν· αἶψα δέ μιν διέχευαν· ὁ δʼ ὠμοθετεῖτο συβώτης, πάντων ἀρχόμενος μελέων, ἐς πίονα δημόν, καὶ τὰ μὲν ἐν πυρὶ βάλλε, παλύνας ἀλφίτου ἀκτῇ, μίστυλλόν τʼ ἄρα τἆλλα καὶ ἀμφʼ ὀβελοῖσιν ἔπειραν, ὤπτησάν τε περιφραδέως ἐρύσαντό τε πάντα, βάλλον δʼ εἰν ἐλεοῖσιν ἀολλέα· ἂν δὲ συβώτης ἵστατο δαιτρεύσων· περὶ γὰρ φρεσὶν αἴσιμα ᾔδη. καὶ τὰ μὲν ἕπταχα πάντα διεμοιρᾶτο δαΐζων· τὴν μὲν ἴαν νύμφῃσι καὶ Ἑρμῇ, Μαιάδος υἱεῖ, θῆκεν ἐπευξάμενος, τὰς δʼ ἄλλας νεῖμεν ἑκάστῳ· νώτοισιν δʼ Ὀδυσῆα διηνεκέεσσι γέραιρεν ἀργιόδοντος ὑός, κύδαινε δὲ θυμὸν ἄνακτος· καί μιν φωνήσας προσέφη πολύμητις Ὀδυσσεύς· αἴθʼ οὕτως, Εὔμαιε, φίλος Διὶ πατρὶ γένοιο
"To this you answered, O swineherd Eumaios, ""Eat, my good fellow, and enjoy your supper, such as it is. A god grants this, and withholds that, just as he thinks right, for he can do whatever he chooses."""	ὡς ἐμοί, ὅττι τε τοῖον ἐόντʼ ἀγαθοῖσι γεραίρεις. τὸν δʼ ἀπαμειβόμενος προσέφης, Εὔμαιε συβῶτα· ἔσθιε, δαιμόνιε ξείνων, καὶ τέρπεο τοῖσδε, οἷα πάρεστι· θεὸς δὲ τὸ μὲν δώσει, τὸ δʼ ἐάσει, ὅττι κεν ᾧ θυμῷ ἐθέλῃ· δύναται γὰρ ἅπαντα.
As he spoke he cut off the first piece and offered it as a burnt sacrifice to the immortal gods; then he made them a drink-offering, put the cup in the hands of Odysseus, and sat down to his own portion. Mesaulios brought them their bread; the swineherd had bought this man on his own account from among the Taphians during his master's absence, and had paid for him with his own wealth without saying anything either to his mistress or Laertes . They then laid their hands upon the good things that were before them, and when they had had enough to eat and drink, Mesaulios took away what was left of the bread, and they all went to bed after having made a hearty supper.	ἦ ῥα καὶ ἄργματα θῦσε θεοῖς αἰειγενέτῃσι, σπείσας δʼ αἴθοπα οἶνον Ὀδυσσῆϊ πτολιπόρθῳ ἐν χείρεσσιν ἔθηκεν· ὁ δʼ ἕζετο ᾗ παρὰ μοίρῃ. σῖτον δέ σφιν ἔνειμε Μεσαύλιος, ὅν ῥα συβώτης αὐτὸς κτήσατο οἶος ἀποιχομένοιο ἄνακτος, νόσφιν δεσποίνης καὶ Λαέρταο γέροντος· πὰρ δʼ ἄρα μιν Ταφίων πρίατο κτεάτεσσιν ἑοῖσιν. οἱ δʼ ἐπʼ ὀνείαθʼ ἑτοῖμα προκείμενα χεῖρας ἴαλλον. αὐτὰρ ἐπεὶ πόσιος καὶ ἐδητύος ἐξ ἔρον ἕντο, σῖτον μέν σφιν ἀφεῖλε Μεσαύλιος, οἱ δʼ ἐπὶ κοῖτον σίτου καὶ κρειῶν κεκορημένοι ἐσσεύοντο.
"Now the night came on stormy and very dark, for there was no moon. It poured without ceasing, and the wind blew strong from the West, which is a wet quarter, so Odysseus thought he would see whether Eumaios, in the excellent care he took of him, would take off his own cloak and give it him, or make one of his men give him one. ""Listen to me,"" said he, ""Eumaios and the rest of you; when I have said a prayer I will tell you something. It is the wine that makes me talk in this way; wine will make even a wise man fall to singing; it will make him chuckle and dance and say many a word that he had better leave unspoken; still, as I have begun, I will go on. Would that I were still young and strong   as when we got up an ambuscade before Troy . Menelaos and Odysseus were the leaders, but I was in command also, for the other two would have it so. When we had come up to the wall of the city we crouched down beneath our armor and lay there under cover of the reeds and thick brush-wood that grew about the swamp. It came on to freeze with a North wind blowing; the snow fell small and fine like hoar frost, and our shields were coated thick with rime. The others had all got cloaks and shirts, and slept comfortably enough with their shields about their shoulders, but I had carelessly left my cloak behind me, not thinking that I should be too cold, and had gone off in nothing but my shirt and shield. When the night was two-thirds through and the stars had shifted their places, I nudged Odysseus who was close to me with my elbow, and he at once gave me his ear."	νὺξ δʼ ἄρʼ ἐπῆλθε κακὴ σκοτομήνιος, ὗε δʼ ἄρα Ζεὺς πάννυχος, αὐτὰρ ἄη Ζέφυρος μέγας αἰὲν ἔφυδρος. τοῖς δʼ Ὀδυσεὺς μετέειπε, συβώτεω πειρητίζων, εἴ πώς οἱ ἐκδὺς χλαῖναν πόροι, ἤ τινʼ ἑταίρων ἄλλον ἐποτρύνειεν, ἐπεί ἑο κήδετο λίην· κέκλυθι νῦν, Εὔμαιε καὶ ἄλλοι πάντες ἑταῖροι, εὐξάμενός τι ἔπος ἐρέω· οἶνος γὰρ ἀνώγει ἠλεός, ὅς τʼ ἐφέηκε πολύφρονά περ μάλʼ ἀεῖσαι καί θʼ ἁπαλὸν γελάσαι, καί τʼ ὀρχήσασθαι ἀνῆκε, καί τι ἔπος προέηκεν ὅ περ τʼ ἄρρητον ἄμεινον. ἀλλʼ ἐπεὶ οὖν τὸ πρῶτον ἀνέκραγον, οὐκ ἐπικεύσω. εἴθʼ ὣς ἡβώοιμι βίη τέ μοι ἔμπεδος εἴη, ὡς ὅθʼ ὑπὸ Τροίην λόχον ἤγομεν ἀρτύναντες. ἡγείσθην δʼ Ὀδυσεύς τε καὶ Ἀτρεΐδης Μενέλαος, τοῖσι δʼ ἅμα τρίτος ἄρχον ἐγών· αὐτοὶ γὰρ ἄνωγον. ἀλλʼ ὅτε δή ῥʼ ἱκόμεσθα ποτὶ πτόλιν αἰπύ τε τεῖχος, ἡμεῖς μὲν περὶ ἄστυ κατὰ ῥωπήϊα πυκνά, ἂν δόνακας καὶ ἕλος, ὑπὸ τεύχεσι πεπτηῶτες κείμεθα. νὺξ δʼ ἄρʼ ἐπῆλθε κακὴ Βορέαο πεσόντος, πηγυλίς· αὐτὰρ ὕπερθε χιὼν γένετʼ ἠΰτε πάχνη, ψυχρή, καὶ σακέεσσι περιτρέφετο κρύσταλλος. ἔνθʼ ἄλλοι πάντες χλαίνας ἔχον ἠδὲ χιτῶνας, εὗδον δʼ εὔκηλοι, σάκεσιν εἰλυμένοι ὤμους· αὐτὰρ ἐγὼ χλαῖναν μὲν ἰὼν ἑτάροισιν ἔλειπον ἀφραδίῃς, ἐπεὶ οὐκ ἐφάμην ῥιγωσέμεν ἔμπης, ἀλλʼ ἑπόμην σάκος οἶον ἔχων καὶ ζῶμα φαεινόν. ἀλλʼ ὅτε δὴ τρίχα νυκτὸς ἔην, μετὰ δʼ ἄστρα βεβήκει, καὶ τότʼ ἐγὼν Ὀδυσῆα προσηύδων ἐγγὺς ἐόντα ἀγκῶνι νύξας· ὁ δʼ ἄρʼ ἐμμαπέως ὑπάκουσε·

"""‘My friends,’ said he, ‘I have had a dream from heaven in my sleep.

"""On this Thoas son of Andraimon threw off his cloak and set out running to the ships, whereon I took the cloak and lay in it comfortably enough till morning. Would that I were still young and strong   as I was in those days, for then some one of you swineherds would give me a cloak both out of good will and for the respect   due to a brave warrior; but now people look down upon me because my clothes are shabby."""	ὣς ἔφατʼ, ὦρτο δʼ ἔπειτα Θόας, Ἀνδραίμονος υἱός, καρπαλίμως, ἀπὸ δὲ χλαῖναν θέτο φοινικόεσσαν, βῆ δὲ θέειν ἐπὶ νῆας· ἐγὼ δʼ ἐνὶ εἵματι κείνου κείμην ἀσπασίως, φάε δὲ χρυσόθρονος Ἠώς. ὣς νῦν ἡβώοιμι βίη τέ μοι ἔμπεδος εἴη· δοίη κέν τις χλαῖναν ἐνὶ σταθμοῖσι συφορβῶν, ἀμφότερον, φιλότητι καὶ αἰδοῖ φωτὸς ἑῆος· νῦν δέ μʼ ἀτιμάζουσι κακὰ χροῒ εἵματʼ ἔχοντα.
"And Eumaios answered, ""Old man, you have told us an excellent story  , and have said nothing so far but what is quite satisfactory; for the present, therefore, you shall want neither clothing nor anything else that a stranger in distress may reasonably expect, but tomorrow morning you have to shake your own old rags about your body again, for we have not many spare cloaks nor shirts up here, but every man has only one. When Odysseus’ son comes home again he will give you both cloak and shirt, and send you wherever you may want to go."""	τὸν δʼ ἀπαμειβόμενος προσέφης, Εὔμαιε συβῶτα· ὦ γέρον, αἶνος μέν τοι ἀμύμων, ὃν κατέλεξας, οὐδέ τί πω παρὰ μοῖραν ἔπος νηκερδὲς ἔειπες· τῷ οὔτʼ ἐσθῆτος δευήσεαι οὔτε τευ ἄλλου, ὧν ἐπέοιχʼ ἱκέτην ταλαπείριον ἀντιάσαντα, νῦν· ἀτὰρ ἠῶθέν γε τὰ σὰ ῥάκεα δνοπαλίξεις. οὐ γὰρ πολλαὶ χλαῖναι ἐπημοιβοί τε χιτῶνες ἐνθάδε ἕννυσθαι, μία δʼ οἴη φωτὶ ἑκάστῳ. αὐτὰρ ἐπὴν ἔλθῃσιν Ὀδυσσῆος φίλος υἱός, αὐτός τοι χλαῖνάν τε χιτῶνά τε εἵματα δώσει, πέμψει δʼ ὅππῃ σε κραδίη θυμός τε κελεύει.
With this he got up and made a bed for Odysseus by throwing some goatskins and sheepskins on the ground in front of the fire. Here Odysseus lay down, and Eumaios covered him over with a great heavy cloak that he kept for a change in case of extraordinarily bad weather.	ὣς εἰπὼν ἀνόρουσε, τίθει δʼ ἄρα οἱ πυρὸς ἐγγὺς εὐνήν, ἐν δʼ ὀΐων τε καὶ αἰγῶν δέρματʼ ἔβαλλεν. ἔνθʼ Ὀδυσεὺς κατέλεκτʼ· ἐπὶ δὲ χλαῖναν βάλεν αὐτῷ πυκνὴν καὶ μεγάλην, ἥ οἱ παρεκέσκετʼ ἀμοιβάς, ἕννυσθαι ὅτε τις χειμὼν ἔκπαγλος ὄροιτο.
Thus did Odysseus sleep, and the young men slept beside him. But the swineherd did not like sleeping away from his pigs, so he got ready to go and Odysseus was glad to see that he looked after his property during his master's absence. First he slung his sword over his brawny shoulders and put on a thick cloak to keep out the wind. He also took the skin of a large and well fed goat, and a javelin in case of attack from men or dogs. Thus equipped he went to his rest where the pigs were camping under an overhanging rock that gave them shelter from the North wind.	ὣς ὁ μὲν ἔνθʼ Ὀδυσεὺς κοιμήσατο, τοὶ δὲ παρʼ αὐτὸν ἄνδρες κοιμήσαντο νεηνίαι· οὐδὲ συβώτῃ ἥνδανεν αὐτόθι κοῖτος, ὑῶν ἄπο κοιμηθῆναι, ἀλλʼ ὅ γʼ ἄρʼ ἔξω ἰὼν ὡπλίζετο· χαῖρε δʼ Ὀδυσσεύς, ὅττι ῥά οἱ βιότου περικήδετο νόσφιν ἐόντος. πρῶτον μὲν ξίφος ὀξὺ περὶ στιβαροῖς βάλετʼ ὤμοις, ἀμφὶ δὲ χλαῖναν ἑέσσατʼ ἀλεξάνεμον, μάλα πυκνήν, ἂν δὲ νάκην ἕλετʼ αἰγὸς ἐϋτρεφέος μεγάλοιο, εἵλετο δʼ ὀξὺν ἄκοντα, κυνῶν ἀλκτῆρα καὶ ἀνδρῶν. βῆ δʼ ἴμεναι κείων ὅθι περ σύες ἀργιόδοντες
But Athena went to the fair city of Lacedaemon to tell Odysseus’ son that he was to return   at once. She found him and Peisistratos sleeping in the forecourt of Menelaos’ house; Peisistratos was fast asleep, but Telemakhos could get no rest all night for thinking of his unhappy father, so Athena went close up to him and said:	ἡ δʼ εἰς εὐρύχορον Λακεδαίμονα Παλλὰς Ἀθήνη ᾤχετʼ, Ὀδυσσῆος μεγαθύμου φαίδιμον υἱὸν νόστου ὑπομνήσουσα καὶ ὀτρυνέουσα νέεσθαι. εὗρε δὲ Τηλέμαχον καὶ Νέστορος ἀγλαὸν υἱὸν εὕδοντʼ ἐν προδόμῳ Μενελάου κυδαλίμοιο, ἦ τοι Νεστορίδην μαλακῷ δεδμημένον ὕπνῳ· Τηλέμαχον δʼ οὐχ ὕπνος ἔχε γλυκύς, ἀλλʼ ἐνὶ θυμῷ νύκτα διʼ ἀμβροσίην μελεδήματα πατρὸς ἔγειρεν. ἀγχοῦ δʼ ἱσταμένη προσέφη γλαυκῶπις Ἀθήνη·
"""Telemakhos, you should not remain so far away from home any longer, nor leave your property with such dangerous people in your house; they will eat up everything you have among them, and you will have been on a fool's errand. Ask Menelaos to send you home at once if you wish to find your excellent mother still there when you get back. Her father and brothers are already urging her to marry Eurymakhos, who has given her more than any of the others, and has been greatly increasing his wedding presents. I hope nothing valuable may have been taken from the house in spite of you, but you know what women are - they always want to do the best they can for the man who marries them, and never give another thought to the children of their first husband, nor to their father either when he is dead and done with. Go home, therefore, and put everything in charge of the most respectable woman servant that you have, until it shall please heaven to send you a wife of your own. Let me tell you also of another matter which you had better attend to. The chief men among the suitors are lying in wait for you in the Strait between Ithaca and Samos , and they mean to kill you before you can reach home. I do not much think they will succeed; it is more likely that some of those who are now eating up your property will find a grave themselves. Sail night and day, and keep your ship well away from the islands; the god who watches over you and protects you will send you a fair wind. As soon as you get to Ithaca send your ship and men on to the town, but yourself go straight to the swineherd who has charge your pigs; he is well disposed towards you, stay with him, therefore, for the night, and then send him to Penelope to tell her that you have got back safe from Pylos ."""

"Then she went back to Olympus ; but Telemakhos stirred Peisistratos with his heel to rouse him, and said, ""Wake up Peisistratos, and yoke the horses to the chariot, for we must set off home."""	ἡ μὲν ἄρʼ ὣς εἰποῦσʼ ἀπέβη πρὸς μακρὸν Ὄλυμπον, αὐτὰρ ὁ Νεστορίδην ἐξ ἡδέος ὕπνου ἔγειρεν λὰξ ποδὶ κινήσας, καί μιν πρὸς μῦθον ἔειπεν· ἔγρεο, Νεστορίδη Πεισίστρατε, μώνυχας ἵππους ζεῦξον ὑφʼ ἅρματʼ ἄγων, ὄφρα πρήσσωμεν ὁδοῖο.
"But Peisistratos said, ""No matter what hurry we are in we cannot drive in the dark. It will be morning soon; wait till Menelaos has brought his presents and put them in the chariot for us; and let him say good-bye to us in the usual way. So long as he lives a guest should never forget a host who has shown him kindness."""	τὸν δʼ αὖ Νεστορίδης Πεισίστρατος ἀντίον ηὔδα· Τηλέμαχʼ, οὔ πως ἔστιν ἐπειγομένους περ ὁδοῖο νύκτα διὰ δνοφερὴν ἐλάαν· τάχα δʼ ἔσσεται ἠώς. ἀλλὰ μένʼ εἰς ὅ κε δῶρα φέρων ἐπιδίφρια θήῃ ἥρως Ἀτρείδης, δουρικλειτὸς Μενέλαος, καὶ μύθοις ἀγανοῖσι παραυδήσας ἀποπέμψῃ. τοῦ γάρ τε ξεῖνος μιμνήσκεται ἤματα πάντα ἀνδρὸς ξεινοδόκου, ὅς κεν φιλότητα παράσχῃ.
"As he spoke day began to break, and Menelaos, who had already risen, leaving Helen in bed, came towards them. When Telemakhos saw him he put on his shirt as fast as he could, threw a great cloak over his shoulders, and went out to meet him. ""Menelaos,"" said he, ""let me go back now to my own country, for I want to get home  ."""	ὣς ἔφατʼ, αὐτίκα δὲ χρυσόθρονος ἤλυθεν Ἠώς. ἀγχίμολον δέ σφʼ ἦλθε βοὴν ἀγαθὸς Μενέλαος, ἀνστὰς ἐξ εὐνῆς, Ἑλένης πάρα καλλικόμοιο. τὸν δʼ ὡς οὖν ἐνόησεν Ὀδυσσῆος φίλος υἱός, σπερχόμενός ῥα χιτῶνα περὶ χροῒ σιγαλόεντα δῦνεν, καὶ μέγα φᾶρος ἐπὶ στιβαροῖς βάλετʼ ὤμοις ἥρως, βῆ δὲ θύραζε, παριστάμενος δὲ προσηύδα Τηλέμαχος, φίλος υἱὸς Ὀδυσσῆος θείοιο· Ἀτρεΐδη Μενέλαε διοτρεφές, ὄρχαμε λαῶν, ἤδη νῦν μʼ ἀπόπεμπε φίλην ἐς πατρίδα γαῖαν· ἤδη γάρ μοι θυμὸς ἐέλδεται οἴκαδʼ ἱκέσθαι.
"And Menelaos answered, ""Telemakhos, if you insist on going I will not detain you. I do not like to see a host either too fond of his guest or too rude to him. Moderation is best in all things, and not letting a man go when he wants to do so is as bad as telling him to go if he would like to stay. One should treat a guest well as long as he is in the house and speed him when he wants to leave it. Wait, then, till I can get your beautiful presents into your chariot, and till you have yourself seen them. I will tell the women to prepare a sufficient dinner for you of what there may be in the house; it will be at once more proper and cheaper for you to get your dinner before setting out on such a long journey. If, moreover, you have a fancy for making a tour in Hellas or in the Peloponnese , I will yoke my horses, and will conduct you myself through all our principal cities. No one will send us away empty handed; every one will give us something - a bronze tripod, a couple of mules, or a gold cup."""	τὸν δʼ ἠμείβετʼ ἔπειτα βοὴν ἀγαθὸς Μενέλαος· Τηλέμαχʼ, οὔ τί σʼ ἐγώ γε πολὺν χρόνον ἐνθάδʼ ἐρύξω ἱέμενον νόστοιο· νεμεσσῶμαι δὲ καὶ ἄλλῳ ἀνδρὶ ξεινοδόκῳ, ὅς κʼ ἔξοχα μὲν φιλέῃσιν, ἔξοχα δʼ ἐχθαίρῃσιν· ἀμείνω δʼ αἴσιμα πάντα. ἶσόν τοι κακόν ἐσθʼ, ὅς τʼ οὐκ ἐθέλοντα νέεσθαι ξεῖνον ἐποτρύνει καὶ ὃς ἐσσύμενον κατερύκει. χρὴ ξεῖνον παρεόντα φιλεῖν, ἐθέλοντα δὲ πέμπειν. ἀλλὰ μένʼ εἰς ὅ κε δῶρα φέρων ἐπιδίφρια θείω καλά, σὺ δʼ ὀφθαλμοῖσιν ἴδῃς, εἴπω δὲ γυναιξὶ δεῖπνον ἐνὶ μεγάροις τετυκεῖν ἅλις ἔνδον ἐόντων. ἀμφότερον, κῦδός τε καὶ ἀγλαΐη καὶ ὄνειαρ, δειπνήσαντας ἴμεν πολλὴν ἐπʼ ἀπείρονα γαῖαν. εἰ δʼ ἐθέλεις τραφθῆναι ἀνʼ Ἑλλάδα καὶ μέσον Ἄργος, ὄφρα τοι αὐτὸς ἕπωμαι, ὑποζεύξω δέ τοι ἵππους, ἄστεα δʼ ἀνθρώπων ἡγήσομαι· οὐδέ τις ἡμέας αὔτως ἀππέμψει, δώσει δέ τι ἕν γε φέρεσθαι, ἠέ τινα τριπόδων εὐχάλκων ἠὲ λεβήτων, ἠὲ δύʼ ἡμιόνους ἠὲ χρύσειον ἄλεισον.
"""Menelaos,"" replied Telemakhos, ""I want to go home at once, for when I came away I left my property without protection, and fear that while looking for my father I shall come to ruin myself, or find that something valuable has been stolen during my absence."""	τὸν δʼ αὖ Τηλέμαχος πεπνυμένος ἀντίον ηὔδα· Ἀτρεΐδη Μενέλαε διοτρεφές, ὄρχαμε λαῶν, βούλομαι ἤδη νεῖσθαι ἐφʼ ἡμέτερʼ· οὐ γὰρ ὄπισθεν οὖρον ἰὼν κατέλειπον ἐπὶ κτεάτεσσιν ἐμοῖσιν· μὴ πατέρʼ ἀντίθεον διζήμενος αὐτὸς ὄλωμαι, ἤ τί μοι ἐκ μεγάρων κειμήλιον ἐσθλὸν ὄληται.
"When Menelaos heard this he immediately told his wife and servants to prepare a sufficient dinner from what there might be in the house. At this moment Eteoneus joined him, for he lived close by and had just got up; so Menelaos told him to light the fire and cook some meat, which he at once did. Then Menelaos went down into his fragrant store room, not alone, but Helen went too, with Megapenthes. When he reached the place where the treasures of his house were kept, he selected a double cup, and told his son Megapenthes to bring also a silver mixing-bowl. Meanwhile Helen went to the chest where she kept the lovely dresses which she had made with her own hands, and took out one that was largest and most beautifully enriched with embroidery; it glittered like a star, and lay at the very bottom of the chest. Then they all came back through the house again till they got to Telemakhos, and Menelaos said, ""Telemakhos, may Zeus, the mighty husband of Hera, bring you safely home   according to your desire. I will now present you with the finest and most precious piece of plate in all my house. It is a mixing-bowl of pure silver, except the rim, which is inlaid with gold, and it is the work of Hephaistos. Phaidimos king of the Sidonians made me a present of it in the course of a visit that I paid him while I was on my return home. I should like to give it to you."""	αὐτὰρ ἐπεὶ τό γʼ ἄκουσε βοὴν ἀγαθὸς Μενέλαος, αὐτίκʼ ἄρʼ ᾗ ἀλόχῳ ἠδὲ δμῳῇσι κέλευσε δεῖπνον ἐνὶ μεγάροις τετυκεῖν ἅλις ἔνδον ἐόντων. ἀγχίμολον δέ οἱ ἦλθε Βοηθοΐδης Ἐτεωνεύς, ἀνστὰς ἐξ εὐνῆς, ἐπεὶ οὐ πολὺ ναῖεν ἀπʼ αὐτοῦ· τὸν πῦρ κῆαι ἄνωγε βοὴν ἀγαθὸς Μενέλαος ὀπτῆσαί τε κρεῶν· ὁ δʼ ἄρʼ οὐκ ἀπίθησεν ἀκούσας. αὐτὸς δʼ ἐς θάλαμον κατεβήσετο κηώεντα, οὐκ οἶος, ἅμα τῷ γʼ Ἑλένη κίε καὶ Μεγαπένθης. ἀλλʼ ὅτε δή ῥʼ ἵκανον ὅθι κειμήλια κεῖτο, Ἀτρεΐδης μὲν ἔπειτα δέπας λάβεν ἀμφικύπελλον, υἱὸν δὲ κρητῆρα φέρειν Μεγαπένθεʼ ἄνωγεν ἀργύρεον· Ἑλένη δὲ παρίστατο φωριαμοῖσιν, ἔνθʼ ἔσαν οἱ πέπλοι παμποίκιλοι, οὓς κάμεν αὐτή. τῶν ἕνʼ ἀειραμένη Ἑλένη φέρε, δῖα γυναικῶν, ὃς κάλλιστος ἔην ποικίλμασιν ἠδὲ μέγιστος, ἀστὴρ δʼ ὣς ἀπέλαμπεν· ἔκειτο δὲ νείατος ἄλλων. βὰν δʼ ἰέναι προτέρω διὰ δώματος, ἧος ἵκοντο Τηλέμαχον· τὸν δὲ προσέφη ξανθὸς Μενέλαος· Τηλέμαχʼ, ἦ τοι νόστον, ὅπως φρεσὶ σῇσι μενοινᾷς, ὥς τοι Ζεὺς τελέσειεν, ἐρίγδουπος πόσις Ἥρης. δώρων δʼ, ὅσσʼ ἐν ἐμῷ οἴκῳ κειμήλια κεῖται, δώσω ὃ κάλλιστον καὶ τιμηέστατόν ἐστι. δώσω τοι κρητῆρα τετυγμένον· ἀργύρεος δὲ ἐστὶν ἅπας, χρυσῷ δʼ ἐπὶ χείλεα κεκράανται, ἔργον δʼ Ἡφαίστοιο· πόρεν δέ ἑ Φαίδιμος ἥρως, Σιδονίων βασιλεύς, ὅθʼ ἑὸς δόμος ἀμφεκάλυψε κεῖσέ με νοστήσαντα· τεῒν δʼ ἐθέλω τόδʼ ὀπάσσαι.
With these words he placed the double cup in the hands of Telemakhos, while Megapenthes brought the beautiful mixing-bowl and set it before him. Hard by stood lovely Helen with the robe ready in her hand.	ὣς εἰπὼν ἐν χειρὶ τίθει δέπας ἀμφικύπελλον ἥρως Ἀτρεΐδης· ὁ δʼ ἄρα κρητῆρα φαεινὸν θῆκʼ αὐτοῦ προπάροιθε φέρων κρατερὸς Μεγαπένθης, ἀργύρεον· Ἑλένη δὲ παρίστατο καλλιπάρῃος πέπλον ἔχουσʼ ἐν χερσίν, ἔπος τʼ ἔφατʼ ἔκ τʼ ὀνόμαζε·
"""I too, my son,"" said she, ""have something for you as a keepsake from the hand of Helen; it is for your bride to wear upon her wedding day  . Till then, get your dear mother to keep it for you; thus may you go back rejoicing to your own country and to your home."""	δῶρόν τοι καὶ ἐγώ, τέκνον φίλε, τοῦτο δίδωμι, μνῆμʼ Ἑλένης χειρῶν, πολυηράτου ἐς γάμου ὥρην, σῇ ἀλόχῳ φορέειν· τῆος δὲ φίλῃ παρὰ μητρὶ κείσθω ἐνὶ μεγάρῳ. σὺ δέ μοι χαίρων ἀφίκοιο οἶκον ἐϋκτίμενον καὶ σὴν ἐς πατρίδα γαῖαν.
"So saying she gave the robe over to him and he received it gladly. Then Peisistratos put the presents into the chariot, and admired them all as he did so. Presently Menelaos took Telemakhos and Peisistratos into the house, and they both of them sat down to table. A maid servant brought them water in a beautiful golden ewer, and poured it into a silver basin for them to wash their hands, and she drew a clean table beside them; an upper servant brought them bread and offered them many good things of what there was in the house. Eteoneus carved the meat and gave them each their portions, while Megapenthes poured out the wine. Then they laid their hands upon the good things that were before them, but as soon as they had had enough to eat and drink Telemakhos and Peisistratos yoked the horses, and took their places in the chariot. They drove out through the inner gateway and under the echoing gatehouse of the outer court, and Menelaos came after them with a golden goblet of wine in his right hand that they might make a drink-offering before they set out. He stood in front of the horses and pledged them, saying, ""Farewell to both of you; see that you tell Nestor how I have treated you, for he was as kind to me as any father could be while we Achaeans were fighting before Troy ."""	ὣς εἰποῦσʼ ἐν χερσὶ τίθει, ὁ δʼ ἐδέξατο χαίρων. καὶ τὰ μὲν ἐς πείρινθα τίθει Πεισίστρατος ἥρως δεξάμενος, καὶ πάντα ἑῷ θηήσατο θυμῷ· τοὺς δʼ ἦγε πρὸς δῶμα κάρη ξανθὸς Μενέλαος. ἑζέσθην δʼ ἄρʼ ἔπειτα κατὰ κλισμούς τε θρόνους τε. χέρνιβα δʼ ἀμφίπολος προχόῳ ἐπέχευε φέρουσα καλῇ χρυσείῃ, ὑπὲρ ἀργυρέοιο λέβητος, νίψασθαι· παρὰ δὲ ξεστὴν ἐτάνυσσε τράπεζαν. σῖτον δʼ αἰδοίη ταμίη παρέθηκε φέρουσα· εἴδατα πόλλʼ ἐπιθεῖσα, χαριζομένη παρεόντων· πὰρ δὲ Βοηθοΐδης κρέα δαίετο καὶ νέμε μοίρας· οἰνοχόει δʼ υἱὸς Μενελάου κυδαλίμοιο. οἱ δʼ ἐπʼ ὀνείαθʼ ἑτοῖμα προκείμενα χεῖρας ἴαλλον. αὐτὰρ ἐπεὶ πόσιος καὶ ἐδητύος ἐξ ἔρον ἕντο, δὴ τότε Τηλέμαχος καὶ Νέστορος ἀγλαὸς υἱὸς ἵππους τε ζεύγνυντʼ ἀνά θʼ ἅρματα ποικίλʼ ἔβαινον, ἐκ δʼ ἔλασαν προθύροιο καὶ αἰθούσης ἐριδούπου. τοὺς δὲ μετʼ Ἀτρεΐδης ἔκιε ξανθὸς Μενέλαος, οἶνον ἔχων ἐν χειρὶ μελίφρονα δεξιτερῆφι, ἐν δέπαϊ χρυσέῳ, ὄφρα λείψαντε κιοίτην. στῆ δʼ ἵππων προπάροιθε, δεδισκόμενος δὲ προσηύδα· χαίρετον, ὦ κούρω, καὶ Νέστορι ποιμένι λαῶν εἰπεῖν· ἦ γὰρ ἐμοί γε πατὴρ ὣς ἤπιος ἦεν, ἧος ἐνὶ Τροίῃ πολεμίζομεν υἷες Ἀχαιῶν.
"""We will be sure, sir,"" answered Telemakhos, ""to tell him everything as soon as we see him. I wish I were as certain of finding Odysseus returned when I get back to Ithaca , that I might tell him of the very great kindness you have shown me and of the many beautiful presents I am taking with me."""	τὸν δʼ αὖ Τηλέμαχος πεπνυμένος ἀντίον ηὔδα· καὶ λίην κείνῳ γε, διοτρεφές, ὡς ἀγορεύεις, πάντα τάδʼ ἐλθόντες καταλέξομεν· αἲ γὰρ ἐγὼν ὣς νοστήσας Ἰθάκηνδε, κιχὼν Ὀδυσῆʼ ἐνὶ οἴκῳ, εἴποιμʼ ὡς παρὰ σεῖο τυχὼν φιλότητος ἁπάσης ἔρχομαι, αὐτὰρ ἄγω κειμήλια πολλὰ καὶ ἐσθλά.
"As he was thus speaking a bird flew on his right hand - an eagle with a great white goose in its talons which it had carried off from the farm yard - and all the men and women were running after it and shouting. It came quite close up to them and flew away on their right hands in front of the horses. When they saw it they were glad, and their hearts took comfort within them, whereon Peisistratos said, ""Tell me, Menelaos, has heaven sent this omen for us or for you?"""	ὣς ἄρα οἱ εἰπόντι ἐπέπτατο δεξιὸς ὄρνις, αἰετὸς ἀργὴν χῆνα φέρων ὀνύχεσσι πέλωρον, ἥμερον ἐξ αὐλῆς· οἱ δʼ ἰΰζοντες ἕποντο ἀνέρες ἠδὲ γυναῖκες· ὁ δέ σφισιν ἐγγύθεν ἐλθὼν δεξιὸς ἤϊξε πρόσθʼ ἵππων· οἱ δὲ ἰδόντες γήθησαν, καὶ πᾶσιν ἐνὶ φρεσὶ θυμὸς ἰάνθη. τοῖσι δὲ Νεστορίδης Πεισίστρατος ἤρχετο μύθων· φράζεο δή, Μενέλαε διοτρεφές, ὄρχαμε λαῶν, ἢ νῶϊν τόδʼ ἔφηνε θεὸς τέρας ἦε σοὶ αὐτῷ.
"Menelaos was thinking what would be the most proper answer for him to make, but Helen was too quick for him and said, ""I will read this matter as heaven has put it in my heart, and as I doubt not that it will come to pass. The eagle came from the mountain where it was bred and has its nest, and in like manner Odysseus, after having traveled far and suffered much, will return to take his revenge - if indeed he is not back already and hatching mischief for the suitors."""	ὣς φάτο, μερμήριξε δʼ ἀρηΐφιλος Μενέλαος, ὅππως οἱ κατὰ μοῖραν ὑποκρίναιτο νοήσας. τὸν δʼ Ἑλένη τανύπεπλος ὑποφθαμένη φάτο μῦθον· κλῦτέ μευ· αὐτὰρ ἐγὼ μαντεύσομαι, ὡς ἐνὶ θυμῷ ἀθάνατοι βάλλουσι καὶ ὡς τελέεσθαι ὀΐω. ὡς ὅδε χῆνʼ ἥρπαξʼ ἀτιταλλομένην ἐνὶ οἴκῳ ἐλθὼν ἐξ ὄρεος, ὅθι οἱ γενεή τε τόκος τε, ὣς Ὀδυσεὺς κακὰ πολλὰ παθὼν καὶ πόλλʼ ἐπαληθεὶς οἴκαδε νοστήσει καὶ τίσεται· ἠὲ καὶ ἤδη οἴκοι, ἀτὰρ μνηστῆρσι κακὸν πάντεσσι φυτεύει.
"""May Zeus so grant it,"" replied Telemakhos; ""if it should prove to be so, I will make vows to you as though you were a god, even when I am at home."""	τὴν δʼ αὖ Τηλέμαχος πεπνυμένος ἀντίον ηὔδα· οὕτω νῦν Ζεὺς θείη, ἐρίγδουπος πόσις Ἥρης· τῷ κέν τοι καὶ κεῖθι θεῷ ὣς εὐχετοῴμην.
As he spoke he lashed his horses and they started off at full speed through the town towards the open country. They swayed the yoke upon their necks and traveled the whole day long till the sun set and darkness was over all the land. Then they reached Pherai , where Diokles lived who was son of Ortilokhos, the son of Alpheus. There they passed the night and were treated hospitably. When the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared, they again yoked their horses and their places in the chariot. They drove out through the inner gateway and under the echoing gatehouse of the outer court. Then Peisistratos lashed his horses on and they flew forward nothing loath; ere long they came to Pylos , and then Telemakhos said:	ἦ καὶ ἐφʼ ἵπποιϊν μάστιν βάλεν· οἱ δὲ μάλʼ ὦκα ἤϊξαν πεδίονδε διὰ πτόλιος μεμαῶτες. οἱ δὲ πανημέριοι σεῖον ζυγὸν ἀμφὶς ἔχοντες. δύσετό τʼ ἠέλιος σκιόωντό τε πᾶσαι ἀγυιαί· ἐς Φηρὰς δʼ ἵκοντο Διοκλῆος ποτὶ δῶμα, υἱέος Ὀρτιλόχοιο, τὸν Ἀλφειὸς τέκε παῖδα. ἔνθα δὲ νύκτʼ ἄεσαν ὁ δὲ τοῖς πὰρ ξείνια θῆκεν. ἦμος δʼ ἠριγένεια φάνη ῥοδοδάκτυλος Ἠώς, ἵππους τε ζεύγνυντʼ ἀνά θʼ ἅρματα ποικίλʼ ἔβαινον, ἐκ δʼ ἔλασαν προθύροιο καὶ αἰθούσης ἐριδούπου· μάστιξεν δʼ ἐλάαν, τὼ δʼ οὐκ ἄκοντε πετέσθην. αἶψα δʼ ἔπειθʼ ἵκοντο Πύλου αἰπὺ πτολίεθρον· καὶ τότε Τηλέμαχος προσεφώνεε Νέστορος υἱόν·
"""Peisistratos, I hope you will promise to do what I am going to ask you. You know our fathers were old friends before us; moreover, we are both of an age, and this journey has brought us together still more closely; do not, therefore, take me past my ship, but leave me there, for if I go to your father's house he will try to keep me in the warmth of his good will towards me, and I must go home at once."""

"Peisistratos thought how he should do as he was asked, and in the end he deemed it best to turn his horses towards the ship, and put Menelaos’ beautiful presents of gold and raiment in the stern of the vessel. Then he said, ""Go on board at once and tell your men to do so also before I can reach home to tell my father. I know how obstinate he is, and am sure he will not let you go; he will come down here to fetch you, and he will not go back without you. But he will be very angry."""	ὣς φάτο, Νεστορίδης δʼ ἄρʼ ἑῷ συμφράσσατο θυμῷ, ὅππως οἱ κατὰ μοῖραν ὑποσχόμενος τελέσειεν. ὧδε δέ οἱ φρονέοντι δοάσσατο κέρδιον εἶναι· στρέψʼ ἵππους ἐπὶ νῆα θοὴν καὶ θῖνα θαλάσσης, νηῒ δʼ ἐνὶ πρύμνῃ ἐξαίνυτο κάλλιμα δῶρα, ἐσθῆτα χρυσόν τε, τά οἱ Μενέλαος ἔδωκε· καί μιν ἐποτρύνων ἔπεα πτερόεντα προσηύδα· σπουδῇ νῦν ἀνάβαινε κέλευέ τε πάντας ἑταίρους, πρὶν ἐμὲ οἴκαδʼ ἱκέσθαι ἀπαγγεῖλαί τε γέροντι. εὖ γὰρ ἐγὼ τόδε οἶδα κατὰ φρένα καὶ κατὰ θυμόν· οἷος κείνου θυμὸς ὑπέρβιος, οὔ σε μεθήσει, ἀλλʼ αὐτὸς καλέων δεῦρʼ εἴσεται, οὐδέ ἕ φημι ἂψ ἰέναι κενεόν· μάλα γὰρ κεχολώσεται ἔμπης.
"With this he drove his goodly steeds back to the city of the Pylians and soon reached his home, but Telemakhos called the men together and gave his orders. ""Now, my men,"" said he, ""get everything in order on board the ship, and let us set out home."""	ὣς ἄρα φωνήσας ἔλασεν καλλίτριχας ἵππους ἂψ Πυλίων εἰς ἄστυ, θοῶς δʼ ἄρα δώμαθʼ ἵκανε. Τηλέμαχος δʼ ἑτάροισιν ἐποτρύνων ἐκέλευσεν· ἐγκοσμεῖτε τὰ τεύχεʼ, ἑταῖροι, νηῒ μελαίνῃ, αὐτοί τʼ ἀμβαίνωμεν, ἵνα πρήσσωμεν ὁδοῖο.
Thus did he speak, and they went on board even as he had said. But as Telemakhos was thus busied, praying also and sacrificing to Athena in the ship's stern, there came to him a man from a distant , a seer  , who was fleeing from Argos because he had killed a man. He was descended from Melampos, who used to live in Pylos , the land of sheep; he was rich and owned a great house, but he was driven into exile by the great and powerful king Neleus. Neleus seized violently   his goods and held them for a whole year, during which he was a close prisoner in the house of king Phylakos, and in much distress of mind both on account of the daughter of Neleus and because he was haunted by a great sorrow   that dread Erinyes had laid upon him. In the end, however, he escaped with his life, drove the cattle from Phylake to Pylos , avenged the wrong that had been done him, and gave the daughter of Neleus to his brother. Then he left the and went to Argos , where it was ordained that he should reign over many people. There he married, established himself, and had two famous sons Antiphates and Mantios. Antiphates became father of Oikleus, and Oikleus of Amphiaraos, who was dearly loved both by Zeus and by Apollo, but he did not live to old age, for he was killed in Thebes by reason of a woman's gifts. His sons were Alkmaion and Amphilokhos. Mantios, the other son of Melampos, was father to Polypheides and Kleitos. Aurora, throned in gold, carried off Kleitos for his beauty's sake, that he might dwell among the immortals, but Apollo made Polypheides the greatest seer   in the whole world now that Amphiaraos was dead. He quarreled with his father and went to live in Hyperesia , where he remained and prophesied for all men.	ὣς ἔφαθʼ, οἱ δʼ ἄρα τοῦ μάλα μὲν κλύον ἠδʼ ἐπίθοντο, αἶψα δʼ ἄρʼ εἴσβαινον καὶ ἐπὶ κληῗσι καθῖζον. ἦ τοι ὁ μὲν τὰ πονεῖτο καὶ εὔχετο, θῦε δʼ Ἀθήνῃ νηῒ πάρα πρυμνῇ· σχεδόθεν δέ οἱ ἤλυθεν ἀνὴρ τηλεδαπός, φεύγων ἐξ Ἄργεος ἄνδρα κατακτάς, μάντις· ἀτὰρ γενεήν γε Μελάμποδος ἔκγονος ἦεν, ὃς πρὶν μέν ποτʼ ἔναιε Πύλῳ ἔνι, μητέρι μήλων, ἀφνειὸς Πυλίοισι μέγʼ ἔξοχα δώματα ναίων· δὴ τότε γʼ ἄλλων δῆμον ἀφίκετο, πατρίδα φεύγων Νηλέα τε μεγάθυμον, ἀγαυότατον ζωόντων, ὅς οἱ χρήματα πολλὰ τελεσφόρον εἰς ἐνιαυτὸν εἶχε βίῃ. ὁ δὲ τῆος ἐνὶ μεγάροις Φυλάκοιο δεσμῷ ἐν ἀργαλέῳ δέδετο, κρατέρʼ ἄλγεα πάσχων εἵνεκα Νηλῆος κούρης ἄτης τε βαρείης, τήν οἱ ἐπὶ φρεσὶ θῆκε θεὰ δασπλῆτις Ἐρινύς. ἀλλʼ ὁ μὲν ἔκφυγε κῆρα καὶ ἤλασε βοῦς ἐριμύκους ἐς Πύλον ἐκ Φυλάκης καὶ ἐτίσατο ἔργον ἀεικὲς ἀντίθεον Νηλῆα, κασιγνήτῳ δὲ γυναῖκα ἠγάγετο πρὸς δώμαθʼ. ὁ δʼ ἄλλων ἵκετο δῆμον, Ἄργος ἐς ἱππόβοτον· τόθι γάρ νύ οἱ αἴσιμον ἦεν ναιέμεναι πολλοῖσιν ἀνάσσοντʼ Ἀργείοισιν ἔνθα δʼ ἔγημε γυναῖκα καὶ ὑψερεφὲς θέτο δῶμα, γείνατο δʼ Ἀντιφάτην καὶ Μάντιον, υἷε κραταιώ.

"His son, Theoklymenos, it was who now came up to Telemakhos as he was making drink-offerings and praying in his ship. ""Friend’"" said he, ""now that I find you sacrificing in this place, I beseech you by your sacrifices themselves, and by the to whom you make them, I pray you also by your own head and by those of your followers, tell me the truth and nothing but the truth. Who and whence are you? Tell me also of your town and parents."""	τοῦ μὲν ἄρʼ υἱὸς ἐπῆλθε, Θεοκλύμενος δʼ ὄνομʼ ἦεν, ὃς τότε Τηλεμάχου πέλας ἵστατο· τὸν δʼ ἐκίχανεν σπένδοντʼ εὐχόμενόν τε θοῇ παρὰ νηῒ μελαίνῃ, καί μιν φωνήσας ἔπεα πτερόεντα προσηύδα· ὦ φίλʼ, ἐπεί σε θύοντα κιχάνω τῷδʼ ἐνὶ χώρῳ, λίσσομʼ ὑπὲρ θυέων καὶ δαίμονος, αὐτὰρ ἔπειτα σῆς τʼ αὐτοῦ κεφαλῆς καὶ ἑταίρων, οἵ τοι ἕπονται, εἰπέ μοι εἰρομένῳ νημερτέα μηδʼ ἐπικεύσῃς· τίς πόθεν εἶς ἀνδρῶν; πόθι τοι πόλις ἠδὲ τοκῆες;
"Telemakhos said, ""I will answer you quite truly. I am from Ithaca , and my father is ‘Odysseus, as surely as that he ever lived. But he has come to some miserable end. Therefore I have taken this ship and got my crew together to see if I can hear any news of him, for he has been away a long time."""	τὸν δʼ αὖ Τηλέμαχος πεπνυμένος ἀντίον ηὔδα· τοιγὰρ ἐγώ τοι, ξεῖνε, μάλʼ ἀτρεκέως ἀγορεύσω. ἐξ Ἰθάκης γένος εἰμί, πατὴρ δέ μοί ἐστιν Ὀδυσσεύς, εἴ ποτʼ ἔην· νῦν δʼ ἤδη ἀπέφθιτο λυγρῷ ὀλέθρῳ. τοὔνεκα νῦν ἑτάρους τε λαβὼν καὶ νῆα μέλαιναν ἦλθον πευσόμενος πατρὸς δὴν οἰχομένοιο.
"""I too,"" answered Theoklymenos, am an exile, for I have killed a man of my own race. He has many brothers and kinsmen in Argos , and they have great power among the Argives. I am fleeing to escape death at their hands, and am thus doomed to be a wanderer on the face of the earth. I am your suppliant; take me, therefore, on board your ship that they may not kill me, for I know they are in pursuit."""	τὸν δʼ αὖτε προσέειπε Θεοκλύμενος θεοειδής· οὕτω τοι καὶ ἐγὼν ἐκ πατρίδος, ἄνδρα κατακτὰς ἔμφυλον· πολλοὶ δὲ κασίγνητοί τε ἔται τε Ἄργος ἀνʼ ἱππόβοτον, μέγα δὲ κρατέουσιν Ἀχαιῶν. τῶν ὑπαλευάμενος θάνατον καὶ κῆρα μέλαιναν φεύγω, ἐπεί νύ μοι αἶσα κατʼ ἀνθρώπους ἀλάλησθαι. ἀλλά με νηὸς ἔφεσσαι, ἐπεί σε φυγὼν ἱκέτευσα, μή με κατακτείνωσι· διωκέμεναι γὰρ ὀΐω.
"""I will not refuse you,"" replied Telemakhos, ""if you wish to join us. Come, therefore, and in Ithaca we will treat you hospitably according to what we have."""	τὸν δʼ αὖ Τηλέμαχος πεπνυμένος ἀντίον ηὔδα· οὐ μὲν δή σʼ ἐθέλοντά γʼ ἀπώσω νηὸς ἐΐσης, ἀλλʼ ἕπευ· αὐτὰρ κεῖθι φιλήσεαι, οἷά κʼ ἔχωμεν.
On this he received Theoklymenos’ spear and laid it down on the deck of the ship. He went on board and sat in the stern, bidding Theoklymenos sit beside him; then the men let go the hawsers. Telemakhos told them to catch hold of the ropes, and they made all haste to do so. They set the mast in its socket in the cross plank, raised it and made it fast with the forestays, and they hoisted their white sails with sheets of twisted ox hide. Athena sent them a fair wind that blew fresh and strong to take the ship on her course as fast as possible. Thus then they passed by Krounoi and Khalkis .	ὣς ἄρα φωνήσας οἱ ἐδέξατο χάλκεον ἔγχος, καὶ τό γʼ ἐπʼ ἰκριόφιν τάνυσεν νεὸς ἀμφιελίσσης· ἂν δὲ καὶ αὐτὸς νηὸς ἐβήσετο ποντοπόροιο. ἐν πρύμνῃ δʼ ἄρʼ ἔπειτα καθέζετο, πὰρ δὲ οἷ αὐτῷ εἷσε Θεοκλύμενον· τοὶ δὲ πρυμνήσιʼ ἔλυσαν.

Presently the sun set and darkness was over all the land. The vessel made a quick passage to Pherai and thence on to Elis , where the Epeans rule. Telemakhos then headed her for the flying islands, wondering within himself whether he should escape death or should be taken prisoner.	δύσετό τʼ ἠέλιος σκιόωντό τε πᾶσαι ἀγυιαί· ἡ δὲ Φεὰς ἐπέβαλλεν ἐπειγομένη Διὸς οὔρῳ ἠδὲ παρʼ Ἤλιδα δῖαν, ὅθι κρατέουσιν Ἐπειοί. ἔνθεν δʼ αὖ νήσοισιν ἐπιπροέηκε θοῇσιν, ὁρμαίνων ἤ κεν θάνατον φύγοι ἦ κεν ἁλώῃ.
Meanwhile Odysseus and the swineherd were eating their supper in the hut, and the men supped with them. As soon as they had had to eat and drink, Odysseus began trying to prove the swineherd and see whether he would continue to treat him kindly, and ask him to stay on at the station or pack him off to the city; so he said:	τὼ δʼ αὖτʼ ἐν κλισίῃ Ὀδυσεὺς καὶ δῖος ὑφορβὸς δορπείτην· παρὰ δέ σφιν ἐδόρπεον ἀνέρες ἄλλοι. αὐτὰρ ἐπεὶ πόσιος καὶ ἐδητύος ἐξ ἔρον ἕντο, τοῖς δʼ Ὀδυσεὺς μετέειπε, συβώτεω πειρητίζων, ἤ μιν ἔτʼ ἐνδυκέως φιλέοι μεῖναί τε κελεύοι αὐτοῦ ἐνὶ σταθμῷ, ἦ ὀτρύνειε πόλινδε·
"""Eumaios, and all of you, tomorrow I want to go away and begin begging about the town, so as to be no more trouble to you or to your men. Give me your advice therefore, and let me have a good guide to go with me and show me the way. I will go the round of the city begging as I needs must, to see if any one will give me a drink and a piece of bread. I should like also to go to the house of Odysseus and bring news of her husband to queen Penelope. I could then go about among the suitors and see if out of all their abundance they will give me a dinner. I should soon make them an excellent servant in all sorts of ways. Listen and believe when I tell you that by the blessing of Hermes who gives grace   and good name to the works of all men, there is no one living who would make a more handy servant than I should - to put fresh wood on the fire, chop fuel, carve, cook, pour out wine, and do all those services that poor men have to do for their betters."""	κέκλυθι νῦν, Εὔμαιε, καὶ ἄλλοι πάντες ἑταῖροι· ἠῶθεν προτὶ ἄστυ λιλαίομαι ἀπονέεσθαι πτωχεύσων, ἵνα μή σε κατατρύχω καὶ ἑταίρους. ἀλλά μοι εὖ θʼ ὑπόθευ καὶ ἅμʼ ἡγεμόνʼ ἐσθλὸν ὄπασσον ὅς κέ με κεῖσʼ ἀγάγῃ· κατὰ δὲ πτόλιν αὐτὸς ἀνάγκῃ πλάγξομαι, αἴ κέν τις κοτύλην καὶ πύρνον ὀρέξῃ. καί κʼ ἐλθὼν πρὸς δώματʼ Ὀδυσσῆος θείοιο ἀγγελίην εἴποιμι περίφρονι Πηνελοπείῃ, καί κε μνηστήρεσσιν ὑπερφιάλοισι μιγείην, εἴ μοι δεῖπνον δοῖεν ὀνείατα μυρίʼ ἔχοντες. αἶψά κεν εὖ δρώοιμι μετὰ σφίσιν ἅσσʼ ἐθέλοιεν. ἐκ γάρ τοι ἐρέω, σὺ δὲ σύνθεο καί μευ ἄκουσον· Ἑρμείαο ἕκητι διακτόρου, ὅς ῥά τε πάντων ἀνθρώπων ἔργοισι χάριν καὶ κῦδος ὀπάζει, δρηστοσύνῃ οὐκ ἄν μοι ἐρίσσειε βροτὸς ἄλλος, πῦρ τʼ εὖ νηῆσαι διά τε ξύλα δανὰ κεάσσαι, δαιτρεῦσαί τε καὶ ὀπτῆσαι καὶ οἰνοχοῆσαι, οἷά τε τοῖς ἀγαθοῖσι παραδρώωσι χέρηες.
"The swineherd was very much disturbed when he heard this. ""Heaven help me,"" he exclaimed, ""what ever can have put such a notion as that into your head? If you go near the suitors you will be undone to a certainty, for their overweening pride   and violent insolence   reach the very heavens. They would never think of taking a man like you for a servant. Their servants are all young men, well dressed, wearing good cloaks and shirts, with well looking faces and their hair always tidy, the tables are kept quite clean and are loaded with bread, meat, and wine. Stay where you are, then; you are not in anybody's way; I do not mind your being here, no more do any of the others, and when Telemakhos comes home he will give you a shirt and cloak and will send you wherever you want to go."""	τὸν δὲ μέγʼ ὀχθήσας προσέφης, Εὔμαιε συβῶτα· ὤ μοι, ξεῖνε, τίη τοι ἐνὶ φρεσὶ τοῦτο νόημα ἔπλετο; ἦ σύ γε πάγχυ λιλαίεαι αὐτόθʼ ὀλέσθαι. εἰ δὴ μνηστήρων ἐθέλεις καταδῦναι ὅμιλον, τῶν ὕβρις τε βίη τε σιδήρεον οὐρανὸν ἵκει. οὔ τοι τοιοίδʼ εἰσὶν ὑποδρηστῆρες ἐκείνων, ἀλλὰ νέοι, χλαίνας εὖ εἱμένοι ἠδὲ χιτῶνας, αἰεὶ δὲ λιπαροὶ κεφαλὰς καὶ καλὰ πρόσωπα, οἵ σφιν ὑποδρώωσιν· ἐΰξεστοι δὲ τράπεζαι σίτου καὶ κρειῶν ἠδʼ οἴνου βεβρίθασιν. ἀλλὰ μένʼ· οὐ γάρ τίς τοι ἀνιᾶται παρεόντι, οὔτʼ ἐγὼ οὔτε τις ἄλλος ἑταίρων, οἵ μοι ἔασιν. αὐτὰρ ἐπὴν ἔλθῃσιν Ὀδυσσῆος φίλος υἱός, κεῖνός σε χλαῖνάν τε χιτῶνά τε εἵματα ἕσσει, πέμψει δʼ ὅππη σε κραδίη θυμός τε κελεύει.
"Odysseus answered, ""I hope you may be as dear to the gods as you are to me, for having saved me from going about and getting into trouble; there is nothing worse than being always ways on the tramp; still, when men have once got low down in the world they will go through a great deal on behalf of their miserable bellies. Since however you press me to stay here and await the return of Telemakhos, tell about Odysseus’ mother, and his father whom he left on the threshold of old age when he set out for Troy . Are they still living or are they already dead and in the house of Hades?"""	τὸν δʼ ἠμείβετʼ ἔπειτα πολύτλας δῖος Ὀδυσσεύς· αἴθʼ οὕτως, Εὔμαιε, φίλος Διὶ πατρὶ γένοιο ὡς ἐμοί, ὅττι μʼ ἔπαυσας ἄλης καὶ ὀϊζύος αἰνῆς. πλαγκτοσύνης δʼ οὐκ ἔστι κακώτερον ἄλλο βροτοῖσιν· ἀλλʼ ἕνεκʼ οὐλομένης γαστρὸς κακὰ κήδεʼ ἔχουσιν ἀνέρες, ὅν τινʼ ἵκηται ἄλη καὶ πῆμα καὶ ἄλγος. νῦν δʼ ἐπεὶ ἰσχανάᾳς μεῖναι τέ με κεῖνον ἄνωγας, εἴπʼ ἄγε μοι περὶ μητρὸς Ὀδυσσῆος θείοιο πατρός θʼ, ὃν κατέλειπεν ἰὼν ἐπὶ γήραος οὐδῷ, ἤ που ἔτι ζώουσιν ὑπʼ αὐγὰς ἠελίοιο, ἦ ἤδη τεθνᾶσι καὶ εἰν Ἀΐδαο δόμοισι.
"""I will tell you all about them,"" replied Eumaios, "" Laertes is still living and prays heaven to let him depart peacefully his own house, for he is terribly distressed about the absence of his son, and also about the death of his wife, which grieved him greatly and aged him more than anything else did. She came to an unhappy end through sorrow for her son: may no friend or neighbor who has dealt kindly by me come to such an end as she did. As long as she was still living, though she was always grieving, I used to like seeing her and asking her how she did, for she brought me up along with her daughter Ktimene, the youngest of her children; we were boy and girl together, and she made little difference between us. When, however, we both grew up, they sent Ktimene to Same and received a splendid dowry for her. As for me, my mistress gave me a good shirt and cloak with a pair of sandals for my feet, and sent me off into the country, but she was just as fond of me as ever. This is all over now. Still it has pleased heaven to prosper my work in the situation which I now hold. I have enough to eat and drink, and can find something for any respectable stranger who comes here; but there is no getting a kind word or deed out of my mistress, for the house has fallen into the hands of wicked people. Servants want sometimes to see their mistress and have a talk with her; they like to have something to eat and drink at the house, and something too to take back with them into the country. This is what will keep servants in a good humor."""	τὸν δʼ αὖτε προσέειπε συβώτης, ὄρχαμος ἀνδρῶν· τοιγὰρ ἐγώ τοι, ξεῖνε, μάλʼ ἀτρεκέως ἀγορεύσω.

"Odysseus answered, ""Then you must have been a very little fellow, Eumaios, when you were taken so far away from your home and parents. Tell me, and tell me true, was the city in which your father and mother lived sacked and pillaged, or did some enemies carry you off when you were alone tending sheep or cattle, ship you off here, and sell you for whatever your master gave them?"""	τὸν δʼ ἀπαμειβόμενος προσέφη πολύμητις Ὀδυσσεύς· ὢ πόποι, ὡς ἄρα τυτθὸς ἐών, Εὔμαιε συβῶτα, πολλὸν ἀπεπλάγχθης σῆς πατρίδος ἠδὲ τοκήων. ἀλλʼ ἄγε μοι τόδε εἰπὲ καὶ ἀτρεκέως κατάλεξον, ἠὲ διεπράθετο πτόλις ἀνδρῶν εὐρυάγυια, ᾗ ἔνι ναιετάασκε πατὴρ καὶ πότνια μήτηρ, ἦ σέ γε μουνωθέντα παρʼ οἴεσιν ἢ παρὰ βουσὶν ἄνδρες δυσμενέες νηυσὶν λάβον ἠδʼ ἐπέρασσαν τοῦδʼ ἀνδρὸς πρὸς δώμαθʼ, ὁ δʼ ἄξιον ὦνον ἔδωκε.
"""Stranger,"" replied Eumaios, ""as regards your question: sit still, make yourself comfortable, drink your wine, and listen to me. The nights are now at their longest; there is plenty of time both for sleeping and sitting up talking together; you ought not to go to bed till bed time  , too much sleep is as bad as too little; if any one of the others wishes to go to bed let him leave us and do so; he can then take my master's pigs out when he has done breakfast in the morning. We two will sit here eating and drinking in the hut, and telling one another stories about our misfortunes; for when a man has suffered much, and been buffeted about in the world, he takes pleasure in recalling the memory of sorrows that have long gone by. As regards your question, then, my tale is as follows:"	τὸν δʼ αὖτε προσέειπε συβώτης, ὄρχαμος ἀνδρῶν· ξεῖνʼ, ἐπεὶ ἂρ δὴ ταῦτά μʼ ἀνείρεαι ἠδὲ μεταλλᾷς, σιγῇ νῦν ξυνίει καὶ τέρπεο, πῖνέ τε οἶνον ἥμενος. αἵδε δὲ νύκτες ἀθέσφατοι· ἔστι μὲν εὕδειν, ἔστι δὲ τερπομένοισιν ἀκούειν· οὐδέ τί σε χρή, πρὶν ὥρη, καταλέχθαι· ἀνίη καὶ πολὺς ὕπνος. τῶν δʼ ἄλλων ὅτινα κραδίη καὶ θυμὸς ἀνώγει, εὑδέτω ἐξελθών· ἅμα δʼ ἠοῖ φαινομένηφι δειπνήσας ἅμʼ ὕεσσιν ἀνακτορίῃσιν ἑπέσθω. νῶϊ δʼ ἐνὶ κλισίῃ πίνοντέ τε δαινυμένω τε κήδεσιν ἀλλήλων τερπώμεθα λευγαλέοισι, μνωομένω· μετὰ γάρ τε καὶ ἄλγεσι τέρπεται ἀνήρ, ὅς τις δὴ μάλα πολλὰ πάθῃ καὶ πόλλʼ ἐπαληθῇ. τοῦτο δέ τοι ἐρέω ὅ μʼ ἀνείρεαι ἠδὲ μεταλλᾷς.
"""You may have heard of an island called Syra that lies over above Ortygia, where the land begins to turn round and look in another direction. It is not very thickly peopled, but the soil is good, with much pasture fit for cattle and sheep, and it abounds with wine and wheat. Dearth never comes there, nor are the people   plagued by any sickness, but when they grow old Apollo comes with Artemis and kills them with his painless shafts. It contains two communities, and the whole country is divided between these two. My father Ktesios son of Ormenus, a man comparable to the gods, reigned over both."	νῆσός τις Συρίη κικλήσκεται, εἴ που ἀκούεις, Ὀρτυγίης καθύπερθεν, ὅθι τροπαὶ ἠελίοιο, οὔ τι περιπληθὴς λίην τόσον, ἀλλʼ ἀγαθὴ μέν, εὔβοτος, εὔμηλος, οἰνοπληθής, πολύπυρος. πείνη δʼ οὔ ποτε δῆμον ἐσέρχεται, οὐδέ τις ἄλλη νοῦσος ἐπὶ στυγερὴ πέλεται δειλοῖσι βροτοῖσιν· ἀλλʼ ὅτε γηράσκωσι πόλιν κάτα φῦλʼ ἀνθρώπων, ἐλθὼν ἀργυρότοξος Ἀπόλλων Ἀρτέμιδι ξὺν οἷς ἀγανοῖς βελέεσσιν ἐποιχόμενος κατέπεφνεν. ἔνθα δύω πόλιες, δίχα δέ σφισι πάντα δέδασται· τῇσιν δʼ ἀμφοτέρῃσι πατὴρ ἐμὸς ἐμβασίλευε, Κτήσιος Ὀρμενίδης, ἐπιείκελος ἀθανάτοισιν.
"""Now to this place there came some cunning traders from Phoenicia (for the Phoenicians are great mariners) in a ship which they had freighted with trinkets of all kinds. There happened to be a Phoenician woman in my father's house, very tall and comely, and an excellent servant; these scoundrels got hold of her one day when she was washing near their ship, seduced her, and cajoled her in ways that no woman can resist, no matter how good she may be by nature. The man who had seduced her asked her who she was and where she came from, and on this she told him her father's name. ‘I come from Sidon ,’ said she, ‘and am daughter to Arybas, a man rolling in wealth. One day as I was coming into the town from the country some Taphian pirates seized me and took me here over the sea, where they sold me to the man who owns this house, and he gave them their price for me.’"	ἔνθα δὲ Φοίνικες ναυσίκλυτοι ἤλυθον ἄνδρες, τρῶκται, μυρίʼ ἄγοντες ἀθύρματα νηῒ μελαίνῃ. ἔσκε δὲ πατρὸς ἐμοῖο γυνὴ Φοίνισσʼ ἐνὶ οἴκῳ, καλή τε μεγάλη τε καὶ ἀγλαὰ ἔργα ἰδυῖα· τὴν δʼ ἄρα Φοίνικες πολυπαίπαλοι ἠπερόπευον. πλυνούσῃ τις πρῶτα μίγη κοίλῃ παρὰ νηῒ εὐνῇ καὶ φιλότητι, τά τε φρένας ἠπεροπεύει θηλυτέρῃσι γυναιξί, καὶ ἥ κʼ εὐεργὸς ἔῃσιν. εἰρώτα δὴ ἔπειτα τίς εἴη καὶ πόθεν ἔλθοι· ἡ δὲ μάλʼ αὐτίκα πατρὸς ἐπέφραδεν ὑψερεφὲς δῶ· ἐκ μὲν Σιδῶνος πολυχάλκου εὔχομαι εἶναι, κούρη δʼ εἴμʼ Ἀρύβαντος ἐγὼ ῥυδὸν ἀφνειοῖο· ἀλλά μʼ ἀνήρπαξαν Τάφιοι ληΐστορες ἄνδρες ἀγρόθεν ἐρχομένην, πέρασαν δέ τε δεῦρʼ ἀγαγόντες τοῦδʼ ἀνδρὸς πρὸς δώμαθʼ· ὁ δʼ ἄξιον ὦνον ἔδωκε.
"""The man who had seduced her then said, ‘Would you like to come along with us to see the house of your parents and your parents themselves? They are both alive and are said to be well off.’"	τὴν δʼ αὖτε προσέειπεν ἀνήρ, ὃς ἐμίσγετο λάθρη· ἦ ῥά κε νῦν πάλιν αὖτις ἅμʼ ἡμῖν οἴκαδʼ ἕποιο, ὄφρα ἴδῃ πατρὸς καὶ μητέρος ὑψερεφὲς δῶ αὐτούς τʼ; ἦ γὰρ ἔτʼ εἰσὶ καὶ ἀφνειοὶ καλέονται.

He would put me in prison, and would have all of you murdered; keep your own counsel therefore; buy your merchandise as fast as you can, and send me word when you have done loading. I will bring as much gold as I can lay my hands on, and there is something else also that I can do towards paying my fare. I am nurse to the son of the good man of the house, a funny little fellow just able to run about. I will carry him off in your ship, and you will get a great deal of wealth for him if you take him and sell him in foreign parts.’"	ὣς ἔφαθʼ, οἱ δʼ ἄρα πάντες ἐπώμνυον ὡς ἐκέλευεν. αὐτὰρ ἐπεί ῥʼ ὄμοσάν τε τελεύτησάν τε τὸν ὅρκον, τοῖς δʼ αὖτις μετέειπε γυνὴ καὶ ἀμείβετο μύθῳ· σιγῇ νῦν, μή τίς με προσαυδάτω ἐπέεσσιν ὑμετέρων ἑτάρων, ξυμβλήμενος ἢ ἐν ἀγυιῇ, ἤ που ἐπὶ κρήνῃ· μή τις ποτὶ δῶμα γέροντι ἐλθὼν ἐξείπῃ, ὁ δʼ ὀϊσάμενος καταδήσῃ δεσμῷ ἐν ἀργαλέῳ, ὑμῖν δʼ ἐπιφράσσετʼ ὄλεθρον. ἀλλʼ ἔχετʼ ἐν φρεσὶ μῦθον, ἐπείγετε δʼ ὦνον ὁδαίων. ἀλλʼ ὅτε κεν δὴ νηῦς πλείη βιότοιο γένηται, ἀγγελίη μοι ἔπειτα θοῶς ἐς δώμαθʼ ἱκέσθω· οἴσω γὰρ καὶ χρυσόν, ὅτις χʼ ὑποχείριος ἔλθῃ· καὶ δέ κεν ἄλλʼ ἐπίβαθρον ἐγὼν ἐθέλουσά γε δοίην. παῖδα γὰρ ἀνδρὸς ἑῆος ἐνὶ μεγάροις ἀτιτάλλω, κερδαλέον δὴ τοῖον, ἅμα τροχόωντα θύραζε· τόν κεν ἄγοιμʼ ἐπὶ νηός, ὁ δʼ ὑμῖν μυρίον ὦνον ἄλφοι, ὅπῃ περάσητε κατʼ ἀλλοθρόους ἀνθρώπους.
"""On this she went back to the house. The Phoenicians stayed a whole year till they had loaded their ship with much precious merchandise, and then, when they had got freight enough, they sent to tell the woman. Their messenger, a very cunning fellow, came to my father's house bringing a necklace of gold with amber beads strung among it; and while my mother and the servants had it in their hands admiring it and bargaining about it, he made a sign quietly to the woman and then went back to the ship, whereon she took me by the hand and led me out of the house. In the fore part of the house she saw the tables set with the cups of guests who had been feasting with my father, as being in attendance on him; these were now all gone to a meeting of the population   assembly, so she snatched up three cups and carried them off in the bosom of her dress, while I followed her, for I knew no better. The sun was now set, and darkness was over all the land, so we hurried on as fast as we could till we reached the harbor, where the Phoenician ship was lying. When they had got on board they sailed their ways over the sea, taking us with them, and Zeus sent then a fair wind; six days did we sail both night and day, but on the seventh day Artemis struck the woman and she fell heavily down into the ship's hold as though she were a sea gull alighting on the water; so they threw her overboard to the seals and fishes, and I was left all sorrowful and alone. Presently the winds and waves took the ship to Ithaca , where Laertes gave sundry of his chattels for me, and thus it was that ever I came to set eyes upon this country."""	ἡ μὲν ἄρʼ ὣς εἰποῦσʼ ἀπέβη πρὸς δώματα καλά, οἱ δʼ ἐνιαυτὸν ἅπαντα παρʼ ἡμῖν αὖθι μένοντες ἐν νηῒ γλαφυρῇ βίοτον πολὺν ἐμπολόωντο. ἀλλʼ ὅτε δὴ κοίλη νηῦς ἤχθετο τοῖσι νέεσθαι, καὶ τότʼ ἄρʼ ἄγγελον ἧκαν, ὃς ἀγγείλειε γυναικί. ἤλυθʼ ἀνὴρ πολύϊδρις ἐμοῦ πρὸς δώματα πατρὸς χρύσεον ὅρμον ἔχων, μετὰ δʼ ἠλέκτροισιν ἔερτο. τὸν μὲν ἄρʼ ἐν μεγάρῳ δμῳαὶ καὶ πότνια μήτηρ χερσίν τʼ ἀμφαφόωντο καὶ ὀφθαλμοῖσιν ὁρῶντο, ὦνον ὑπισχόμεναι· ὁ δὲ τῇ κατένευσε σιωπῇ. ἦ τοι ὁ καννεύσας κοίλην ἐπὶ νῆα βεβήκει, ἡ δʼ ἐμὲ χειρὸς ἑλοῦσα δόμων ἐξῆγε θύραζε. εὗρε δʼ ἐνὶ προδόμῳ ἠμὲν δέπα ἠδὲ τραπέζας ἀνδρῶν δαιτυμόνων, οἵ μευ πατέρʼ ἀμφεπένοντο. οἱ μὲν ἄρʼ ἐς θῶκον πρόμολον, δήμοιό τε φῆμιν, ἡ δʼ αἶψα τρίʼ ἄλεισα κατακρύψασʼ ὑπὸ κόλπῳ ἔκφερεν· αὐτὰρ ἐγὼν ἑπόμην ἀεσιφροσύνῃσι. δύσετό τʼ ἠέλιος, σκιόωντό τε πᾶσαι ἀγυιαί· ἡμεῖς δʼ ἐς λιμένα κλυτὸν ἤλθομεν ὦκα κιόντες, ἔνθʼ ἄρα Φοινίκων ἀνδρῶν ἦν ὠκύαλος νηῦς. οἱ μὲν ἔπειτʼ ἀναβάντες ἐπέπλεον ὑγρὰ κέλευθα, νὼ ἀναβησάμενοι· ἐπὶ δὲ Ζεὺς οὖρον ἴαλλεν. ἑξῆμαρ μὲν ὁμῶς πλέομεν νύκτας τε καὶ ἦμαρ· ἀλλʼ ὅτε δὴ ἕβδομον ἦμαρ ἐπὶ Ζεὺς θῆκε Κρονίων, τὴν μὲν ἔπειτα γυναῖκα βάλʼ Ἄρτεμις ἰοχέαιρα, ἄντλῳ δʼ ἐνδούπησε πεσοῦσʼ ὡς εἰναλίη κήξ. καὶ τὴν μὲν φώκῃσι καὶ ἰχθύσι κύρμα γενέσθαι ἔκβαλον· αὐτὰρ ἐγὼ λιπόμην ἀκαχήμενος ἦτορ· τοὺς δʼ Ἰθάκῃ ἐπέλασσε φέρων ἄνεμός τε καὶ ὕδωρ, ἔνθα με Λαέρτης πρίατο κτεάτεσσιν ἑοῖσιν. οὕτω τήνδε τε γαῖαν ἐγὼν ἴδον ὀφθαλμοῖσι.
"Odysseus answered, ""Eumaios, I have heard the story of your misfortunes with the most lively interest and pity, but Zeus has given you good as well as evil, for in spite of everything you have a good master, who sees that you always have enough to eat and drink; and you lead a good life, whereas I am still going about begging my way from city to city."""	τὸν δʼ αὖ διογενὴς Ὀδυσεὺς ἠμείβετο μύθῳ· Εὔμαιʼ, ἦ μάλα δή μοι ἐνὶ φρεσὶ θυμὸν ὄρινας ταῦτα ἕκαστα λέγων, ὅσα δὴ πάθες ἄλγεα θυμῷ. ἀλλʼ ἦ τοι σοὶ μὲν παρὰ καὶ κακῷ ἐσθλὸν ἔθηκε Ζεύς, ἐπεὶ ἀνδρὸς δώματʼ ἀφίκεο πολλὰ μογήσας ἠπίου, ὃς δή τοι παρέχει βρῶσίν τε πόσιν τε ἐνδυκέως, ζώεις δʼ ἀγαθὸν βίον· αὐτὰρ ἐγώ γε πολλὰ βροτῶν ἐπὶ ἄστεʼ ἀλώμενος ἐνθάδʼ ἱκάνω.
"Thus did they converse, and they had only a very little time left for sleep, for it was soon daybreak. In the meantime Telemakhos and his crew were nearing land, so they loosed the sails, took down the mast, and rowed the ship into the harbor. They cast out their mooring stones and made fast the hawsers; they then got out upon the sea shore, mixed their wine, and got dinner ready. As soon as they had had enough to eat and drink Telemakhos said, ""Take the ship on to the town, but leave me here, for I want to look after the herdsmen on one of my farms. In the evening, when I have seen all I want, I will come down to the city, and tomorrow morning in return for your trouble I will give you all a good dinner with meat and wine."""	ὣς οἱ μὲν τοιαῦτα πρὸς ἀλλήλους ἀγόρευον, καδδραθέτην δʼ οὐ πολλὸν ἐπὶ χρόνον, ἀλλὰ μίνυνθα· αἶψα γὰρ Ἠὼς ἦλθεν ἐΰθρονος. οἱ δʼ ἐπὶ χέρσου Τηλεμάχου ἕταροι λύον ἱστία, κὰδ δʼ ἕλον ἱστὸν καρπαλίμως, τὴν δʼ εἰς ὅρμον προέρυσσαν ἐρετμοῖς· ἐκ δʼ εὐνὰς ἔβαλον, κατὰ δὲ πρυμνήσιʼ ἔδησαν· ἐκ δὲ καὶ αὐτοὶ βαῖνον ἐπὶ ῥηγμῖνι θαλάσσης, δεῖπνόν τʼ ἐντύνοντο κερῶντό τε αἴθοπα οἶνον. αὐτὰρ ἐπεὶ πόσιος καὶ ἐδητύος ἐξ ἔρον ἕντο, τοῖσι δὲ Τηλέμαχος πεπνυμένος ἤρχετο μύθων· ὑμεῖς μὲν νῦν ἄστυδʼ ἐλαύνετε νῆα μέλαιναν, αὐτὰρ ἐγὼν ἀγροὺς ἐπιείσομαι ἠδὲ βοτῆρας· ἑσπέριος δʼ εἰς ἄστυ ἰδὼν ἐμὰ ἔργα κάτειμι. ἠῶθεν δέ κεν ὔμμιν ὁδοιπόριον παραθείμην, δαῖτʼ ἀγαθὴν κρειῶν τε καὶ οἴνου ἡδυπότοιο.
"Then Theoklymenos said, ‘And what, my dear young friend, is to become of me? To whose house, among all your chief men, am I to repair? Or shall I go straight to your own house and to your mother?"""	τὸν δʼ αὖτε προσέειπε Θεοκλύμενος θεοειδής· πῆ γὰρ ἐγώ, φίλε τέκνον, ἴω; τεῦ δώμαθʼ ἵκωμαι ἀνδρῶν οἳ κραναὴν Ἰθάκην κάτα κοιρανέουσιν; ἦ ἰθὺς σῆς μητρὸς ἴω καὶ σοῖο δόμοιο;
"""At any other time,"" replied Telemakhos, ""I should have bidden you go to my own house, for you would find no want of hospitality; at the present moment, however, you would not be comfortable there, for I shall be away, and my mother will not see you; she does not often show herself even to the suitors, but sits at her loom weaving in an upper chamber, out of their way; but I can tell you a man whose house you can go to - I mean Eurymakhos the son of Polybos, who is held in the highest estimation by every one in Ithaca . He is much the best man and the most persistent wooer, of all those who are paying court to my mother and trying to take Odysseus’ place. Zeus, however, in heaven alone knows whether or not they will come to a bad end before the marriage takes place."""	τὸν δʼ αὖ Τηλέμαχος πεπνυμένος ἀντίον ηὔδα· ἄλλως μέν σʼ ἂν ἐγώ γε καὶ ἡμέτερόνδε κελοίμην ἔρχεσθʼ· οὐ γάρ τι ξενίων ποθή· ἀλλὰ σοὶ αὐτῷ χεῖρον, ἐπεί τοι ἐγὼ μὲν ἀπέσσομαι, οὐδέ σε μήτηρ ὄψεται· οὐ μὲν γάρ τι θαμὰ μνηστῆρσʼ ἐνὶ οἴκῳ φαίνεται, ἀλλʼ ἀπὸ τῶν ὑπερωΐῳ ἱστὸν ὑφαίνει. ἀλλά τοι ἄλλον φῶτα πιφαύσκομαι ὅν κεν ἵκοιο, Εὐρύμαχον, Πολύβοιο δαΐφρονος ἀγλαὸν υἱόν, τὸν νῦν ἶσα θεῷ Ἰθακήσιοι εἰσορόωσι· καὶ γὰρ πολλὸν ἄριστος ἀνὴρ μέμονέν τε μάλιστα μητέρʼ ἐμὴν γαμέειν καὶ Ὀδυσσῆος γέρας ἕξειν. ἀλλὰ τά γε Ζεὺς οἶδεν Ὀλύμπιος, αἰθέρι ναίων, εἴ κέ σφι πρὸ γάμοιο τελευτήσει κακὸν ἦμαρ.
"As he was speaking a bird flew by upon his right hand - a hawk, Apollo's messenger. It held a dove in its talons, and the feathers, as it tore them off, fell to the ground midway between Telemakhos and the ship. On this Theoklymenos called him apart and caught him by the hand. ""Telemakhos,"" said he, ""that bird did not fly on your right hand without having been sent there by some god. As soon as I saw it I knew it was an omen; it means that you will remain powerful and that there will be no house in the of Ithaca more royal than your own."""	ὣς ἄρα οἱ εἰπόντι ἐπέπτατο δεξιὸς ὄρνις, κίρκος, Ἀπόλλωνος ταχὺς ἄγγελος· ἐν δὲ πόδεσσι τίλλε πέλειαν ἔχων, κατὰ δὲ πτερὰ χεῦεν ἔραζε μεσσηγὺς νηός τε καὶ αὐτοῦ Τηλεμάχοιο. τὸν δὲ Θεοκλύμενος ἑτάρων ἀπονόσφι καλέσσας ἔν τʼ ἄρα οἱ φῦ χειρὶ ἔπος τʼ ἔφατʼ ἔκ τʼ ὀνόμαζε· Τηλέμαχʼ, οὔ τοι ἄνευ θεοῦ ἔπτατο δεξιὸς ὄρνις ἔγνων γάρ μιν ἐσάντα ἰδὼν οἰωνὸν ἐόντα. ὑμετέρου δʼ οὐκ ἔστι γένος βασιλεύτερον ἄλλο ἐν δήμῳ Ἰθάκης, ἀλλʼ ὑμεῖς καρτεροὶ αἰεί.
"""I wish it may prove so,"" answered Telemakhos. ""If it does, I will show you so much good will and give you so many presents that all who meet you will congratulate you."""	τὸν δʼ αὖ Τηλέμαχος πεπνυμένος ἀντίον ηὔδα· αἲ γὰρ τοῦτο, ξεῖνε, ἔπος τετελεσμένον εἴη· τῷ κε τάχα γνοίης φιλότητά τε πολλά τε δῶρα ἐξ ἐμεῦ, ὡς ἄν τίς σε συναντόμενος μακαρίζοι.
"Then he said to his friend Peiraios, ""Peiraios, son of Klytios, you have throughout shown yourself the most willing to serve me of all those who have accompanied me to Pylos ; I wish you would take this stranger to your own house and entertain him hospitably till I can come for him."""	ἦ καὶ Πείραιον προσεφώνεε, πιστὸν ἑταῖρον· Πείραιε Κλυτίδη, σὺ δέ μοι τά περ ἄλλα μάλιστα πείθῃ ἐμῶν ἑτάρων, οἵ μοι Πύλον εἰς ἅμʼ ἕποντο· καὶ νῦν μοι τὸν ξεῖνον ἄγων ἐν δώμασι σοῖσιν ἐνδυκέως φιλέειν καὶ τιέμεν, εἰς ὅ κεν ἔλθω.
"And Peiraios answered, ""Telemakhos, you may stay away as long as you please, but I will look after him for you, and he shall find no lack of hospitality."""	τὸν δʼ αὖ Πείραιος δουρικλυτὸς ἀντίον ηὔδα· Τηλέμαχʼ, εἰ γάρ κεν σὺ πολὺν χρόνον ἐνθάδε μίμνοι, τόνδε τʼ ἐγὼ κομιῶ, ξενίων δέ οἱ οὐ ποθὴ ἔσται.
As he spoke he went on board, and bade the others do so also and loose the hawsers, so they took their places in the ship. But Telemakhos bound on his sandals, and took a long and doughty spear with a head of sharpened bronze from the deck of the ship. Then they loosed the hawsers, thrust the ship off from land, and made on towards the city as they had been told to do, while Telemakhos strode on as fast as he could, till he reached the homestead where his countless herds of swine were feeding, and where dwelt the excellent swineherd, who was so devoted a servant to his master.	ὣς εἰπὼν ἐπὶ νηὸς ἔβη, ἐκέλευσε δʼ ἑταίρους αὐτούς τʼ ἀμβαίνειν ἀνά τε πρυμνήσια λῦσαι. οἱ δʼ αἶψʼ εἴσβαινον καὶ ἐπὶ κληῗσι καθῖζον. Τηλέμαχος δʼ ὑπὸ ποσσὶν ἐδήσατο καλὰ πέδιλα, εἵλετο δʼ ἄλκιμον ἔγχος, ἀκαχμένον ὀξέϊ χαλκῷ, νηὸς ἀπʼ ἰκριόφιν· τοὶ δὲ πρυμνήσιʼ ἔλυσαν. οἱ μὲν ἀνώσαντες πλέον ἐς πόλιν, ὡς ἐκέλευσε Τηλέμαχος, φίλος υἱὸς Ὀδυσσῆος θείοιο· τὸν δʼ ὦκα προβιβάντα πόδες φέρον, ὄφρʼ ἵκετʼ αὐλήν, ἔνθα οἱ ἦσαν ὕες μάλα μυρίαι, ᾗσι συβώτης
Meanwhile Odysseus and the swineherd had lit a fire in the hut and were getting breakfast ready at daybreak for they had sent the men out with the pigs. When Telemakhos came up, the dogs did not bark, but fawned upon him, so Odysseus, hearing the sound of feet and noticing that the dogs did not bark, said to Eumaios:	τὼ δʼ αὖτʼ ἐν κλισίῃ Ὀδυσεὺς καὶ δῖος ὑφορβὸς ἐντύνοντο ἄριστον ἅμʼ ἠοῖ, κηαμένω πῦρ, ἔκπεμψάν τε νομῆας ἅμʼ ἀγρομένοισι σύεσσι· Τηλέμαχον δὲ περίσσαινον κύνες ὑλακόμωροι, οὐδʼ ὕλαον προσιόντα. νόησε δὲ δῖος Ὀδυσσεὺς σαίνοντάς τε κύνας, περί τε κτύπος ἦλθε ποδοῖϊν. αἶψα δʼ ἄρʼ Εὔμαιον ἔπεα πτερόεντα προσηύδα·
"""Eumaios, I hear footsteps; I suppose one of your men or some one of your acquaintance is coming here, for the dogs are fawning upon him and not barking."""	Εὔμαιʼ, ἦ μάλα τίς τοι ἐλεύσεται ἐνθάδʼ ἑταῖρος ἢ καὶ γνώριμος ἄλλος, ἐπεὶ κύνες οὐχ ὑλάουσιν, ἀλλὰ περισσαίνουσι· ποδῶν δʼ ὑπὸ δοῦπον ἀκούω.
The words were hardly out of his mouth before his son stood at the door. Eumaios sprang to his feet, and the bowls in which he was mixing wine fell from his hands, as he made towards his master. He kissed his head and both his beautiful eyes, and wept for joy. A father could not be more delighted at the return of an only son, the child of his old age, after ten years’ absence in a foreign country and after having gone through much hardship. He embraced him, kissed him all over as though he had come back from the dead, and spoke fondly to him saying:	οὔ πω πᾶν εἴρητο ἔπος, ὅτε οἱ φίλος υἱὸς ἔστη ἐνὶ προθύροισι. ταφὼν δʼ ἀνόρουσε συβώτης, ἐκ δʼ ἄρα οἱ χειρῶν πέσον ἄγγεα, τοῖς ἐπονεῖτο, κιρνὰς αἴθοπα οἶνον. ὁ δʼ ἀντίος ἦλθεν ἄνακτος, κύσσε δέ μιν κεφαλήν τε καὶ ἄμφω φάεα καλὰ χεῖράς τʼ ἀμφοτέρας· θαλερὸν δέ οἱ ἔκπεσε δάκρυ. ὡς δὲ πατὴρ ὃν παῖδα φίλα φρονέων ἀγαπάζῃ ἐλθόντʼ ἐξ ἀπίης γαίης δεκάτῳ ἐνιαυτῷ, μοῦνον τηλύγετον, τῷ ἔπʼ ἄλγεα πολλὰ μογήσῃ, ὣς τότε Τηλέμαχον θεοειδέα δῖος ὑφορβὸς πάντα κύσεν περιφύς, ὡς ἐκ θανάτοιο φυγόντα· καί ῥʼ ὀλοφυρόμενος ἔπεα πτερόεντα προσηύδα·
"""So you are come, Telemakhos, light of my eyes that you are. When I heard you had gone to Pylos I made sure I was never going to see you any more. Come in, my dear child, and sit down, that I may have a good look at you now you are home again; it is not very often you come into the country to see us herdsmen; you stick pretty close to the town generally. I suppose you think it better to keep an eye on what the suitors are doing."""	ἦλθες, Τηλέμαχε, γλυκερὸν φάος. οὔ σʼ ἔτʼ ἐγώ γε ὄψεσθαι ἐφάμην, ἐπεὶ ᾤχεο νηῒ Πύλονδε. ἀλλʼ ἄγε νῦν εἴσελθε, φίλον τέκος, ὄφρα σε θυμῷ τέρψομαι εἰσορόων νέον ἄλλοθεν ἔνδον ἐόντα. οὐ μὲν γάρ τι θάμʼ ἀγρὸν ἐπέρχεαι οὐδὲ νομῆας, ἀλλʼ ἐπιδημεύεις· ὣς γάρ νύ τοι εὔαδε θυμῷ, ἀνδρῶν μνηστήρων ἐσορᾶν ἀΐδηλον ὅμιλον.
"""So be it, old friend,"" answered Telemakhos, ""but I am come now because I want to see you, and to learn whether my mother is still at her old home or whether some one else has married her, so that the bed of Odysseus is without bedding and covered with cobwebs."""	τὸν δʼ αὖ Τηλέμαχος πεπνυμένος ἀντίον ηὔδα· ἔσσεται οὕτως, ἄττα· σέθεν δʼ ἕνεκʼ ἐνθάδʼ ἱκάνω, ὄφρα σέ τʼ ὀφθαλμοῖσιν ἴδω καὶ μῦθον ἀκούσω, ἤ μοι ἔτʼ ἐν μεγάροις μήτηρ μένει, ἦέ τις ἤδη ἀνδρῶν ἄλλος ἔγημεν, Ὀδυσσῆος δέ που εὐνὴ χήτει ἐνευναίων κάκʼ ἀράχνια κεῖται ἔχουσα.
"""She is still at the house,"" replied Eumaios, ""grieving and breaking her heart, and doing nothing but weep, both night and day continually."""	τὸν δʼ αὖτε προσέειπε συβώτης, ὄρχαμος ἀνδρῶν· καὶ λίην κείνη γε μένει τετληότι θυμῷ σοῖσιν ἐνὶ μεγάροισιν· ὀϊζυραὶ δέ οἱ αἰεὶ φθίνουσιν νύκτες τε καὶ ἤματα δάκρυ χεούσῃ.
"As spoke he took Telemakhos’ spear, whereon he crossed the stone threshold and came inside. Odysseus rose from his seat to give him place as he entered, but Telemakhos checked him; ""Sit down, stranger."" said he, ""I can easily find another seat, and there is one here who will lay it for me."""	ὣς ἄρα φωνήσας οἱ ἐδέξατο χάλκεον ἔγχος· αὐτὰρ ὅ γʼ εἴσω ἴεν καὶ ὑπέρβη λάϊνον οὐδόν. τῷ δʼ ἕδρης ἐπιόντι πατὴρ ὑπόειξεν Ὀδυσσεύς· Τηλέμαχος δʼ ἑτέρωθεν ἐρήτυε φώνησέν τε· ἧσʼ, ὦ ξεῖνʼ· ἡμεῖς δὲ καὶ ἄλλοθι δήομεν ἕδρην σταθμῷ ἐν ἡμετέρῳ· πάρα δʼ ἀνὴρ ὃς καταθήσει.
"Odysseus went back to his own place, and Eumaios strewed some green brushwood on the floor and threw a sheepskin on top of it for Telemakhos to sit upon. Then the swineherd brought them platters of cold meat, the remains from what they had eaten the day before, and he filled the bread baskets with bread as fast as he could. He mixed wine also in bowls of ivy-wood, and took his seat facing Odysseus. Then they laid their hands on the good things that were before them, and as soon as they had had enough to eat and drink Telemakhos said to Eumaios, ""Old friend, where does this stranger come from? How did his crew bring him to Ithaca , and who were they?-for assuredly he did not come here by land""’"	ὣς φάθʼ, ὁ δʼ αὖτις ἰὼν κατʼ ἄρʼ ἕζετο· τῷ δὲ συβώτης. χεῦεν ὕπο χλωρὰς ῥῶπας καὶ κῶας ὕπερθεν· ἔνθα καθέζετʼ ἔπειτα Ὀδυσσῆος φίλος υἱός. τοῖσιν δʼ αὖ κρειῶν πίνακας παρέθηκε συβώτης ὀπταλέων, ἅ ῥα τῇ προτέρῃ ὑπέλειπον ἔδοντες, σῖτον δʼ ἐσσυμένως παρενήνεεν ἐν κανέοισιν, ἐν δʼ ἄρα κισσυβίῳ κίρνη μελιηδέα οἶνον· αὐτὸς δʼ ἀντίον ἷζεν Ὀδυσσῆος θείοιο. οἱ δʼ ἐπʼ ὀνείαθʼ ἑτοῖμα προκείμενα χεῖρας ἴαλλον. αὐτὰρ ἐπεὶ πόσιος καὶ ἐδητύος ἐξ ἔρον ἕντο, δὴ τότε Τηλέμαχος προσεφώνεε δῖον ὑφορβόν· ἄττα, πόθεν τοι ξεῖνος ὅδʼ ἵκετο; πῶς δέ ἑ ναῦται ἤγαγον εἰς Ἰθάκην; τίνες ἔμμεναι εὐχετόωντο; οὐ μὲν γάρ τί ἑ πεζὸν ὀΐομαι ἐνθάδʼ ἱκέσθαι.
"To this you answered, O swineherd Eumaios, ""My son, I will tell you the real truth  . He says he is a Cretan, and that he has been a great traveler. At this moment he is running away from a Thesprotian ship, and has refuge at my station, so I will put him into your hands.

"""I am very much distressed,"" said Telemakhos, ""by what you have just told me. How can I take this stranger into my house? I am as yet young, and am not strong enough to hold my own if any man attacks me. My mother cannot make up her mind whether to stay where she is and look after the house out of respect for public   opinion and the memory of her husband, or whether the time is now come for her to take the best man of those who are wooing her, and the one who will make her the most advantageous offer; still, as the stranger has come to your station I will find him a cloak and shirt of good wear, with a sword and sandals, and will send him wherever he wants to go. Or if you like you can keep him here at the station, and I will send him clothes and food that he may be no burden on you and on your men; but I will not have him go near the suitors, for they are very insolent  , and are sure to ill-treat him in a way that would greatly grieve   me; no matter how valiant a man may be he can do nothing against numbers, for they will be too strong for him."""	τὸν δʼ αὖ Τηλέμαχος πεπνυμένος ἀντίον ηὔδα· Εὔμαιʼ, ἦ μάλα τοῦτο ἔπος θυμαλγὲς ἔειπες· πῶς γὰρ δὴ τὸν ξεῖνον ἐγὼν ὑποδέξομαι οἴκῳ; αὐτὸς μὲν νέος εἰμὶ καὶ οὔ πω χερσὶ πέποιθα ἄνδρʼ ἀπαμύνασθαι, ὅτε τις πρότερος χαλεπήνῃ· μητρὶ δʼ ἐμῇ δίχα θυμὸς ἐνὶ φρεσὶ μερμηρίζει, ἢ αὐτοῦ παρʼ ἐμοί τε μένῃ καὶ δῶμα κομίζῃ, εὐνήν τʼ αἰδομένη πόσιος δήμοιό τε φῆμιν, ἦ ἤδη ἅμʼ ἕπηται Ἀχαιῶν ὅς τις ἄριστος μνᾶται ἐνὶ μεγάροισιν ἀνὴρ καὶ πλεῖστα πόρῃσιν. ἀλλʼ ἦ τοὶ τὸν ξεῖνον, ἐπεὶ τεὸν ἵκετο δῶμα, ἕσσω μιν χλαῖνάν τε χιτῶνά τε, εἵματα καλά, δώσω δὲ ξίφος ἄμφηκες καὶ ποσσὶ πέδιλα, πέμψω δʼ ὅππη μιν κραδίη θυμός τε κελεύει. εἰ δʼ ἐθέλεις, σὺ κόμισσον ἐνὶ σταθμοῖσιν ἐρύξας· εἵματα δʼ ἐνθάδʼ ἐγὼ πέμψω καὶ σῖτον ἅπαντα ἔδμεναι, ὡς ἂν μή σε κατατρύχῃ καὶ ἑταίρους. κεῖσε δʼ ἂν οὔ μιν ἐγώ γε μετὰ μνηστῆρας ἐῷμι ἔρχεσθαι· λίην γὰρ ἀτάσθαλον ὕβριν ἔχουσι· μή μιν κερτομέωσιν, ἐμοὶ δʼ ἄχος ἔσσεται αἰνόν. πρῆξαι δʼ ἀργαλέον τι μετὰ πλεόνεσσιν ἐόντα ἄνδρα καὶ ἴφθιμον, ἐπεὶ ἦ πολὺ φέρτεροί εἰσι.
"Then Odysseus said, ""Sir, it is right that I should say something myself. I am much shocked about what you have said about the insolent way in which the suitors are behaving in despite of such a man as you are. Tell me, do you submit to such treatment tamely, or do the people of your , following the voice of some god, hate   you? May you not complain of your brothers - for it is to these that a man may look for support, however great his quarrel may be? I wish I were as young as you are and in my present mind; if I were son to Odysseus, or, indeed, Odysseus himself, I would rather some one came and cut my head off, but I would go to the house and be the bane of every one of these men. If they were too many for me - I being single-handed - I would rather die fighting in my own house than see such disgraceful sights day after day, strangers grossly maltreated, and men dragging the women servants about the house in an unseemly way, wine drawn recklessly, and bread wasted all to no purpose for an end that shall never be accomplished."""	τὸν δʼ αὖτε προσέειπε πολύτλας δῖος Ὀδυσσεύς· ὦ φίλʼ, ἐπεί θήν μοι καὶ ἀμείψασθαι θέμις ἐστίν, ἦ μάλα μευ καταδάπτετʼ ἀκούοντος φίλον ἦτορ, οἷά φατε μνηστῆρας ἀτάσθαλα μηχανάασθαι ἐν μεγάροις, ἀέκητι σέθεν τοιούτου ἐόντος. εἰπέ μοι ἠὲ ἑκὼν ὑποδάμνασαι, ἦ σέ γε λαοὶ ἐχθαίρουσʼ ἀνὰ δῆμον, ἐπισπόμενοι θεοῦ ὀμφῇ, ἦ τι κασιγνήτοις ἐπιμέμφεαι, οἷσί περ ἀνὴρ μαρναμένοισι πέποιθε, καὶ εἰ μέγα νεῖκος ὄρηται. αἲ γάρ ἐγὼν οὕτω νέος εἴην τῷδʼ ἐπὶ θυμῷ, ἢ παῖς ἐξ Ὀδυσῆος ἀμύμονος ἠὲ καὶ αὐτός· αὐτίκʼ ἔπειτʼ ἀπʼ ἐμεῖο κάρη τάμοι ἀλλότριος φώς, εἰ μὴ ἐγὼ κείνοισι κακὸν πάντεσσι γενοίμην, ἐλθὼν ἐς μέγαρον Λαερτιάδεω Ὀδυσῆος. εἰ δʼ αὖ με πληθυῖ δαμασαίατο μοῦνον ἐόντα, βουλοίμην κʼ ἐν ἐμοῖσι κατακτάμενος μεγάροισι τεθνάμεν ἢ τάδε γʼ αἰὲν ἀεικέα ἔργʼ ὁράασθαι, ξείνους τε στυφελιζομένους δμῳάς τε γυναῖκας ῥυστάζοντας ἀεικελίως κατὰ δώματα καλά, καὶ οἶνον διαφυσσόμενον, καὶ σῖτον ἔδοντας μὰψ αὔτως, ἀτέλεστον, ἀνηνύστῳ ἐπὶ ἔργῳ.
"And Telemakhos answered, ""I will tell you truly everything. There is no enmity between me and my , nor can I complain of brothers, to whom a man may look for support however great his quarrel may be. Zeus has made us a race of only sons. Laertes was the only son of Arceisius, and Odysseus only son of Laertes . I am myself the only son of Odysseus who left me behind him when he went away, so that I have never been of any use to him. Hence it comes that my house is in the hands of numberless marauders; for the chiefs from all the neighboring islands, Dulichium, Same, Zacynthus , as also all the principal men of Ithaca itself, are eating up my house under the pretext of paying court to my mother, who will neither say point blank that she will not marry, nor yet bring matters to an end, so they are making havoc of my estate, and before long will do so with myself into the bargain. The issue, however, rests with heaven. But do you, old friend Eumaios, go at once and tell Penelope that I am safe and have returned from Pylos . Tell it to herself alone, and then come back here without letting any one else know, for there are many who are plotting mischief against me."""	τὸν δʼ αὖ Τηλέμαχος πεπνυμένος ἀντίον ηὔδα· τοιγὰρ ἐγώ τοι, ξεῖνε, μάλʼ ἀτρεκέως ἀγορεύσω. οὔτε τί μοι πᾶς δῆμος ἀπεχθόμενος χαλεπαίνει, οὔτε κασιγνήτοις ἐπιμέμφομαι, οἷσί περ ἀνὴρ μαρναμένοισι πέποιθε, καὶ εἰ μέγα νεῖκος ὄρηται. ὧδε γὰρ ἡμετέρην γενεὴν μούνωσε Κρονίων· μοῦνον Λαέρτην Ἀρκείσιος υἱὸν ἔτικτε, μοῦνον δʼ αὖτʼ Ὀδυσῆα πατὴρ τέκεν· αὐτὰρ Ὀδυσσεὺς μοῦνον ἔμʼ ἐν μεγάροισι τεκὼν λίπεν οὐδʼ ἀπόνητο. τῷ νῦν δυσμενέες μάλα μυρίοι εἴσʼ ἐνὶ οἴκῳ. ὅσσοι γὰρ νήσοισιν ἐπικρατέουσιν ἄριστοι, Δουλιχίῳ τε Σάμῃ τε καὶ ὑλήεντι Ζακύνθῳ, ἠδʼ ὅσσοι κραναὴν Ἰθάκην κάτα κοιρανέουσι, τόσσοι μητέρʼ ἐμὴν μνῶνται, τρύχουσι δὲ οἶκον. ἡ δʼ οὔτʼ ἀρνεῖται στυγερὸν γάμον οὔτε τελευτὴν ποιῆσαι δύναται· τοὶ δὲ φθινύθουσιν ἔδοντες οἶκον ἐμόν· τάχα δή με διαρραίσουσι καὶ αὐτόν. ἀλλʼ ἦ τοι μὲν ταῦτα θεῶν ἐν γούνασι κεῖται· ἄττα, σὺ δʼ ἔρχεο θᾶσσον, ἐχέφρονι Πηνελοπείῃ εἴφʼ ὅτι οἱ σῶς εἰμὶ καὶ ἐκ Πύλου εἰλήλουθα. αὐτὰρ ἐγὼν αὐτοῦ μενέω, σὺ δὲ δεῦρο νέεσθαι, οἴῃ ἀπαγγείλας· τῶν δʼ ἄλλων μή τις Ἀχαιῶν πευθέσθω· πολλοὶ γὰρ ἐμοὶ κακὰ μηχανόωνται.
"""I understand and heed you,"" replied Eumaios; ""you need instruct me no further, only I am going that way say whether I had not better let poor Laertes know that you are returned. He used to superintend the work on his farm in spite of his bitter sorrow about Odysseus, and he would eat and drink at will along with his servants; but they tell me that from the day on which you set out for Pylos he has neither eaten nor drunk as he ought to do, nor does he look after his farm, but sits weeping and wasting the flesh from off his bones."""	τὸν δʼ ἀπαμειβόμενος προσέφης, Εὔμαιε συβῶτα· γιγνώσκω, φρονέω· τά γε δὴ νοέοντι κελεύεις. ἀλλʼ ἄγε μοι τόδε εἰπὲ καὶ ἀτρεκέως κατάλεξον, ἦ καὶ Λαέρτῃ αὐτὴν ὁδὸν ἄγγελος ἔλθω δυσμόρῳ, ὃς τῆος μὲν Ὀδυσσῆος μέγʼ ἀχεύων ἔργα τʼ ἐποπτεύεσκε μετὰ δμώων τʼ ἐνὶ οἴκῳ πῖνε καὶ ἦσθʼ, ὅτε θυμὸς ἐνὶ στήθεσσιν ἀνώγοι· αὐτὰρ νῦν, ἐξ οὗ σύ γε ᾤχεο νηῒ Πύλονδε, οὔ πω μίν φασιν φαγέμεν καὶ πιέμεν αὔτως, οὐδʼ ἐπὶ ἔργα ἰδεῖν, ἀλλὰ στοναχῇ τε γόῳ τε ἧσται ὀδυρόμενος, φθινύθει δʼ ἀμφʼ ὀστεόφι χρώς.
"""More's the pity,"" answered Telemakhos, ""I am sorry for him, but we must leave him to himself just now. If people could have everything their own way, the first thing I should choose would be the return of my father; but go, and give your message; then make haste back again, and do not turn out of your way to tell Laertes . Tell my mother to send one of her women secretly with the news at once, and let him hear it from her."""	τὸν δʼ αὖ Τηλέμαχος πεπνυμένος ἀντίον ηὔδα· ἄλγιον, ἀλλʼ ἔμπης μιν ἐάσομεν, ἀχνύμενοί περ· εἰ γὰρ πως εἴη αὐτάγρετα πάντα βροτοῖσι, πρῶτόν κεν τοῦ πατρὸς ἑλοίμεθα νόστιμον ἦμαρ. ἀλλὰ σύ γʼ ἀγγείλας ὀπίσω κίε, μηδὲ κατʼ ἀγροὺς πλάζεσθαι μετʼ ἐκεῖνον· ἀτὰρ πρὸς μητέρα εἰπεῖν ἀμφίπολον ταμίην ὀτρυνέμεν ὅττι τάχιστα κρύβδην· κείνη γὰρ κεν ἀπαγγείλειε γέροντι.
Thus did he urge the swineherd; Eumaios, therefore, took his sandals, bound them to his feet, and started for the town. Athena watched him well off the station, and then came up to it in the form of a woman - fair, stately, and wise. She stood against the side of the entry, and revealed herself to Odysseus, but Telemakhos could not see her, and knew not that she was there, for the gods do not let themselves be seen by everybody. Odysseus saw her, and so did the dogs, for they did not bark, but went scared and whining off to the other side of the yards. She nodded her head and motioned to Odysseus with her eyebrows; whereon he left the hut and stood before her outside the main wall of the yards. Then she said to him:	ἦ ῥα καὶ ὦρσε συφορβόν· ὁ δʼ εἵλετο χερσὶ πέδιλα, δησάμενος δʼ ὑπὸ ποσσὶ πόλινδʼ ἴεν. οὐδʼ ἄρʼ Ἀθήνην λῆθεν ἀπὸ σταθμοῖο κιὼν Εὔμαιος ὑφορβός, ἀλλʼ ἥ γε σχεδὸν ἦλθε· δέμας δʼ ἤϊκτο γυναικὶ καλῇ τε μεγάλῃ τε καὶ ἀγλαὰ ἔργα ἰδυίῃ. στῆ δὲ κατʼ ἀντίθυρον κλισίης Ὀδυσῆϊ φανεῖσα· οὐδʼ ἄρα Τηλέμαχος ἴδεν ἀντίον οὐδʼ ἐνόησεν, οὐ γὰρ πω πάντεσσι θεοὶ φαίνονται ἐναργεῖς, ἀλλʼ Ὀδυσεύς τε κύνες τε ἴδον, καί ῥʼ οὐχ ὑλάοντο κνυζηθμῷ δʼ ἑτέρωσε διὰ σταθμοῖο φόβηθεν. ἡ δʼ ἄρʼ ἐπʼ ὀφρύσι νεῦσε· νόησε δὲ δῖος Ὀδυσσεύς, ἐκ δʼ ἦλθεν μεγάροιο παρὲκ μέγα τειχίον αὐλῆς, στῆ δὲ πάροιθʼ αὐτῆς· τὸν δὲ προσέειπεν Ἀθήνη·
"""Odysseus, noble son of Laertes , it is now time for you to tell your son: do not keep him in the dark any longer, but lay your plans for the destruction of the suitors, and then make for the town. I will not be long in joining you, for I too am eager for the fray."""	διογενὲς Λαερτιάδη, πολυμήχανʼ Ὀδυσσεῦ. ἤδη νῦν σῷ παιδὶ ἔπος φάο μηδʼ ἐπίκευθε, ὡς ἄν μνηστῆρσιν θάνατον καὶ κῆρʼ ἀραρόντε ἔρχησθον προτὶ ἄστυ περικλυτόν· οὐδʼ ἐγὼ αὐτὴ δηρὸν ἀπὸ σφῶϊν ἔσομαι μεμαυῖα μάχεσθαι.
As she spoke she touched him with her golden wand. First she threw a fair clean shirt and cloak about his shoulders; then she made him younger and of more imposing presence; she gave him back his color, filled out his cheeks, and let his beard become dark again. Then she went away and Odysseus came back inside the hut. His son was astounded when he saw him, and turned his eyes away for fear he might be looking upon a god.	ἦ καὶ χρυσείῃ ῥάβδῳ ἐπεμάσσατʼ Ἀθήνη. φᾶρος μέν οἱ πρῶτον ἐϋπλυνὲς ἠδὲ χιτῶνα θῆκʼ ἀμφὶ στήθεσσι, δέμας δʼ ὤφελλε καὶ ἥβην. ἂψ δὲ μελαγχροιὴς γένετο, γναθμοὶ δὲ τάνυσθεν, κυάνεαι δʼ ἐγένοντο γενειάδες ἀμφὶ γένειον. ἡ μὲν ἄρʼ ὣς ἔρξασα πάλιν κίεν· αὐτὰρ Ὀδυσσεὺς ἤϊεν ἐς κλισίην· θάμβησε δέ μιν φίλος υἱός, ταρβήσας δʼ ἑτέρωσε βάλʼ ὄμματα, μὴ θεὸς εἴη, καί μιν φωνήσας ἔπεα πτερόεντα προσηύδα·
"""Stranger,"" said he, ""how suddenly you have changed from what you were a moment or two ago. You are dressed differently and your color is not the same. Are you some one or other of the gods that live in heaven? If so, be propitious to me till I can make you due sacrifice and offerings of wrought gold. Have mercy upon me."""	ἀλλοῖός μοι, ξεῖνε, φάνης νέον ἠὲ πάροιθεν, ἄλλα δὲ εἵματʼ ἔχεις, καί τοι χρὼς οὐκέθʼ ὁμοῖος. ἦ μάλα τις θεός ἐσσι, τοὶ οὐρανὸν εὐρὺν ἔχουσιν· ἀλλʼ ἵληθʼ, ἵνα τοι κεχαρισμένα δώομεν ἱρὰ ἠδὲ χρύσεα δῶρα, τετυγμένα· φείδεο δʼ ἡμέων
"And Odysseus said, ""I am no god, why should you take me for one? I am your father, on whose account you grieve and suffer so much at the hands of violent   men."""	τὸν δʼ ἠμείβετʼ ἔπειτα πολύτλας δῖος Ὀδυσσεύς· οὔ τίς τοι θεός εἰμι· τί μʼ ἀθανάτοισιν ἐΐσκεις; ἀλλὰ πατὴρ τεός εἰμι, τοῦ εἵνεκα σὺ στεναχίζων πάσχεις ἄλγεα πολλά, βίας ὑποδέγμενος ἀνδρῶν.
As he spoke he kissed his son, and a tear fell from his cheek on to the ground, for he had restrained all tears till now. but Telemakhos could not yet believe that it was his father, and said:	ὣς ἄρα φωνήσας υἱὸν κύσε, κὰδ δὲ παρειῶν δάκρυον ἧκε χαμᾶζε· πάρος δʼ ἔχε νωλεμὲς αἰεί. Τηλέμαχος δʼ, οὐ γάρ πω ἐπείθετο ὃν πατέρʼ εἶναι, ἐξαῦτίς μιν ἔπεσσιν ἀμειβόμενος προσέειπεν·
"""You are not my father, but some is flattering me with vain hopes that I may grieve the more hereafter; no mortal man could of himself contrive with his to do as you have been doing, and make yourself old and young at a moment's notice, unless a god were with him. A second ago you were old and all in rags, and now you are like some god come down from heaven."""	οὐ σύ γʼ Ὀδυσσεύς ἐσσι, πατὴρ ἐμός, ἀλλά με δαίμων θέλγει, ὄφρʼ ἔτι μᾶλλον ὀδυρόμενος στεναχίζω. οὐ γάρ πως ἂν θνητὸς ἀνὴρ τάδε μηχανόῳτο ᾧ αὐτοῦ γε νόῳ, ὅτε μὴ θεὸς αὐτὸς ἐπελθὼν ῥηϊδίως ἐθέλων θείη νέον ἠὲ γέροντα. ἦ γάρ τοι νέον ἦσθα γέρων καὶ ἀεικέα ἕσσο· νῦν δὲ θεοῖσιν ἔοικας, οἳ οὐρανὸν εὐρὺν ἔχουσι.
"Odysseus answered, ""Telemakhos, you ought not to be so immeasurably astonished at my being really here. There is no other Odysseus who will come hereafter. Such as I am, it is I, who after long wandering and much hardship have got home in the twentieth year to my own country. What you wonder at is the work of the redoubtable goddess Athena, who does with me whatever she will, for she can do what she pleases. At one moment she makes me like a beggar, and the next I am a young man with good clothes on my back; it is an easy matter for the gods who live in heaven to make any man look either rich or poor."""	τὸν δʼ ἀπαμειβόμενος προσέφη πολύμητις Ὀδυσσεύς· Τηλέμαχʼ, οὔ σε ἔοικε φίλον πατέρ ἔνδον ἐόντα οὔτε τι θαυμάζειν περιώσιον οὔτʼ ἀγάασθαι· οὐ μὲν γάρ τοι ἔτʼ ἄλλος ἐλεύσεται ἐνθάδʼ Ὀδυσσεύς, ἀλλʼ ὅδʼ ἐγὼ τοιόσδε, παθὼν κακά, πολλὰ δʼ ἀληθείς, ἤλυθον εἰκοστῷ ἔτεϊ ἐς πατρίδα γαῖαν. αὐτάρ τοι τόδε ἔργον Ἀθηναίης ἀγελείης, ἥ τέ με τοῖον ἔθηκεν, ὅπως ἐθέλει, δύναται γὰρ, ἄλλοτε μὲν πτωχῷ ἐναλίγκιον, ἄλλοτε δʼ αὖτε ἀνδρὶ νέῳ καὶ καλὰ περὶ χροῒ εἵματʼ ἔχοντι. ῥηΐδιον δὲ θεοῖσι, τοὶ οὐρανὸν εὐρὺν ἔχουσιν, ἠμὲν κυδῆναι θνητὸν βροτὸν ἠδὲ κακῶσαι.
"As he spoke he sat down, and Telemakhos threw his arms about his father and wept. They were both so much moved that they cried aloud like eagles or vultures with crooked talons that have been robbed of their half fledged young by peasants. Thus piteously did they weep, and the sun would have gone down upon their mourning if Telemakhos had not suddenly said, ""In what ship, my dear father, did your crew bring you to Ithaca ? Of what nation did they declare themselves to be - for you cannot have come by land?"""	ὣς ἄρα φωνήσας κατʼ ἄρʼ ἕζετο, Τηλέμαχος δὲ ἀμφιχυθεὶς πατέρʼ ἐσθλὸν ὀδύρετο, δάκρυα λείβων, ἀμφοτέροισι δὲ τοῖσιν ὑφʼ ἵμερος ὦρτο γόοιο· κλαῖον δὲ λιγέως, ἀδινώτερον ἤ τʼ οἰωνοί, φῆναι ἢ αἰγυπιοὶ γαμψώνυχες, οἷσί τε τέκνα ἀγρόται ἐξείλοντο πάρος πετεηνὰ γενέσθαι· ὣς ἄρα τοί γʼ ἐλεεινὸν ὑπʼ ὀφρύσι δάκρυον εἶβον. καί νύ κʼ ὀδυρομένοισιν ἔδυ φάος ἠελίοιο, εἰ μὴ Τηλέμαχος προσεφώνεεν ὃν πατέρʼ αἶψα· ποίῃ γὰρ νῦν δεῦρο, πάτερ φίλε, νηΐ σε ναῦται ἤγαγον εἰς Ἰθάκην; τίνες ἔμμεναι εὐχετόωντο; οὐ μὲν γάρ τί σε πεζὸν ὀΐομαι ἐνθάδʼ ἱκέσθαι. τὸν δʼ αὖτε προσέειπε πολύτλας δῖος Ὀδυσσεύς·
"""I will tell you the truth  , my son,"" replied Odysseus. ""It was the Phaeacians who brought me here. They are great sailors, and are in the habit of giving escorts to any one who reaches their coasts. They took me over the sea while I was fast asleep, and landed me in Ithaca , after giving me many presents in bronze, gold, and raiment. These things by heaven's mercy are lying concealed in a cave, and I am now come here on the suggestion of Athena that we may consult about killing our enemies. First, therefore, give me a list of the suitors, with their number, that I may learn who, and how many, they are. I can then turn the matter over in my mind, and see whether we two can fight the whole body of them ourselves, or whether we must find others to help us."""	τοιγὰρ ἐγώ τοι, τέκνον, ἀληθείην καταλέξω.

"To this Telemakhos answered, ""Father, I have always heard of your renown   both in the field and in council, but the task you talk of is a very great one: I am awed at the mere thought of it; two men cannot stand against many and brave ones. There are not ten suitors only, nor twice ten, but ten many times over; you shall learn their number at once. There are fifty-two chosen   youths from Dulichium, and they have six servants; from Same there are twenty-four; twenty young Achaeans from Zacynthus , and twelve from Ithaca itself, all of them well born. They have with them a servant Medon, a bard, and two men who can carve at table. If we face such numbers as this, you may have bitter cause to rue your coming, and your violent revenge  . See whether you cannot think of some one who would be willing to come and help us."""	τὸν δʼ αὖ Τηλέμαχος πεπνυμένος ἀντίον ηὔδα· ὦ πάτερ, ἦ τοι σεῖο μέγα κλέος αἰὲν ἄκουον, χεῖράς τʼ αἰχμητὴν ἔμεναι καὶ ἐπίφρονα βουλήν· ἀλλὰ λίην μέγα εἶπες· ἄγη μʼ ἔχει· οὐδέ κεν εἴη ἄνδρε δύω πολλοῖσι καὶ ἰφθίμοισι μάχεσθαι. μνηστήρων δʼ οὔτʼ ἂρ δεκὰς ἀτρεκὲς οὔτε δύʼ οἶαι, ἀλλὰ πολὺ πλέονες· τάχα δʼ εἴσεαι ἐνθάδʼ ἀριθμόν. ἐκ μὲν Δουλιχίοιο δύω καὶ πεντήκοντα κοῦροι κεκριμένοι, ἓξ δὲ δρηστῆρες ἕπονται· ἐκ δὲ Σάμης πίσυρές τε καὶ εἴκοσι φῶτες ἔασιν, ἐκ δὲ Ζακύνθου ἔασιν ἐείκοσι κοῦροι Ἀχαιῶν, ἐκ δʼ αὐτῆς Ἰθάκης δυοκαίδεκα πάντες ἄριστοι, καί σφιν ἅμʼ ἐστὶ Μέδων κῆρυξ καὶ θεῖος ἀοιδὸς καὶ δοιὼ θεράποντε, δαήμονε δαιτροσυνάων. τῶν εἴ κεν πάντων ἀντήσομεν ἔνδον ἐόντων, μὴ πολύπικρα καὶ αἰνὰ βίας ἀποτίσεαι ἐλθών. ἀλλὰ σύ γʼ, εἰ δύνασαί τινʼ ἀμύντορα μερμηρίξαι,
"""Listen to me,"" replied Odysseus, ""and think whether Athena and her father Zeus may seem sufficient, or whether I am to try and find some one else as well."""	φράζευ, ὅ κέν τις νῶϊν ἀμύνοι πρόφρονι θυμῷ. τὸν δʼ αὖτε προσέειπε πολύτλας δῖος Ὀδυσσεύς· τοιγὰρ ἐγὼν ἐρέω, σὺ δὲ σύνθεο καί μευ ἄκουσον· καὶ φράσαι ἤ κεν νῶϊν Ἀθήνη σὺν Διὶ πατρὶ ἀρκέσει, ἦέ τινʼ ἄλλον ἀμύντορα μερμηρίξω.
"""Those whom you have named,"" answered Telemakhos, ""are a couple of good allies, for though they dwell high up among the clouds they have power over both gods and men."""	τὸν δʼ αὖ Τηλέμαχος πεπνυμένος ἀντίον ηὔδα· ἐσθλώ τοι τούτω γʼ ἐπαμύντορε, τοὺς ἀγορεύεις, ὕψι περ ἐν νεφέεσσι καθημένω· ὥ τε καὶ ἄλλοις ἀνδράσι τε κρατέουσι καὶ ἀθανάτοισι θεοῖσι.
"""These two,"" continued Odysseus, ""will not keep long out of the fray, when the suitors and we join fight in my house. Now, therefore, return home early tomorrow morning, and go about among the suitors as before. Later on the swineherd will bring me to the city disguised as a miserable old beggar. If you see them ill-treating me, steel your heart against my sufferings; even though they drag me feet foremost out of the house, or throw things at me, look on and do nothing beyond gently trying to make them behave more reasonably; but they will not listen to you, for the day of their reckoning is at hand. Furthermore I say, and lay my saying to your heart, when Athena shall put it in my mind, I will nod my head to you, and on seeing me do this you must collect all the armor that is in the house and hide it in the strong store room. Make some excuse when the suitors ask you why you are removing it; say that you have taken it to be out of the way of the smoke, inasmuch as it is no longer what it was when Odysseus went away, but has become soiled and begrimed with soot. Add to this more particularly that you are afraid Zeus may set them on to quarrel over their wine, and that they may do each other some harm which may disgrace both banquet and wooing, for the sight of arms sometimes tempts people to use them. But leave a sword and a spear apiece for yourself and me, and a couple oxhide shields so that we can snatch them up at any moment; Zeus and Athena will then soon quiet these people. There is also another matter; if you are indeed my son and my blood runs in your veins, let no one know that Odysseus is within the house - neither Laertes , nor yet the swineherd, nor any of the servants, nor even Penelope herself. Let you and me make trial the women alone, and let us also make trial of some other of the men servants, to see who is on our side and whose hand is against us."""	τὸν δʼ αὖτε προσέειπε πολύτλας δῖος Ὀδυσσεύς· οὐ μέν τοι κείνω γε πολὺν χρόνον ἀμφὶς ἔσεσθον φυλόπιδος κρατερῆς, ὁπότε μνηστῆρσι καὶ ἡμῖν ἐν μεγάροισιν ἐμοῖσι μένος κρίνηται Ἄρηος. ἀλλὰ σὺ μὲν νῦν ἔρχευ ἅμʼ ἠοῖ φαινομένηφιν οἴκαδε, καὶ μνηστῆρσιν ὑπερφιάλοισιν ὁμίλει· αὐτὰρ ἐμὲ προτὶ ἄστυ συβώτης ὕστερον ἄξει, πτωχῷ λευγαλέῳ ἐναλίγκιον ἠδὲ γέροντι. εἰ δέ μʼ ἀτιμήσουσι δόμον κάτα, σὸν δὲ φίλον κῆρ τετλάτω ἐν στήθεσσι κακῶς πάσχοντος ἐμεῖο, ἤν περ καὶ διὰ δῶμα ποδῶν ἕλκωσι θύραζε ἢ βέλεσι βάλλωσι· σὺ δʼ εἰσορόων ἀνέχεσθαι. ἀλλʼ ἦ τοι παύεσθαι ἀνωγέμεν ἀφροσυνάων, μειλιχίοις ἐπέεσσι παραυδῶν· οἱ δέ τοι οὔ τι πείσονται· δὴ γάρ σφι παρίσταται αἴσιμον ἦμαρ. ἄλλο δέ τοι ἐρέω, σὺ δʼ ἐνὶ φρεσὶ βάλλεο σῇσιν· ὁππότε κεν πολύβουλος ἐνὶ φρεσὶ θῇσιν Ἀθήνη, νεύσω μέν τοι ἐγὼ κεφαλῇ, σὺ δʼ ἔπειτα νοήσας ὅσσα τοι ἐν μεγάροισιν Ἀρήϊα τεύχεα κεῖται ἐς μυχὸν ὑψηλοῦ θαλάμου καταθεῖναι ἀείρας πάντα μάλʼ· αὐτὰρ μνηστῆρας μαλακοῖς ἐπέεσσι παρφάσθαι, ὅτε κέν σε μεταλλῶσιν ποθέοντες· ἐκ καπνοῦ κατέθηκʼ, ἐπεὶ οὐκέτι τοῖσιν ἐῴκει οἷά ποτε Τροίηνδε κιὼν κατέλειπεν Ὀδυσσεύς, ἀλλὰ κατῄκισται, ὅσσον πυρὸς ἵκετʼ ἀϋτμή. πρὸς δʼ ἔτι καὶ τόδε μεῖζον ἐνὶ φρεσὶ θῆκε Κρονίων, μή πως οἰνωθέντες, ἔριν στήσαντες ἐν ὑμῖν, ἀλλήλους τρώσητε καταισχύνητέ τε δαῖτα καὶ μνηστύν· αὐτὸς γὰρ ἐφέλκεται ἄνδρα σίδηρος. νῶϊν δʼ οἴοισιν δύο φάσγανα καὶ δύο δοῦρε καλλιπέειν καὶ δοιὰ βοάγρια χερσὶν ἑλέσθαι, ὡς ἂν ἐπιθύσαντες ἑλοίμεθα· τοὺς δέ κʼ ἔπειτα Παλλὰς Ἀθηναίη θέλξει καὶ μητίετα Ζεύς. ἄλλο δέ τοι ἐρέω, σὺ δʼ ἐνὶ φρεσὶ βάλλεο σῇσιν· εἰ ἐτεόν γʼ ἐμός ἐσσι καὶ αἵματος ἡμετέροιο, μή τις ἔπειτʼ Ὀδυσῆος ἀκουσάτω ἔνδον ἐόντος, μήτʼ οὖν Λαέρτης ἴστω τό γε μήτε συβώτης μήτε τις οἰκήων μήτʼ αὐτὴ Πηνελόπεια, ἀλλʼ οἶοι σύ τʼ ἐγώ τε γυναικῶν γνώομεν ἰθύν· καί κέ τεο δμώων ἀνδρῶν ἔτι πειρηθεῖμεν, ἠμὲν ὅπου τις νῶϊ τίει καὶ δείδιε θυμῷ, ἠδʼ ὅτις οὐκ ἀλέγει, σὲ δʼ ἀτιμᾷ τοῖον ἐόντα.
"""Father,"" replied Telemakhos, ""you will come to know me by and by, and when you do you will find that I can keep your counsel. I do not think, however, the plan you propose will be a gain   for either of us. Think it over. It will take us a long time to go the round of the farms and exploit the men, and all the time the suitors will be wasting your estate with impunity and without compunction. Prove the women by all means, to see who are disloyal and who guiltless, but I am not in favor of going round and trying the men. We can attend to that later on, if you really have some sign from Zeus that he will support you."""	τὸν δʼ ἀπαμειβόμενος προσεφώνεε φαίδιμος υἱός ὦ πάτερ, ἦ τοι ἐμὸν θυμὸν καὶ ἔπειτά γʼ, ὀΐω, γνώσεαι· οὐ μὲν γάρ τι χαλιφροσύναι γέ μʼ ἔχουσιν· ἀλλʼ οὔ τοι τόδε κέρδος ἐγὼν ἔσσεσθαι ὀΐω ἡμῖν ἀμφοτέροισι· σὲ δὲ φράζεσθαι ἄνωγα. δηθὰ γὰρ αὔτως εἴσῃ ἑκάστου πειρητίζων, ἔργα μετερχόμενος· τοὶ δʼ ἐν μεγάροισιν ἕκηλοι χρήματα δαρδάπτουσιν ὑπέρβιον οὐδʼ ἔπι φειδώ. ἀλλʼ ἦ τοί σε γυναῖκας ἐγὼ δεδάασθαι ἄνωγα, αἵ τέ σʼ ἀτιμάζουσι καὶ αἳ νηλείτιδές εἰσιν· ἀνδρῶν δʼ οὐκ ἂν ἐγώ γε κατὰ σταθμοὺς ἐθέλοιμι ἡμέας πειράζειν, ἀλλʼ ὕστερα ταῦτα πένεσθαι, εἰ ἐτεόν γέ τι οἶσθα Διὸς τέρας αἰγιόχοιο.
"Thus did they converse, and meanwhile the ship which had brought Telemakhos and his crew from Pylos had reached the town of Ithaca . When they had come inside the harbor they drew the ship on to the land; their servants came and took their armor from them, and they left all the presents at the house of Klytios. Then they sent a servant to tell Penelope that Telemakhos had gone into the country, but had sent the ship to the town to prevent her from being alarmed and made unhappy. This servant and Eumaios happened to meet when they were both on the same errand of going to tell Penelope. When they reached the House, the servant stood up and said to the queen in the presence of the waiting women, ""Your son, my lady, is now returned from Pylos ""; but Eumaios went close up to Penelope, and said privately that her son had given bidden him tell her. When he had given his message he left the house with its outbuildings and went back to his pigs again."	ὣς οἱ μὲν τοιαῦτα πρὸς ἀλλήλους ἀγόρευον, ἡ δʼ ἄρʼ ἔπειτʼ Ἰθάκηνδε κατήγετο νηῦς εὐεργής, ἣ φέρε Τηλέμαχον Πυλόθεν καὶ πάντας ἑταίρους. οἱ δʼ ὅτε δὴ λιμένος πολυβενθέος ἐντὸς ἵκοντο, νῆα μὲν οἵ γε μέλαιναν ἐπʼ ἠπείροιο ἔρυσσαν, τεύχεα δέ σφʼ ἀπένεικαν ὑπέρθυμοι θεράποντες, αὐτίκα δʼ ἐς Κλυτίοιο φέρον περικαλλέα δῶρα. αὐτὰρ κήρυκα πρόεσαν δόμον εἰς Ὀδυσῆος, ἀγγελίην ἐρέοντα περίφρονι Πηνελοπείῃ, οὕνεκα Τηλέμαχος μὲν ἐπʼ ἀγροῦ, νῆα δʼ ἀνώγει ἄστυδʼ ἀποπλείειν, ἵνα μὴ δείσασʼ ἐνὶ θυμῷ ἰφθίμη βασίλεια τέρεν κατὰ δάκρυον εἴβοι τὼ δὲ συναντήτην κῆρυξ καὶ δῖος ὑφορβὸς τῆς αὐτῆς ἕνεκʼ ἀγγελίης, ἐρέοντε γυναικί. ἀλλʼ ὅτε δή ῥʼ ἵκοντο δόμον θείου βασιλῆος, κῆρυξ μέν ῥα μέσῃσι μετὰ δμῳῇσιν ἔειπεν· ἤδη τοι, βασίλεια, φίλος πάϊς εἰλήλουθε.

The suitors were surprised and angry at what had happened, so they went outside the great wall that ran round the outer court, and held a council near the main entrance. Eurymakhos, son of Polybos, was the first to speak.	μνηστῆρες δʼ ἀκάχοντο κατήφησάν τʼ ἐνὶ θυμῷ, ἐκ δʼ ἦλθον μεγάροιο παρὲκ μέγα τειχίον αὐλῆς, αὐτοῦ δὲ προπάροιθε θυράων ἑδριόωντο. τοῖσιν δʼ Εὐρύμαχος, Πολύβου πάϊς, ἦρχʼ ἀγορεύειν·
"""My friends,"" said he, ""this voyage of Telemakhos’ is a very serious matter; we had made sure that it would come to nothing. Now, however, let us draw a ship into the water, and get a crew together to send after the others and tell them to come back as fast as they can."""	ὦ φίλοι, ἦ μέγα ἔργον ὑπερφιάλως τετέλεσται Τηλεμάχῳ ὁδὸς ἥδε· φάμεν δέ οἱ οὐ τελέεσθαι. ἀλλʼ ἄγε νῆα μέλαιναν ἐρύσσομεν ἥ τις ἀρίστη, ἐς δʼ ἐρέτας ἁλιῆας ἀγείρομεν, οἵ κε τάχιστα κείνοις ἀγγείλωσι θοῶς οἶκόνδε νέεσθαι.
"He had hardly done speaking when Amphinomos turned in his place and saw the ship inside the harbor, with the crew lowering her sails, and putting by their oars; so he laughed, and said to the others, ""We need not send them any message, for they are here. Some god must have told them, or else they saw the ship go by, and could not overtake her."	οὔ πω πᾶν εἴρηθʼ, ὅτʼ ἄρʼ Ἀμφίνομος ἴδε νῆα, στρεφθεὶς ἐκ χώρης, λιμένος πολυβενθέος ἐντός, ἱστία τε στέλλοντας ἐρετμά τε χερσὶν ἔχοντας. ἡδὺ δʼ ἄρʼ ἐκγελάσας μετεφώνεεν οἷς ἑτάροισι· μή τινʼ ἔτʼ ἀγγελίην ὀτρύνομεν· οἵδε γὰρ ἔνδον. ἤ τίς σφιν τόδʼ ἔειπε θεῶν, ἢ εἴσιδον αὐτοὶ νῆα παρερχομένην, τὴν δʼ οὐκ ἐδύναντο κιχῆναι.
On this they rose and went to the water side. The crew then drew the ship on shore; their servants took their armor from them, and they went up in a body to the place of assembly, but they would not let any one old or young sit along with them, and Antinoos, son of Eupeithes, spoke first.	ὣς ἔφαθʼ, οἱ δʼ ἀνστάντες ἔβαν ἐπὶ θῖνα θαλάσσης, αἶψα δὲ νῆα μέλαιναν ἐπʼ ἠπείροιο ἔρυσσαν, τεύχεα δέ σφʼ ἀπένεικαν ὑπέρθυμοι θεράποντες. αὐτοὶ δʼ εἰς ἀγορὴν κίον ἀθρόοι, οὐδέ τινʼ ἄλλον εἴων οὔτε νέων μεταΐζειν οὔτε γερόντων. τοῖσιν δʼ Ἀντίνοος μετέφη, Εὐπείθεος υἱός·
"""Good heavens,"" said he, ""see how the gods have saved this man from destruction. We kept a succession of scouts upon the headlands all day long, and when the sun was down we never went on shore to sleep, but waited in the ship all night till morning in the hope of capturing and killing him; but some has conveyed him home in spite of us. Let us consider how we can make an end of him. He must not escape us; our affair is never likely to come off while is alive, for he is very shrewd in , and public feeling is by no means all on our side. We must make haste before he can call the Achaeans in assembly; he will lose no time in doing so, for he will be furious with us, and will tell all the world how we plotted to kill him, but failed to take him. The people will not like this when they come to know of it; we must see that they do us no hurt, nor drive us from our own into exile. Let us try and lay hold of him either on his farm away from the town, or on the road hither. Then we can divide up his property amongst us, and let his mother and the man who marries her have the house. If this does not please you, and you wish Telemakhos to live on and hold his father's property, then we must not gather here and eat up his goods in this way, but must make our offers to Penelope each from his own house, and she can marry the man who will give the most for her, and whose lot it is to win her."""	ὢ πόποι, ὡς τόνδʼ ἄνδρα θεοὶ κακότητος ἔλυσαν. ἤματα μὲν σκοποὶ ἷζον ἐπʼ ἄκριας ἠνεμοέσσας αἰὲν ἐπασσύτεροι· ἅμα δʼ ἠελίῳ καταδύντι οὔ ποτʼ ἐπʼ ἠπείρου νύκτʼ ἄσαμεν, ἀλλʼ ἐνὶ πόντῳ νηῒ θοῇ πλείοντες ἐμίμνομεν Ἠῶ δῖαν, Τηλέμαχον λοχόωντες, ἵνα φθίσωμεν ἑλόντες αὐτόν· τὸν δʼ ἄρα τῆος ἀπήγαγεν οἴκαδε δαίμων, ἡμεῖς δʼ ἐνθάδε οἱ φραζώμεθα λυγρὸν ὄλεθρον Τηλεμάχῳ, μηδʼ ἧμας ὑπεκφύγοι· οὐ γὰρ ὀΐω τούτου γε ζώοντος ἀνύσσεσθαι τάδε ἔργα. αὐτὸς μὲν γὰρ ἐπιστήμων βουλῇ τε νόῳ τε, λαοὶ δʼ οὐκέτι πάμπαν ἐφʼ ἡμῖν ἦρα φέρουσιν. ἀλλʼ ἄγετε, πρὶν κεῖνον ὁμηγυρίσασθαι Ἀχαιοὺς εἰς ἀγορήν—οὐ γάρ τι μεθησέμεναί μιν ὀΐω, ἀλλʼ ἀπομηνίσει, ἐρέει δʼ ἐν πᾶσιν ἀναστὰς οὕνεκά οἱ φόνον αἰπὺν ἐράπτομεν οὐδʼ ἐκίχημεν· οἱ δʼ οὐκ αἰνήσουσιν ἀκούοντες κακὰ ἔργα· μή τι κακὸν ῥέξωσι καὶ ἡμέας ἐξελάσωσι γαίης ἡμετέρης, ἄλλων δʼ ἀφικώμεθα δῆμον· ἀλλὰ φθέωμεν ἑλόντες ἐπʼ ἀγροῦ νόσφι πόληος ἢ ἐν ὁδῷ· βίοτον δʼ αὐτοὶ καὶ κτήματʼ ἔχωμεν, δασσάμενοι κατὰ μοῖραν ἐφʼ ἡμέας, οἰκία δʼ αὖτε κείνου μητέρι δοῖμεν ἔχειν ἠδʼ ὅστις ὀπυίοι. εἰ δʼ ὑμῖν ὅδε μῦθος ἀφανδάνει, ἀλλὰ βόλεσθε αὐτόν τε ζώειν καὶ ἔχειν πατρώϊα πάντα, μή οἱ χρήματʼ ἔπειτα ἅλις θυμηδέʼ ἔδωμεν ἐνθάδʼ ἀγειρόμενοι, ἀλλʼ ἐκ μεγάροιο ἕκαστος μνάσθω ἐέδνοισιν διζήμενος· ἡ δέ κʼ ἔπειτα γήμαιθʼ ὅς κε πλεῖστα πόροι καὶ μόρσιμος ἔλθοι.
"They all held their peace until Amphinomos rose to speak. He was the son of Nisus, who was son to king Aretias, and he was foremost among all the suitors from the wheat-growing and well grassed island of Dulichium; his conversation, moreover, was more agreeable to Penelope than that of any of the other for he was a man of good natural disposition. ""My friends,"" said he, speaking to them plainly and in all honestly, ""I am not in favor of killing Telemakhos. It is a heinous thing to kill one who is of noble blood. Let us first take counsel of the gods, and if the oracles of Zeus advise it, I will both help to kill him myself, and will urge everyone else to do so; but if they dissuade us, I would have you hold your hands."""	ὣς ἔφαθʼ, οἱ δʼ ἄρα πάντες ἀκὴν ἐγένοντο σιωπῇ. τοῖσιν δʼ Ἀμφίνομος ἀγορήσατο καὶ μετέειπε, Νίσου φαίδιμος υἱός, Ἀρητιάδαο ἄνακτος, ὅς ῥʼ ἐκ Δουλιχίου πολυπύρου, ποιήεντος, ἡγεῖτο μνηστῆρσι, μάλιστα δὲ Πηνελοπείῃ ἥνδανε μύθοισι· φρεσὶ γὰρ κέχρητʼ ἀγαθῇσιν· ὅ σφιν ἐϋφρονέων ἀγορήσατο καὶ μετέειπεν· ὦ φίλοι, οὐκ ἂν ἐγώ γε κατακτείνειν ἐθέλοιμι Τηλέμαχον· δεινὸν δὲ γένος βασιλήϊόν ἐστιν κτείνειν· ἀλλὰ πρῶτα θεῶν εἰρώμεθα βουλάς. εἰ μέν κʼ αἰνήσωσι Διὸς μεγάλοιο θέμιστες, αὐτός τε κτενέω τούς τʼ ἄλλους πάντας ἀνώξω· εἰ δέ κʼ ἀποτρωπῶσι θεοί, παύσασθαι ἄνωγα.
Thus did he speak, and his words pleased them well, so they rose forthwith and went to the house of Odysseus where they took their accustomed seats.	ὣς ἔφατʼ Ἀμφίνομος, τοῖσιν δʼ ἐπιήνδανε μῦθος. αὐτίκʼ ἔπειτʼ ἀνστάντες ἔβαν δόμον εἰς Ὀδυσῆος, ἐλθόντες δὲ καθῖζον ἐπὶ ξεστοῖσι θρόνοισιν.
Then Penelope resolved that she would show herself to the outrageous   suitors. She knew of the plot against Telemakhos, for the servant Medon had overheard their counsels and had told her; she went down therefore to the court attended by her maidens, and when she reached the suitors she stood by one of the bearing-posts supporting the roof of the room holding a veil before her face, and rebuked Antinoos saying:	ἡ δʼ αὖτʼ ἄλλʼ ἐνόησε περίφρων Πηνελόπεια, μνηστήρεσσι φανῆναι ὑπέρβιον ὕβριν ἔχουσι. πεύθετο γὰρ οὗ παιδὸς ἐνὶ μεγάροισιν ὄλεθρον· κῆρυξ γὰρ οἱ ἔειπε Μέδων, ὃς ἐπεύθετο βουλάς. βῆ δʼ ἰέναι μέγαρόνδε σὺν ἀμφιπόλοισι γυναιξίν. ἀλλʼ ὅτε δὴ μνηστῆρας ἀφίκετο δῖα γυναικῶν, στῆ ῥα παρὰ σταθμὸν τέγεος πύκα ποιητοῖο, ἄντα παρειάων σχομένη λιπαρὰ κρήδεμνα,
"""Antinoos, insolent   and wicked schemer, they say you are the best speaker and counselor of any man your own age in the of Ithaca , but you are nothing of the kind. Madman, why should you try to compass the death of Telemakhos, and take no heed of suppliants, whose witness is Zeus himself? It is not right for you to plot thus against one another. Do you not remember how your father fled to this house in fear of the people  , who were enraged against him for having gone with some Taphian pirates and plundered the Thesprotians who were at peace with us? They wanted to tear him in pieces and eat up everything he had, but Odysseus stayed their hands although they were infuriated, and now you devour his property without paying for it, and break my heart by wooing his wife and trying to kill his son. Leave off doing so, and stop the others also."""

"To this Eurymakhos son of Polybos answered, ""Take heart, Queen Penelope daughter of Ikarios, and do not trouble yourself about these matters. The man is not yet born, nor never will be, who shall lay hands upon your son Telemakhos, while I yet live to look upon the face of the earth. I say - and it shall surely be - that my spear shall be reddened with his blood; for many a time has Odysseus taken me on his knees, held wine up to my lips to drink, and put pieces of meat into my hands. Therefore Telemakhos is much the dearest friend I have, and has nothing to fear from the hands of us suitors. Of course, if death comes to him from the gods, he cannot escape it."" He said this to quiet her, but in reality he was plotting against Telemakhos."	τὴν δʼ αὖτʼ Εὐρύμαχος, Πολύβου πάϊς, ἀντίον ηὔδα· κούρη Ἰκαρίοιο, περίφρον Πηνελόπεια, θάρσει· μή τοι ταῦτα μετὰ φρεσὶ σῇσι μελόντων. οὐκ ἔσθʼ οὗτος ἀνὴρ οὐδʼ ἔσσεται οὐδὲ γένηται, ὅς κεν Τηλεμάχῳ σῷ υἱέϊ χεῖρας ἐποίσει ζώοντός γʼ ἐμέθεν καὶ ἐπὶ χθονὶ δερκομένοιο. ὧδε γὰρ ἐξερέω, καὶ μὴν τετελεσμένον ἔσται· αἶψά οἱ αἷμα κελαινὸν ἐρωήσει περὶ δουρὶ ἡμετέρῳ, ἐπεὶ ἦ καὶ ἐμὲ πτολίπορθος Ὀδυσσεὺς πολλάκι γούνασιν οἷσιν ἐφεσσάμενος κρέας ὀπτὸν ἐν χείρεσσιν ἔθηκεν, ἐπέσχε τε οἶνον ἐρυθρόν. τῷ μοι Τηλέμαχος πάντων πολὺ φίλτατός ἐστιν ἀνδρῶν, οὐδέ τί μιν θάνατον τρομέεσθαι ἄνωγα ἔκ γε μνηστήρων· θεόθεν δʼ οὐκ ἔστʼ ἀλέασθαι. ὣς φάτο θαρσύνων, τῷ δʼ ἤρτυεν αὐτὸς ὄλεθρον.
Then Penelope went upstairs again and mourned her husband till Athena shed sleep over her eyes. In the evening Eumaios got back to Odysseus and his son, who had just sacrificed a young pig of a year old and were ready; helping one another to get supper ready; Athena therefore came up to Odysseus, turned him into an old man with a stroke of her wand, and clad him in his old clothes again, for fear that the swineherd might recognize him and not keep the secret, but go and tell Penelope.	ἡ μὲν ἄρʼ εἰσαναβᾶσʼ ὑπερώϊα σιγαλόεντα κλαῖεν ἔπειτʼ Ὀδυσῆα, φίλον πόσιν, ὄφρα οἱ ὕπνον ἡδὺν ἐπὶ βλεφάροισι βάλε γλαυκῶπις Ἀθήνη. ἑσπέριος δʼ Ὀδυσῆϊ καὶ υἱέϊ δῖος ὑφορβὸς ἤλυθεν· οἱ δʼ ἄρα δόρπον ἐπισταδὸν ὡπλίζοντο, σῦν ἱερεύσαντες ἐνιαύσιον. αὐτὰρ Ἀθήνη, ἄγχι παρισταμένη, Λαερτιάδην Ὀδυσῆα ῥάβδῳ πεπληγυῖα πάλιν ποίησε γέροντα, λυγρὰ δὲ εἵματα ἕσσε περὶ χροΐ, μή ἑ συβώτης γνοίη ἐσάντα ἰδὼν καὶ ἐχέφρονι Πηνελοπείῃ ἔλθοι ἀπαγγέλλων μηδὲ φρεσὶν εἰρύσσαιτο.
"Telemakhos was the first to speak. ""So you have got back, Eumaios,"" said he. ""What is the news   of the town? Have the suitors returned, or are they still waiting over yonder, to take me on my way home?"""	τὸν καὶ Τηλέμαχος πρότερος πρὸς μῦθον ἔειπεν· ἦλθες, δῖʼ Εὔμαιε. τί δὴ κλέος ἔστʼ ἀνὰ ἄστυ; ἦ ῥʼ ἤδη μνηστῆρες ἀγήνορες ἔνδον ἔασιν ἐκ λόχου, ἦ ἔτι μʼ αὖτʼ εἰρύαται οἴκαδʼ ἰόντα;
"""I did not think of asking about that,"" replied Eumaios, ""when I was in the town. I thought I would give my message and come back as soon as I could. I met a man sent by those who had gone with you to Pylos , and he was the first to tell the new your mother, but I can say what I saw with my own eyes; I had just got on to the crest of the hill of Hermes above the town when I saw a ship coming into harbor with a number of men in her. They had many shields and spears, and I thought it was the suitors, but I cannot be sure."""	τὸν δʼ ἀπαμειβόμενος προσέφης, Εὔμαιε συβῶτα· οὐκ ἔμελέν μοι ταῦτα μεταλλῆσαι καὶ ἐρέσθαι ἄστυ καταβλώσκοντα· τάχιστά με θυμὸς ἀνώγει ἀγγελίην εἰπόντα πάλιν δεῦρʼ ἀπονέεσθαι. ὡμήρησε δέ μοι παρʼ ἑταίρων ἄγγελος ὠκύς, κῆρυξ, ὃς δὴ πρῶτος ἔπος σῇ μητρὶ ἔειπεν. ἄλλο δέ τοι τό γε οἶδα· τὸ γὰρ ἴδον ὀφθαλμοῖσιν. ἤδη ὑπὲρ πόλιος, ὅθι θʼ Ἕρμαιος λόφος ἐστίν, ἦα κιών, ὅτε νῆα θοὴν ἰδόμην κατιοῦσαν ἐς λιμένʼ ἡμέτερον· πολλοὶ δʼ ἔσαν ἄνδρες ἐν αὐτῇ, βεβρίθει δὲ σάκεσσι καὶ ἔγχεσιν ἀμφιγύοισι· καὶ σφέας ὠΐσθην τοὺς ἔμμεναι, οὐδέ τι οἶδα.
On hearing this Telemakhos smiled to his father, but so that Eumaios could not see him.	ὣς φάτο, μείδησεν δʼ ἱερὴ ἲς Τηλεμάχοιο ἐς πατέρʼ ὀφθαλμοῖσιν ἰδών, ἀλέεινε δʼ ὑφορβόν.
Then, when they had finished their labor   and the meal was ready, they ate it, and every man had his full share so that all were satisfied. As soon as they had had enough to eat and drink, they laid down to rest and enjoyed the boon of sleep.	οἱ δʼ ἐπεὶ οὖν παύσαντο πόνου τετύκοντό τε δαῖτα, δαίνυντʼ, οὐδέ τι θυμὸς ἐδεύετο δαιτὸς ἐΐσης. αὐτὰρ ἐπεὶ πόσιος καὶ ἐδητύος ἐξ ἔρον ἕντο,
"When the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared, Telemakhos bound on his sandals and took a strong spear that suited his hands, for he wanted to go into the city. ""Old friend,"" said he to the swineherd, ""I will now go to the town and show myself to my mother, for she will never leave off grieving till she has seen me. As for this unfortunate stranger, take him to the town and let him beg there of any one who will give him a drink and a piece of bread. I have trouble enough of my own, and cannot be burdened with other people. If this makes him angry so much the worse for him, but I like to tell the truth  ."""	ἦμος δʼ ἠριγένεια φάνη ῥοδοδάκτυλος Ἠώς, δὴ τότʼ ἔπειθʼ ὑπὸ ποσσὶν ἐδήσατο καλὰ πέδιλα Τηλέμαχος, φίλος υἱὸς Ὀδυσσῆος θείοιο, εἵλετο δʼ ἄλκιμον ἔγχος, ὅ οἱ παλάμηφιν ἀρήρει, ἄστυδε ἱέμενος, καὶ ἑὸν προσέειπε συβώτην· ἄττʼ, ἦ τοι μὲν ἐγὼν εἶμʼ ἐς πόλιν, ὄφρα με μήτηρ ὄψεται· οὐ γάρ μιν πρόσθεν παύσεσθαι ὀΐω κλαυθμοῦ τε στυγεροῖο γόοιό τε δακρυόεντος, πρίν γʼ αὐτόν με ἴδηται· ἀτὰρ σοί γʼ ὧδʼ ἐπιτέλλω. τὸν ξεῖνον δύστηνον ἄγʼ ἐς πόλιν, ὄφρʼ ἂν ἐκεῖθι δαῖτα πτωχεύῃ· δώσει δέ οἱ ὅς κʼ ἐθέλῃσι πύρνον καὶ κοτύλην· ἐμὲ δʼ οὔ πως ἔστιν ἅπαντας ἀνθρώπους ἀνέχεσθαι, ἔχοντά περ ἄλγεα θυμῷ· ὁ ξεῖνος δʼ εἴ περ μάλα μηνίει, ἄλγιον αὐτῷ ἔσσεται· ἦ γὰρ ἐμοὶ φίλʼ ἀληθέα μυθήσασθαι.
"Then Odysseus said, ""Sir, I do not want to stay here; a beggar can always do better in town than country, for any one who likes can give him something. I am too old to care about remaining here at the beck and call of a master. Therefore let this man do as you have just told him, and take me to the town as soon as I have had a warm by the fire, and the day has got a little heat in it. My clothes are wretchedly thin, and this frosty morning I shall be perished with cold, for you say the city is some way off."""	τὸν δʼ ἀπαμειβόμενος προσέφη πολύμητις Ὀδυσσεύς· ὦ φίλος, οὐδέ τοι αὐτὸς ἐρύκεσθαι μενεαίνω· πτωχῷ βέλτερόν ἐστι κατὰ πτόλιν ἠὲ κατʼ ἀγροὺς δαῖτα πτωχεύειν· δώσει δέ μοι ὅς κʼ ἐθέλῃσιν. οὐ γὰρ ἐπὶ σταθμοῖσι μένειν ἔτι τηλίκος εἰμί, ὥστʼ ἐπιτειλαμένῳ σημάντορι πάντα πιθέσθαι. ἀλλʼ ἔρχευ· ἐμὲ δʼ ἄξει ἀνὴρ ὅδε, τὸν σὺ κελεύεις, αὐτίκʼ ἐπεί κε πυρὸς θερέω ἀλέη τε γένηται. αἰνῶς γὰρ τάδε εἵματʼ ἔχω κακά· μή με δαμάσσῃ στίβη ὑπηοίη· ἕκαθεν δέ τε ἄστυ φάτʼ εἶναι.
On this Telemakhos strode off through the yards, brooding his revenge upon the When he reached home he stood his spear against a bearing-post of the room, crossed the stone floor of the room itself, and went inside.	ὣς φάτο, Τηλέμαχος δὲ διὰ σταθμοῖο βεβήκει, κραιπνὰ ποσὶ προβιβάς, κακὰ δὲ μνηστῆρσι φύτευεν. αὐτὰρ ἐπεί ῥʼ ἵκανε δόμους εὖ ναιετάοντας, ἔγχος μέν ῥʼ ἔστησε φέρων πρὸς κίονα μακρήν, αὐτὸς δʼ εἴσω ἴεν καὶ ὑπέρβη λάϊνον οὐδόν.
"Nurse Eurykleia saw him long before any one else did. She was putting the fleeces on to the seats, and she burst out crying as she ran up to him; all the other maids came up too, and covered his head and shoulders with their kisses. Penelope came out of her room looking like Artemis or Aphrodite, and wept as she flung her arms about her son. She kissed his forehead and both his beautiful eyes, ""Light of my eyes,"" she cried as she spoke fondly to him, ""so you are come home again; I made sure I was never going to see you any more. To think of your having gone off to Pylos without saying anything about it or obtaining my consent. But come, tell me what you saw."""	τὸν δὲ πολὺ πρώτη εἶδε τροφὸς Εὐρύκλεια, κώεα καστορνῦσα θρόνοις ἔνι δαιδαλέοισι, δακρύσασα δʼ ἔπειτʼ ἰθὺς κίεν· ἀμφὶ δʼ ἄρʼ ἄλλαι δμῳαὶ Ὀδυσσῆος ταλασίφρονος ἠγερέθοντο, καὶ κύνεον ἀγαπαζόμεναι κεφαλήν τε καὶ ὤμους. ἡ δʼ ἴεν ἐκ θαλάμοιο περίφρων Πηνελόπεια, Ἀρτέμιδι ἰκέλη ἠὲ χρυσέῃ Ἀφροδίτῃ, ἀμφὶ δὲ παιδὶ φίλῳ βάλε πήχεε δακρύσασα, κύσσε δέ μιν κεφαλήν τε καὶ ἄμφω φάεα καλά, καί ῥʼ ὀλοφυρομένη ἔπεα πτερόεντα προσηύδα· ἦλθες, Τηλέμαχε, γλυκερὸν φάος. οὔ σʼ ἔτʼ ἐγώ γε ὄψεσθαι ἐφάμην, ἐπεὶ ᾤχεο νηῒ Πύλονδε λάθρη, ἐμεῦ ἀέκητι, φίλου μετὰ πατρὸς ἀκουήν. ἀλλʼ ἄγε μοι κατάλεξον ὅπως ἤντησας ὀπωπῆς.
"""Do not scold me, mother,’ answered Telemakhos, ""nor vex me, seeing what a narrow escape I have had, but wash your face, change your dress, go upstairs with your maids, and promise full and sufficient hecatombs to all the gods if Zeus will only grant us our revenge upon the suitors. I must now go to the place of assembly to invite a stranger who has come back with me from Pylos . I sent him on with my crew, and told Peiraios to take him home and look after him till I could come for him myself."""	τὴν δʼ αὖ Τηλέμαχος πεπνυμένος ἀντίον ηὔδα· μῆτερ ἐμή, μή μοι γόον ὄρνυθι μηδέ μοι ἦτορ ἐν στήθεσσιν ὄρινε φυγόντι περ αἰπὺν ὄλεθρον· ἀλλʼ ὑδρηναμένη, καθαρὰ χροῒ εἵμαθʼ ἑλοῦσα, εἰς ὑπερῷʼ ἀναβᾶσα σὺν ἀμφιπόλοισι γυναιξὶν εὔχεο πᾶσι θεοῖσι τεληέσσας ἑκατόμβας ῥέξειν, αἴ κέ ποθι Ζεὺς ἄντιτα ἔργα τελέσσῃ. αὐτὰρ ἐγὼν ἀγορὴν ἐσελεύσομαι, ὄφρα καλέσσω ξεῖνον, ὅτις μοι κεῖθεν ἅμʼ ἕσπετο δεῦρο κιόντι. τὸν μὲν ἐγὼ προὔπεμψα σὺν ἀντιθέοις ἑτάροισι, Πείραιον δέ μιν ἠνώγεα προτὶ οἶκον ἄγοντα ἐνδυκέως φιλέειν καὶ τιέμεν, εἰς ὅ κεν ἔλθω.
She heeded her son's words, washed her face, changed her dress, and vowed full and sufficient hecatombs to all the gods if they would only grant her revenge upon the suitors.	ὣς ἄρʼ ἐφώνησεν, τῇ δʼ ἄπτερος ἔπλετο μῦθος. ἡ δʼ ὑδρηναμένη, καθαρὰ χροῒ εἵμαθʼ ἑλοῦσα, εὔχετο πᾶσι θεοῖσι τεληέσσας ἑκατόμβας ῥέξειν, αἴ κέ ποθι Ζεὺς ἄντιτα ἔργα τελέσσῃ.
"Telemakhos went through, and out of, the cloisters spear in hand - not alone, for his two fleet dogs went with him. Athena endowed him with a presence of such divine comeliness   that all marveled at him as he went by, and the suitors gathered round him with fair words in their mouths and malice in their hearts; but he avoided them, and went to sit with Mentor, Antiphos, and Halitherses, old friends of his father's house, and they made him tell them all that had happened to him. Then Peiraios came up with Theoklymenos, whom he had escorted through the town to the place of assembly, whereon Telemakhos at once joined them. Peiraios was first to speak: ""Telemakhos,"" said he, ""I wish you would send some of your women to my house to take away the presents Menelaos gave you."""

"""We do not know, Peiraios,"" answered Telemakhos, ""what may happen. If the suitors kill me in my own house and divide my property among them, I would rather you had the presents than that any of those people should get hold of them. If on the other hand I manage to kill them, I shall be much obliged if you will kindly bring me my presents."""	τὸν δʼ αὖ Τηλέμαχος πεπνυμένος ἀντίον ηὔδα· Πείραιʼ, οὐ γάρ τʼ ἴδμεν ὅπως ἔσται τάδε ἔργα. εἴ κεν ἐμὲ μνηστῆρες ἀγήνορες ἐν μεγάροισι λάθρη κτείναντες πατρώϊα πάντα δάσωνται, αὐτὸν ἔχοντά σε βούλομʼ ἐπαυρέμεν, ἤ τινα τῶνδε· εἰ δέ κʼ ἐγὼ τούτοισι φόνον καὶ κῆρα φυτεύσω, δὴ τότε μοι χαίροντι φέρειν πρὸς δώματα χαίρων.
With these words he took Theoklymenos to his own house. When they got there they laid their cloaks on the benches and seats, went into the baths, and washed themselves. When the maids had washed and anointed them, and had given them cloaks and shirts, they took their seats at table. A maid servant then brought them water in a beautiful golden ewer, and poured it into a silver basin for them to wash their hands; and she drew a clean table beside them. An upper servant brought them bread and offered them many good things of what there was in the house. Opposite them sat Penelope, reclining on a couch by one of the bearing-posts of the room, and spinning. Then they laid their hands on the good things that were before them, and as soon as they had had enough to eat and drink Penelope said:	ὣς εἰπὼν ξεῖνον ταλαπείριον ἦγεν ἐς οἶκον. αὐτὰρ ἐπεί ῥʼ ἵκοντο δόμους εὖ ναιετάοντας, χλαίνας μὲν κατέθεντο κατὰ κλισμούς τε θρόνους τε, ἐς δʼ ἀσαμίνθους βάντες ἐϋξέστας λούσαντο. τοὺς δʼ ἐπεὶ οὖν δμῳαὶ λοῦσαν καὶ χρῖσαν ἐλαίῳ, ἀμφὶ δʼ ἄρα χλαίνας οὔλας βάλον ἠδὲ χιτῶνας, ἔκ ῥʼ ἀσαμίνθων βάντες ἐπὶ κλισμοῖσι καθῖζον. χέρνιβα δʼ ἀμφίπολος προχόῳ ἐπέχευε φέρουσα καλῇ χρυσείῃ, ὑπὲρ ἀργυρέοιο λέβητος, νίψασθαι· παρὰ δὲ ξεστὴν ἐτάνυσσε τράπεζαν. σῖτον δʼ αἰδοίη ταμίη παρέθηκε φέρουσα, εἴδατα πόλλʼ ἐπιθεῖσα, χαριζομένη παρεόντων. μήτηρ δʼ ἀντίον ἷζε παρὰ σταθμὸν μεγάροιο κλισμῷ κεκλιμένη, λέπτʼ ἠλάκατα στρωφῶσα. οἱ δʼ ἐπʼ ὀνείαθʼ ἑτοῖμα προκείμενα χεῖρας ἴαλλον, αὐτὰρ ἐπεὶ πόσιος καὶ ἐδητύος ἐξ ἔρον ἕντο, τοῖσι δὲ μύθων ἦρχε περίφρων Πηνελόπεια·
"""Telemakhos, I shall go upstairs and lie down on that sad couch, which I have not ceased to water with my tears, from the day Odysseus set out for Troy with the sons of Atreus. You failed, however, to make it clear to me before the suitors came back to the house, whether or not you had been able to hear anything about the return   of your father."""

"""I will tell you then truth  ,"" replied her son. ""We went to Pylos and saw Nestor, who took me to his house and treated me as hospitably as though I were a son of his own who had just returned after a long absence; so also did his sons; but he said he had not heard a word from any human being about Odysseus, whether he was alive or dead. He sent me, therefore, with a chariot and horses to Menelaos. There I saw Helen, for whose sake so many, both Argives and Trojans, were in heaven's wisdom doomed to suffer. Menelaos asked me what it was that had brought me to Lacedaemon , and I told him the whole truth  , whereon he said, ‘So, then, these cowards would usurp a brave man's bed? A hind might as well lay her new-born young in the lair of a lion, and then go off to feed in the forest or in some grassy dell. The lion, when he comes back to his lair, will make short work with the pair of them, and so will Odysseus with these suitors. By father Zeus, Athena, and Apollo, if Odysseus is still the man that he was when he wrestled with Philomeleides in Lesbos , and threw him so heavily that all the Greeks cheered him - if he is still such, and were to come near these suitors, they would have a swift doom and a sorry wedding. As regards your question, however, I will not prevaricate nor deceive you, but what the old man of the sea told me, so much will I tell you in full. He said he could see Odysseus on an island sorrowing bitterly in the house of the nymph Calypso, who was keeping him prisoner, and he could not reach his home, for he had no ships nor sailors to take him over the sea.’ This was what Menelaos told me, and when I had heard his story I came away; the gods then gave me a fair wind and soon brought me safe home again."""	νόστον σοῦ πατρὸς σάφα εἰπέμεν, εἴ που ἄκουσας. τὴν δʼ αὖ Τηλέμαχος πεπνυμένος ἀντίον ηὔδα· τοιγὰρ ἐγώ τοι, μῆτερ, ἀληθείην καταλέξω. ᾠχόμεθʼ ἔς τε Πύλον καὶ Νέστορα, ποιμένα λαῶν· δεξάμενος δέ με κεῖνος ἐν ὑψηλοῖσι δόμοισιν ἐνδυκέως ἐφίλει, ὡς εἴ τε πατὴρ ἑὸν υἱὸν ἐλθόντα χρόνιον νέον ἄλλοθεν· ὣς ἐμὲ κεῖνος ἐνδυκέως ἐκόμιζε σὺν υἱάσι κυδαλίμοισιν. αὐτὰρ Ὀδυσσῆος ταλασίφρονος οὔ ποτʼ ἔφασκεν, ζωοῦ οὐδὲ θανόντος, ἐπιχθονίων τευ ἀκοῦσαι· ἀλλά μʼ ἐς Ἀτρεΐδην, δουρικλειτὸν Μενέλαον, ἵπποισι προὔπεμψε καὶ ἅρμασι κολλητοῖσιν. ἔνθʼ ἴδον Ἀργείην Ἑλένην, ἧς εἵνεκα πολλὰ Ἀργεῖοι Τρῶές τε θεῶν ἰότητι μόγησαν. εἴρετο δʼ αὐτίκʼ ἔπειτα βοὴν ἀγαθὸς Μενέλαος ὅττευ χρηΐζων ἱκόμην Λακεδαίμονα δῖαν· αὐτὰρ ἐγὼ τῷ πᾶσαν ἀληθείην κατέλεξα· καὶ τότε δή με ἔπεσσιν ἀμειβόμενος προσέειπεν· ὢ πόποι, ἦ μάλα δὴ κρατερόφρονος ἀνδρὸς ἐν εὐνῇ ἤθελον εὐνηθῆναι, ἀνάλκιδες αὐτοὶ ἐόντες. ὡς δʼ ὁπότʼ ἐν ξυλόχῳ ἔλαφος κρατεροῖο λέοντος νεβροὺς κοιμήσασα νεηγενέας γαλαθηνοὺς κνημοὺς ἐξερέῃσι καὶ ἄγκεα ποιήεντα βοσκομένη, ὁ δʼ ἔπειτα ἑὴν εἰσήλυθεν εὐνήν, ἀμφοτέροισι δὲ τοῖσιν ἀεικέα πότμον ἐφῆκεν, ὣς Ὀδυσεὺς κείνοισιν ἀεικέα πότμον ἐφήσει. αἲ γάρ, Ζεῦ τε πάτερ καὶ Ἀθηναίη καὶ Ἄπολλον, τοῖος ἐὼν οἷός ποτʼ ἐϋκτιμένῃ ἐνὶ Λέσβῳ ἐξ ἔριδος Φιλομηλεΐδῃ ἐπάλαισεν ἀναστάς, κὰδ δʼ ἔβαλε κρατερῶς, κεχάροντο δὲ πάντες Ἀχαιοί, τοῖος ἐὼν μνηστῆρσιν ὁμιλήσειεν Ὀδυσσεύς· πάντες κʼ ὠκύμοροί τε γενοίατο πικρόγαμοί τε. ταῦτα δʼ ἅ μʼ εἰρωτᾷς καὶ λίσσεαι, οὐκ ἂν ἐγώ γε ἄλλα παρὲξ εἴποιμι παρακλιδὸν οὐδʼ ἀπατήσω, ἀλλὰ τὰ μέν μοι ἔειπε γέρων ἅλιος νημερτής, τῶν οὐδέν τοι ἐγὼ κρύψω ἔπος οὐδʼ ἐπικεύσω. φῆ μιν ὅ γʼ ἐν νήσῳ ἰδέειν κρατέρʼ ἄλγεʼ ἔχοντα, νύμφης ἐν μεγάροισι Καλυψοῦς, ἥ μιν ἀνάγκῃ ἴσχει· ὁ δʼ οὐ δύναται ἣν πατρίδα γαῖαν ἱκέσθαι. οὐ γάρ οἱ πάρα νῆες ἐπήρετμοι καὶ ἑταῖροι, οἵ κέν μιν πέμποιεν ἐπʼ εὐρέα νῶτα θαλάσσης ὣς ἔφατʼ Ἀτρεΐδης, δουρικλειτὸς Μενέλαος. ταῦτα τελευτήσας νεόμην· ἔδοσαν δέ μοι οὖρον ἀθάνατοι, τοί μʼ ὦκα φίλην ἐς πατρίδʼ ἔπεμψαν.
With these words he moved the heart of Penelope. Then Theoklymenos said to her:	ὣς φάτο, τῇ δʼ ἄρα θυμὸν ἐνὶ στήθεσσιν ὄρινε. τοῖσι δὲ καὶ μετέειπε Θεοκλύμενος θεοειδής·
"""My lady, wife of Odysseus, Telemakhos does not understand these things; listen therefore to me, for I can divine them surely, and will hide nothing from you. May Zeus the king of heaven be my witness, and the rites of hospitality, with that hearth of Odysseus to which I now come, that Odysseus himself is even now in Ithaca , and, either going about the country or staying in one place, is inquiring into all these evil deeds and preparing a day of reckoning for the suitors. I saw an omen when I was on the ship which meant this, and I told Telemakhos about it."""	ὦ γύναι αἰδοίη Λαερτιάδεω Ὀδυσῆος, ἦ τοι ὅ γʼ οὐ σάφα οἶδεν, ἐμεῖο δὲ σύνθεο μῦθον· ἀτρεκέως γάρ σοι μαντεύσομαι οὐδʼ ἐπικεύσω· ἴστω νῦν Ζεὺς πρῶτα θεῶν, ξενίη τε τράπεζα ἱστίη τʼ Ὀδυσῆος ἀμύμονος, ἣν ἀφικάνω, ὡς ἦ τοι Ὀδυσεὺς ἤδη ἐν πατρίδι γαίῃ, ἥμενος ἢ ἕρπων, τάδε πευθόμενος κακὰ ἔργα, ἔστιν, ἀτὰρ μνηστῆρσι κακὸν πάντεσσι φυτεύει· τοῖον ἐγὼν οἰωνὸν ἐϋσσέλμου ἐπὶ νηὸς ἥμενος ἐφρασάμην καὶ Τηλεμάχῳ ἐγεγώνευν.
"""May it be even so,"" answered Penelope; ""if your words come true, you shall have such gifts and such good will from me that all who see you shall congratulate you."""	τὸν δʼ αὖτε προσέειπε περίφρων Πηνελόπεια· αἲ γὰρ τοῦτο, ξεῖνε, ἔπος τετελεσμένον εἴη· τῷ κε τάχα γνοίης φιλότητά τε πολλά τε δῶρα ἐξ ἐμεῦ, ὡς ἄν τίς σε συναντόμενος μακαρίζοι.
"Thus did they converse. Meanwhile the suitors were throwing discs, or aiming with spears at a mark on the leveled ground in front of the house, and behaving with all their old insolence  . But when it was now time for dinner, and the flock of sheep and goats had come into the town from all the country round, with their shepherds as usual, then Medon, who was their favorite servant, and who waited upon them at table, said, ""Now then, my young masters, you have had enough sport  , so come inside that we may get dinner ready. Dinner is not a bad thing, at dinner time  ."""	ὣς οἱ μὲν τοιαῦτα πρὸς ἀλλήλους ἀγόρευον, μνηστῆρες δὲ πάροιθεν Ὀδυσσῆος μεγάροιο δίσκοισιν τέρποντο καὶ αἰγανέῃσιν ἱέντες, ἐν τυκτῷ δαπέδῳ, ὅθι περ πάρος ὕβριν ἔχοντες. ἀλλʼ ὅτε δὴ δείπνηστος ἔην καὶ ἐπήλυθε μῆλα πάντοθεν ἐξ ἀγρῶν, οἱ δʼ ἤγαγον οἳ τὸ πάρος περ, καὶ τότε δή σφιν ἔειπε Μέδων· ὃς γάρ ῥα μάλιστα ἥνδανε κηρύκων, καὶ σφιν παρεγίγνετο δαιτί· κοῦροι, ἐπεὶ δὴ πάντες ἐτέρφθητε φρένʼ ἀέθλοις, ἔρχεσθε πρὸς δώμαθʼ, ἵνʼ ἐντυνώμεθα δαῖτα· οὐ μὲν γάρ τι χέρειον ἐν ὥρῃ δεῖπνον ἑλέσθαι.
"They left their sports as he told them, and when they were within the house, they laid their cloaks on the benches and seats inside, and then sacrificed some sheep, goats, pigs, and a heifer, all of them fat and well grown. Thus they made ready for their meal. In the meantime Odysseus and the swineherd were about starting for the town, and the swineherd said, ""Stranger, I suppose you still want to go to town to-day, as my master said you were to do; for my own part I should have liked you to stay here as a station hand, but I must do as my master tells me, or he will scold me later on, and a scolding from one's master is a very serious thing. Let us then be off, for it is now broad day; it will be night again directly and then you will find it colder."""	ὣς ἔφαθʼ, οἱ δʼ ἀνστάντες ἔβαν πείθοντό τε μύθῳ. αὐτὰρ ἐπεί ῥʼ ἵκοντο δόμους εὖ ναιετάοντας, χλαίνας μὲν κατέθεντο κατὰ κλισμούς τε θρόνους τε, οἱ δʼ ἱέρευον ὄϊς μεγάλους καὶ πίονας αἶγας, ἵρευον δὲ σύας σιάλους καὶ βοῦν ἀγελαίην, δαῖτʼ ἐντυνόμενοι. τοὶ δʼ ἐξ ἀγροῖο πόλινδε ὠτρύνοντʼ Ὀδυσεύς τʼ ἰέναι καὶ δῖος ὑφορβός. τοῖσι δὲ μύθων ἦρχε συβώτης, ὄρχαμος ἀνδρῶν· ξεῖνʼ, ἐπεὶ ἂρ δὴ ἔπειτα πόλινδʼ ἰέναι μενεαίνεις σήμερον, ὡς ἐπέτελλεν ἄναξ ἐμός—ἦ σʼ ἂν ἐγώ γε αὐτοῦ βουλοίμην σταθμῶν ῥυτῆρα λιπέσθαι· ἀλλὰ τὸν αἰδέομαι καὶ δείδια, μή μοι ὀπίσσω νεικείῃ· χαλεπαὶ δέ τʼ ἀνάκτων εἰσὶν ὁμοκλαί— ἀλλʼ ἄγε νῦν ἴομεν· δὴ γὰρ μέμβλωκε μάλιστα ἦμαρ, ἀτὰρ τάχα τοι ποτὶ ἕσπερα ῥίγιον ἔσται.
"""I know, and understand you,"" replied Odysseus; ""you need say no more. Let us be going, but if you have a stick ready cut, let me have it to walk with, for you say the road is a very rough one."""	τὸν δʼ ἀπαμειβόμενος προσέφη πολύμητις Ὀδυσσεύς· γιγνώσκω, φρονέω· τά γε δὴ νοέοντι κελεύεις. ἀλλʼ ἴομεν, σὺ δʼ ἔπειτα διαμπερὲς ἡγεμόνευε. δὸς δέ μοι, εἴ ποθί τοι ῥόπαλον τετμημένον ἐστίν, σκηρίπτεσθʼ, ἐπεὶ ἦ φατʼ ἀρισφαλέʼ ἔμμεναι οὐδόν.
As he spoke he threw his shabby old tattered wallet over his shoulders, by the cord from which it hung, and Eumaios gave him a stick to his liking. The two then started, leaving the station in charge of the dogs and herdsmen who remained behind; the swineherd led the way and his master followed after, looking like some broken-down old tramp as he leaned upon his staff, and his clothes were all in rags. When they had got over the rough steep ground and were nearing the city, they reached the fountain from which the citizens drew their water. This had been made by Ithacus, Neritus, and Polyktor. There was a grove of water-loving poplars planted in a circle all round it, and the clear cold water came down to it from a rock high up, while above the fountain there was an altar to the nymphs, at which all wayfarers used to sacrifice. Here Melanthios son of Dolios overtook them as he was driving down some goats, the best in his flock, for the suitors’ dinner, and there were two shepherds with him. When he saw Eumaios and Odysseus he reviled them with outrageous and unseemly language, which made Odysseus very angry.	ἦ ῥα καὶ ἀμφʼ ὤμοισιν ἀεικέα βάλλετο πήρην, πυκνὰ ῥωγαλέην· ἐν δὲ στρόφος ἦεν ἀορτήρ· Εὔμαιος δʼ ἄρα οἱ σκῆπτρον θυμαρὲς ἔδωκε. τὼ βήτην, σταθμὸν δὲ κύνες καὶ βώτορες ἄνδρες ῥύατʼ ὄπισθε μένοντες· ὁ δʼ ἐς πόλιν ἦγεν ἄνακτα πτωχῷ λευγαλέῳ ἐναλίγκιον ἠδὲ γέροντι, σκηπτόμενον· τὰ δὲ λυγρὰ περὶ χροῒ εἵματα ἕστο. ἀλλʼ ὅτε δὴ στείχοντες ὁδὸν κάτα παιπαλόεσσαν ἄστεος ἐγγὺς ἔσαν καὶ ἐπὶ κρήνην ἀφίκοντο τυκτὴν καλλίροον, ὅθεν ὑδρεύοντο πολῖται, τὴν ποίησʼ Ἴθακος καὶ Νήριτος ἠδὲ Πολύκτωρ· ἀμφὶ δʼ ἄρʼ αἰγείρων ὑδατοτρεφέων ἦν ἄλσος, πάντοσε κυκλοτερές, κατὰ δὲ ψυχρὸν ῥέεν ὕδωρ ὑψόθεν ἐκ πέτρης· βωμὸς δʼ ἐφύπερθε τέτυκτο νυμφάων, ὅθι πάντες ἐπιρρέζεσκον ὁδῖται· ἔνθα σφέας ἐκίχανʼ υἱὸς Δολίοιο Μελανθεὺς αἶγας ἄγων, αἳ πᾶσι μετέπρεπον αἰπολίοισι, δεῖπνον μνηστήρεσσι· δύω δʼ ἅμʼ ἕποντο νομῆες. τοὺς δὲ ἰδὼν νείκεσσεν ἔπος τʼ ἔφατʼ ἔκ τʼ ὀνόμαζεν, ἔκπαγλον καὶ ἀεικές· ὄρινε δὲ κῆρ Ὀδυσῆος·
"""There you go,"" cried he, ""and a precious pair you are. See how heaven brings birds of the same feather to one another. Where, pray, master swineherd, are you taking this poor miserable object? It would make any one sick to see such a creature at table. A fellow like this never won a prize for anything in his life, but will go about rubbing his shoulders against every man's door post, and begging, not for swords and cauldrons like a man, but only for a few scraps not worth begging for. If you would give him to me for a hand on my station, he might do to clean out the folds, or bring a bit of sweet feed to the kids, and he could fatten his thighs as much as he pleased on whey; but he has taken to bad ways and will not go about any kind of work; he will do nothing but beg victuals all the over, to feed his insatiable belly. I say, therefore and it shall surely be - if he goes near Odysseus’ house he will get his head broken by the stools they will fling at him, till they turn him out."""	νῦν μὲν δὴ μάλα πάγχυ κακὸς κακὸν ἡγηλάζει, ὡς αἰεὶ τὸν ὁμοῖον ἄγει θεὸς ὡς τὸν ὁμοῖον. πῇ δὴ τόνδε μολοβρὸν ἄγεις, ἀμέγαρτε συβῶτα, πτωχὸν ἀνιηρόν δαιτῶν ἀπολυμαντῆρα; ὃς πολλῇς φλιῇσι παραστὰς θλίψεται ὤμους, αἰτίζων ἀκόλους, οὐκ ἄορας οὐδὲ λέβητας· τόν κʼ εἴ μοι δοίης σταθμῶν ῥυτῆρα γενέσθαι σηκοκόρον τʼ ἔμεναι θαλλόν τʼ ἐρίφοισι φορῆναι, καί κεν ὀρὸν πίνων μεγάλην ἐπιγουνίδα θεῖτο. ἀλλʼ ἐπεὶ οὖν δὴ ἔργα κάκʼ ἔμμαθεν, οὐκ ἐθελήσει ἔργον ἐποίχεσθαι, ἀλλὰ πτώσσων κατὰ δῆμον βούλεται αἰτίζων βόσκειν ἣν γαστέρʼ ἄναλτον. ἀλλʼ ἔκ τοι ἐρέω, τὸ δὲ καὶ τετελεσμένον ἔσται· αἴ κʼ ἔλθῃ πρὸς δώματʼ Ὀδυσσῆος θείοιο, πολλά οἱ ἀμφὶ κάρη σφέλα ἀνδρῶν ἐκ παλαμάων πλευραὶ ἀποτρίψουσι δόμον κάτα βαλλομένοιο.
On this, as he passed, he gave Odysseus a kick on the hip out of pure wantonness, but Odysseus stood firm, and did not budge from the path. For a moment he doubted whether or not to fly at Melanthios and kill him with his staff, or fling him to the ground and beat his brains out; he resolved, however, to endure it and keep himself in check, but the swineherd looked straight at Melanthios and rebuked him, lifting up his hands and praying to heaven as he did so.	ὣς φάτο, καὶ παριὼν λὰξ ἔνθορεν ἀφραδίῃσιν ἰσχίῳ· οὐδέ μιν ἐκτὸς ἀταρπιτοῦ ἐστυφέλιξεν, ἀλλʼ ἔμενʼ ἀσφαλέως· ὁ δὲ μερμήριξεν Ὀδυσσεὺς ἠὲ μεταΐξας ῥοπάλῳ ἐκ θυμὸν ἕλοιτο, ἦ πρὸς γῆν ἐλάσειε κάρη ἀμφουδὶς ἀείρας. ἀλλʼ ἐπετόλμησε, φρεσὶ δʼ ἔσχετο· τὸν δὲ συβώτης νείκεσʼ ἐσάντα ἰδών, μέγα δʼ εὔξατο χεῖρας ἀνασχών·
"""Fountain nymphs,"" he cried, ""children of Zeus, if ever Odysseus burned you thigh bones covered with fat whether of lambs or kids, grant my prayer that a may send him home. He would soon put an end to the swaggering threats with which such men as you go about insulting people- gadding all over the town while your flocks are going to ruin through bad shepherding."""	νύμφαι κρηναῖαι, κοῦραι Διός, εἴ ποτʼ Ὀδυσσεὺς ὔμμʼ ἐπὶ μηρίʼ ἔκηε, καλύψας πίονι δημῷ, ἀρνῶν ἠδʼ ἐρίφων, τόδε μοι κρηήνατʼ ἐέλδωρ, ὡς ἔλθοι μὲν κεῖνος ἀνήρ, ἀγάγοι δέ ἑ δαίμων· τῷ κέ τοι ἀγλαΐας γε διασκεδάσειεν ἁπάσας, τὰς νῦν ὑβρίζων φορέεις, ἀλαλήμενος αἰεὶ ἄστυ κάτʼ· αὐτὰρ μῆλα κακοὶ φθείρουσι νομῆες.
"Then Melanthios the goatherd answered, ""You ill-conditioned cur, what are you talking about? Some day or other I will put you on board ship and take you to a foreign country, where I can sell you and keep the wealth you will fetch. I wish I were as sure that Apollo would strike Telemakhos dead this very day, or that the suitors would kill him, as I am that Odysseus will never come home again."""	τὸν δʼ αὖτε προσέειπε Μελάνθιος, αἰπόλος αἰγῶν· ὢ πόποι, οἶον ἔειπε κύων ὀλοφώϊα εἰδώς, τόν ποτʼ ἐγὼν ἐπὶ νηὸς ἐϋσσέλμοιο μελαίνης ἄξω τῆλʼ Ἰθάκης, ἵνα μοι βίοτον πολὺν ἄλφοι. αἲ γὰρ Τηλέμαχον βάλοι ἀργυρότοξος Ἀπόλλων σήμερον ἐν μεγάροις, ἢ ὑπὸ μνηστῆρσι δαμείη, ὡς Ὀδυσῆΐ γε τηλοῦ ἀπώλετο νόστιμον ἦμαρ.
With this he left them to come on at their leisure, while he went quickly forward and soon reached the house of his master. When he got there he went in and took his seat among the suitors opposite Eurymakhos, who liked him better than any of the others. The servants brought him a portion of meat, and an upper woman servant set bread before him that he might eat. Presently Odysseus and the swineherd came up to the house and stood by it, amid a sound of music, for Phemios was just beginning to sing to the suitors. Then Odysseus took hold of the swineherd's hand, and said:	ὣς εἰπὼν τοὺς μὲν λίπεν αὐτοῦ ἦκα κιόντας, αὐτὰρ ὁ βῆ, μάλα δʼ ὦκα δόμους ἵκανεν ἄνακτος. αὐτίκα δʼ εἴσω ἴεν, μετὰ δὲ μνηστῆρσι καθῖζεν, ἀντίον Εὐρυμάχου· τὸν γὰρ φιλέεσκε μάλιστα. τῷ πάρα μὲν κρειῶν μοῖραν θέσαν οἳ πονέοντο, σῖτον δʼ αἰδοίη ταμίη παρέθηκε φέρουσα ἔδμεναι. ἀγχίμολον δʼ Ὀδυσεὺς καὶ δῖος ὑφορβὸς στήτην ἐρχομένω, περὶ δέ σφεας ἤλυθʼ ἰωὴ φόρμιγγος γλαφυρῆς· ἀνὰ γάρ σφισι βάλλετʼ ἀείδειν Φήμιος· αὐτὰρ ὁ χειρὸς ἑλὼν προσέειπε συβώτην·
"""Eumaios, this house of Odysseus is a very fine place. No matter how far you go you will find few like it. One building keeps following on after another. The outer court has a wall with battlements all round it; the doors are double folding, and of good workmanship; it would be a hard matter to take it by force of arms. I perceive, too, that there are many people banqueting within it, for there is a smell of roast meat, and I hear a sound of music, which the gods have made to go along with feasting."""	Εὔμαιʼ, ἦ μάλα δὴ τάδε δώματα κάλʼ Ὀδυσῆος, ῥεῖα δʼ ἀρίγνωτʼ ἐστὶ καὶ ἐν πολλοῖσιν ἰδέσθαι. ἐξ ἑτέρων ἕτερʼ ἐστίν, ἐπήσκηται δέ οἱ αὐλὴ τοίχῳ καὶ θριγκοῖσι, θύραι δʼ εὐερκέες εἰσὶ δικλίδες· οὐκ ἄν τίς μιν ἀνὴρ ὑπεροπλίσσαιτο. γιγνώσκω δʼ ὅτι πολλοὶ ἐν αὐτῷ δαῖτα τίθενται ἄνδρες, ἐπεὶ κνίση μὲν ἀνήνοθεν, ἐν δέ τε φόρμιγξ ἠπύει, ἣν ἄρα δαιτὶ θεοὶ ποίησαν ἑταίρην.
"Then Eumaios said, ""You have perceived aright, as indeed you generally do; but let us think what will be our best course. Will you go inside first and join the suitors, leaving me here behind you, or will you wait here and let me go in first? But do not wait long, or some one may you loitering about outside, and throw something at you. Consider this matter I pray you."""	τὸν δʼ ἀπαμειβόμενος προσέφης, Εὔμαιε συβῶτα· ῥεῖʼ ἔγνως, ἐπεὶ οὐδὲ τά τʼ ἄλλα πέρ ἐσσʼ ἀνοήμων. ἀλλʼ ἄγε δὴ φραζώμεθʼ ὅπως ἔσται τάδε ἔργα. ἠὲ σὺ πρῶτος ἔσελθε δόμους εὖ ναιετάοντας, δύσεο δὲ μνηστῆρας, ἐγὼ δʼ ὑπολείψομαι αὐτοῦ· εἰ δʼ ἐθέλεις, ἐπίμεινον, ἐγὼ δʼ εἶμι προπάροιθε· μηδὲ σὺ δηθύνειν, μή τίς σʼ ἔκτοσθε νοήσας ἢ βάλῃ ἢ ἐλάσῃ· τὰ δέ σε φράζεσθαι ἄνωγα.
"And Odysseus answered, ""I understand and heed. Go in first and leave me here where I am. I am quite used to being beaten and having things thrown at me. I have been so much buffeted about in war and by sea that I am case-hardened, and this too may go with the rest. But a man cannot hide away the cravings of a hungry belly; this is an enemy which gives much trouble to all men; it is because of this that ships are fitted out to sail the seas, and to make war upon other people."""	τὸν δʼ ἠμείβετʼ ἔπειτα πολύτλας δῖος Ὀδυσσεύς· γιγνώσκω, φρονέω· τά γε δὴ νοέοντι κελεύεις. ἀλλʼ ἔρχευ προπάροιθεν, ἐγὼ δʼ ὑπολείψομαι αὐτοῦ. οὐ γάρ τι πληγέων ἀδαήμων οὐδὲ βολάων· τολμήεις μοι θυμός, ἐπεὶ κακὰ πολλὰ πέπονθα κύμασι καὶ πολέμῳ· μετὰ καὶ τόδε τοῖσι γενέσθω· γαστέρα δʼ οὔ πως ἔστιν ἀποκρύψαι μεμαυῖαν, οὐλομένην, ἣ πολλὰ κάκʼ ἀνθρώποισι δίδωσι, τῆς ἕνεκεν καὶ νῆες ἐΰζυγοι ὁπλίζονται πόντον ἐπʼ ἀτρύγετον, κακὰ δυσμενέεσσι φέρουσαι.
As they were thus talking, a dog that had been lying asleep raised his head and pricked up his ears. This was Argos, whom Odysseus had bred before setting out for Troy , but he had never had any work out of him. In the old days he used to be taken out by the young men when they went hunting wild goats, or deer, or hares, but now that his master was gone he was lying neglected on the heaps of mule and cow dung that lay in front of the stable doors till the men should come and draw it away to manure the great field; and he was full of fleas. As soon as he saw Odysseus standing there, he dropped his ears and wagged his tail, but he could not get close up to his master. When Odysseus saw the dog on the other side of the yard, dashed a tear from his eyes without Eumaios seeing it, and said:	ὣς οἱ μὲν τοιαῦτα πρὸς ἀλλήλους ἀγόρευον· ἂν δὲ κύων κεφαλήν τε καὶ οὔατα κείμενος ἔσχεν, Ἄργος, Ὀδυσσῆος ταλασίφρονος, ὅν ῥά ποτʼ αὐτὸς θρέψε μέν, οὐδʼ ἀπόνητο, πάρος δʼ εἰς Ἴλιον ἱρὴν ᾤχετο. τὸν δὲ πάροιθεν ἀγίνεσκον νέοι ἄνδρες αἶγας ἐπʼ ἀγροτέρας ἠδὲ πρόκας ἠδὲ λαγωούς· δὴ τότε κεῖτʼ ἀπόθεστος ἀποιχομένοιο ἄνακτος, ἐν πολλῇ κόπρῳ, ἥ οἱ προπάροιθε θυράων ἡμιόνων τε βοῶν τε ἅλις κέχυτʼ, ὄφρʼ ἂν ἄγοιεν δμῶες Ὀδυσσῆος τέμενος μέγα κοπρήσοντες· ἔνθα κύων κεῖτʼ Ἄργος, ἐνίπλειος κυνοραιστέων. δὴ τότε γʼ, ὡς ἐνόησεν Ὀδυσσέα ἐγγὺς ἐόντα, οὐρῇ μέν ῥʼ ὅ γʼ ἔσηνε καὶ οὔατα κάββαλεν ἄμφω, ἆσσον δʼ οὐκέτʼ ἔπειτα δυνήσατο οἷο ἄνακτος ἐλθέμεν· αὐτὰρ ὁ νόσφιν ἰδὼν ἀπομόρξατο δάκρυ, ῥεῖα λαθὼν Εὔμαιον, ἄφαρ δʼ ἐρεείνετο μύθῳ·
"""Eumaios, what a noble hound that is over yonder on the manure heap: his build is splendid; is he as fine a fellow as he looks, or is he only one of those dogs that come begging about a table, and are kept merely for show?"""	Εὔμαιʼ, ἦ μάλα θαῦμα, κύων ὅδε κεῖτʼ ἐνὶ κόπρῳ. καλὸς μὲν δέμας ἐστίν, ἀτὰρ τόδε γʼ οὐ σάφα οἶδα, εἰ δὴ καὶ ταχὺς ἔσκε θέειν ἐπὶ εἴδεϊ τῷδε, ἦ αὔτως οἷοί τε τραπεζῆες κύνες ἀνδρῶν γίγνοντʼ· ἀγλαΐης δʼ ἕνεκεν κομέουσιν ἄνακτες.
"""This hound,"" answered Eumaios, ""belonged to him who has died in a far country. If he were what he was when Odysseus left for Troy , he would soon show you what he could do. There was not a wild beast in the forest that could get away from him when he was once on its tracks. But now he has fallen on evil times, for his master is dead and gone, and the women take no care of him. Servants never do their work when their master's hand is no longer over them, for Zeus takes half the goodness   out of a man when he makes a slave of him."""	τὸν δʼ ἀπαμειβόμενος προσέφης, Εὔμαιε συβῶτα· καὶ λίην ἀνδρός γε κύων ὅδε τῆλε θανόντος. εἰ τοιόσδʼ εἴη ἠμὲν δέμας ἠδὲ καὶ ἔργα, οἷόν μιν Τροίηνδε κιὼν κατέλειπεν Ὀδυσσεύς, αἶψά κε θηήσαιο ἰδὼν ταχυτῆτα καὶ ἀλκήν. οὐ μὲν γάρ τι φύγεσκε βαθείης βένθεσιν ὕλης κνώδαλον, ὅττι δίοιτο· καὶ ἴχνεσι γὰρ περιῄδη· νῦν δʼ ἔχεται κακότητι, ἄναξ δέ οἱ ἄλλοθι πάτρης ὤλετο, τὸν δὲ γυναῖκες ἀκηδέες οὐ κομέουσι. δμῶες δʼ, εὖτʼ ἂν μηκέτʼ ἐπικρατέωσιν ἄνακτες, οὐκέτʼ ἔπειτʼ ἐθέλουσιν ἐναίσιμα ἐργάζεσθαι· ἥμισυ γάρ τʼ ἀρετῆς ἀποαίνυται εὐρύοπα Ζεὺς ἀνέρος, εὖτʼ ἄν μιν κατὰ δούλιον ἦμαρ ἕλῃσιν.
As he spoke he went inside the buildings to the room where the suitors were, but Argos died as soon as he had recognized his master.	ὣς εἰπὼν εἰσῆλθε δόμους εὖ ναιετάοντας, βῆ δʼ ἰθὺς μεγάροιο μετὰ μνηστῆρας ἀγαυούς. Ἄργον δʼ αὖ κατὰ μοῖρʼ ἔλαβεν μέλανος θανάτοιο, αὐτίκʼ ἰδόντʼ Ὀδυσῆα ἐεικοστῷ ἐνιαυτῷ.
Telemakhos saw Eumaios long before any one else did, and beckoned him to come and sit beside him; so he looked about and saw a seat lying near where the carver sat serving out their portions to the suitors; he picked it up, brought it to Telemakhos’ table, and sat down opposite him. Then the servant brought him his portion, and gave him bread from the bread-basket.	τὸν δὲ πολὺ πρῶτος ἴδε Τηλέμαχος θεοειδὴς ἐρχόμενον κατὰ δῶμα συβώτην, ὦκα δʼ ἔπειτα νεῦσʼ ἐπὶ οἷ καλέσας· ὁ δὲ παπτήνας ἕλε δίφρον κείμενον, ἔνθα τε δαιτρὸς ἐφίζεσκε κρέα πολλὰ δαιόμενος μνηστῆρσι δόμον κάτα δαινυμένοισι· τὸν κατέθηκε φέρων πρὸς Τηλεμάχοιο τράπεζαν ἀντίον, ἔνθα δʼ ἄρʼ αὐτὸς ἐφέζετο· τῷ δʼ ἄρα κῆρυξ μοῖραν ἑλὼν ἐτίθει κανέου τʼ ἐκ σῖτον ἀείρας.
"Immediately afterwards Odysseus came inside, looking like a poor miserable old beggar, leaning on his staff and with his clothes all in rags. He sat down upon the threshold of ash-wood just inside the doors leading from the outer to the inner court, and against a bearing-post of cypress-wood which the carpenter had skillfully planed, and had made to join truly with rule and line. Telemakhos took a whole loaf from the bread-basket, with as much meat as he could hold in his two hands, and said to Eumaios, ""Take this to the stranger, and tell him to go the round of the suitors, and beg from them; a beggar must not be shamefaced  ."""	ἀγχίμολον δὲ μετʼ αὐτὸν ἐδύσετο δώματʼ Ὀδυσσεύς, πτωχῷ λευγαλέῳ ἐναλίγκιος ἠδὲ γέροντι, σκηπτόμενος· τὰ δὲ λυγρὰ περὶ χροΐ εἵματα ἕστο. ἷζε δʼ ἐπὶ μελίνου οὐδοῦ ἔντοσθε θυράων, κλινάμενος σταθμῷ κυπαρισσίνῳ, ὅν ποτε τέκτων ξέσσεν ἐπισταμένως καὶ ἐπὶ στάθμην ἴθυνεν. Τηλέμαχος δʼ ἐπὶ οἷ καλέσας προσέειπε συβώτην, ἄρτον τʼ οὖλον ἑλὼν περικαλλέος ἐκ κανέοιο καὶ κρέας, ὥς οἱ χεῖρες ἐχάνδανον ἀμφιβαλόντι· δὸς τῷ ξείνῳ ταῦτα φέρων αὐτόν τε κέλευε αἰτίζειν μάλα πάντας ἐποιχόμενον μνηστῆρας· αἰδὼς δʼ οὐκ ἀγαθὴ κεχρημένῳ ἀνδρὶ παρεῖναι.
"So Eumaios went up to him and said, ""Stranger, Telemakhos sends you this, and says you are to go the round of the suitors begging, for beggars must not be shamefaced  ."""	ὣς φάτο, βῆ δὲ συφορβός, ἐπεὶ τὸν μῦθον ἄκουσεν, ἀγχοῦ δʼ ἱστάμενος ἔπεα πτερόεντʼ ἀγόρευε· Τηλέμαχός τοι, ξεῖνε, διδοῖ τάδε, καί σε κελεύει αἰτίζειν μάλα πάντας ἐποιχόμενον μνηστῆρας· αἰδῶ δʼ οὐκ ἀγαθήν φησʼ ἔμμεναι ἀνδρὶ προΐκτῃ.
"Odysseus answered, ""May lord Zeus grant all happiness   to Telemakhos, and fulfill the desire of his heart."""	τὸν δʼ ἀπαμειβόμενος προσέφη πολύμητις Ὀδυσσεύς· Ζεῦ ἄνα, Τηλέμαχόν μοι ἐν ἀνδράσιν ὄλβιον εἶναι, καί οἱ πάντα γένοιθʼ ὅσσα φρεσὶν ᾗσι μενοινᾷ.
"Then with both hands he took what Telemakhos had sent him, and laid it on the dirty old wallet at his feet. He went on eating it while the bard was singing, and had just finished his dinner as he left off. The suitors applauded the bard, whereon Athena went up to Odysseus and prompted him to beg pieces of bread from each one of the suitors, that he might see what kind of people they were, and tell the good from the bad; but come what might she was not going to save a single one of them. Odysseus, therefore, went on his round, going from left to right, and stretched out his hands to beg as though he were a real beggar. Some of them pitied him, and were curious about him, asking one another who he was and where he came from; whereon the goatherd Melanthios said, ""Suitors of my noble mistress, I can tell you something about him, for I have seen him before. The swineherd brought him here, but I know nothing about the man himself, nor where he comes from."""	ἦ ῥα καὶ ἀμφοτέρῃσιν ἐδέξατο καὶ κατέθηκεν αὖθι ποδῶν προπάροιθεν, ἀεικελίης ἐπὶ πήρης, ἤσθιε δʼ ἧος ἀοιδὸς ἐνὶ μεγάροισιν ἄειδεν· εὖθʼ ὁ δεδειπνήκειν, ὁ δʼ ἐπαύετο θεῖος ἀοιδός. μνηστῆρες δʼ ὁμάδησαν ἀνὰ μέγαρʼ. αὐτὰρ Ἀθήνη, ἄγχι παρισταμένη Λαερτιάδην Ὀδυσῆα ὤτρυνʼ, ὡς ἂν πύρνα κατὰ μνηστῆρας ἀγείροι, γνοίη θʼ οἵ τινές εἰσιν ἐναίσιμοι οἵ τʼ ἀθέμιστοι· ἀλλʼ οὐδʼ ὥς τινʼ ἔμελλʼ ἀπαλεξήσειν κακότητος. βῆ δʼ ἴμεν αἰτήσων ἐνδέξια φῶτα ἕκαστον, πάντοσε χεῖρʼ ὀρέγων, ὡς εἰ πτωχὸς πάλαι εἴη. οἱ δʼ ἐλεαίροντες δίδοσαν, καὶ ἐθάμβεον αὐτόν, ἀλλήλους τʼ εἴροντο τίς εἴη καὶ πόθεν ἔλθοι. τοῖσι δὲ καὶ μετέειπε Μελάνθιος, αἰπόλος αἰγῶν· κέκλυτέ μευ, μνηστῆρες ἀγακλειτῆς βασιλείης, τοῦδε περὶ ξείνου· ἦ γάρ μιν πρόσθεν ὄπωπα. ἦ τοι μέν οἱ δεῦρο συβώτης ἡγεμόνευεν, αὐτὸν δʼ οὐ σάφα οἶδα, πόθεν γένος εὔχεται εἶναι.
"On this Antinoos began to abuse the swineherd. ""You precious idiot,"" he cried, ""what have you brought this man to town for? Have we not tramps and beggars enough already to pester us as we sit at meat? Do you think it a small thing that such people gather here to waste your master's property and must you needs bring this man as well?"""	ὣς ἔφατʼ, Ἀντίνοος δʼ ἔπεσιν νείκεσσε συβώτην· ὦ ἀρίγνωτε συβῶτα, τίη δὲ σὺ τόνδε πόλινδε ἤγαγες; ἦ οὐχ ἅλις ἧμιν ἀλήμονές εἰσι καὶ ἄλλοι, πτωχοὶ ἀνιηροί, δαιτῶν ἀπολυμαντῆρες; ἦ ὄνοσαι ὅτι τοι βίοτον κατέδουσιν ἄνακτος ἐνθάδʼ ἀγειρόμενοι, σὺ δὲ καὶ προτὶ τόνδʼ ἐκάλεσσας;
"And Eumaios answered, ""Antinoos, your birth is good but your words evil. It was no doing of mine that he came here. Who is likely to invite a stranger from a foreign country, unless it be one of those who can do public service as a seer  , a healer of hurts, a carpenter, or a bard who can delight us with his singing. Such men are welcome all the world over, but no one is likely to ask a beggar who will only worry him. You are always harder on Odysseus’ servants than any of the other suitors are, and above all on me, but I do not care so long as Telemakhos and Penelope are alive and here."""	τὸν δʼ ἀπαμειβόμενος προσέφης, Εὔμαιε συβῶτα· Ἀντίνοʼ, οὐ μὲν καλὰ καὶ ἐσθλὸς ἐὼν ἀγορεύεις· τίς γὰρ δὴ ξεῖνον καλεῖ ἄλλοθεν αὐτὸς ἐπελθὼν ἄλλον γʼ, εἰ μὴ τῶν οἳ δημιοεργοὶ ἔασι, μάντιν ἢ ἰητῆρα κακῶν ἢ τέκτονα δούρων, ἢ καὶ θέσπιν ἀοιδόν, ὅ κεν τέρπῃσιν ἀείδων; οὗτοι γὰρ κλητοί γε βροτῶν ἐπʼ ἀπείρονα γαῖαν· πτωχὸν δʼ οὐκ ἄν τις καλέοι τρύξοντα ἓ αὐτόν. ἀλλʼ αἰεὶ χαλεπὸς περὶ πάντων εἶς μνηστήρων δμωσὶν Ὀδυσσῆος, πέρι δʼ αὖτʼ ἐμοί· αὐτὰρ ἐγώ γε οὐκ ἀλέγω, ἧός μοι ἐχέφρων Πηνελόπεια ζώει ἐνὶ μεγάροις καὶ Τηλέμαχος θεοειδής.
"But Telemakhos said, ""Hush, do not answer him; Antinoos has the bitterest tongue of all the suitors, and he makes the others worse."""	τὸν δʼ αὖ Τηλέμαχος πεπνυμένος ἀντίον ηὔδα· σίγα, μή μοι τοῦτον ἀμείβεο πολλὰ ἔπεσσιν· Ἀντίνοος δʼ εἴωθε κακῶς ἐρεθιζέμεν αἰεὶ μύθοισιν χαλεποῖσιν, ἐποτρύνει δὲ καὶ ἄλλους.
"Then turning to Antinoos he said, ""Antinoos, you take as much care of my interests as though I were your son. Why should you want to see this stranger turned out of the house? Heaven forbid; take something and give it him yourself; I do not grudge it; I bid you take it. Never mind my mother, nor any of the other servants in the house; but I know you will not do what I say, for you are more fond of eating things yourself than of giving them to other people."""	ἦ ῥα καὶ Ἀντίνοον ἔπεα πτερόεντα προσηύδα· Ἀντίνοʼ, ἦ μευ καλὰ πατὴρ ὣς κήδεαι υἷος, ὃς τὸν ξεῖνον ἄνωγας ἀπὸ μεγάροιο διέσθαι μύθῳ ἀναγκαίῳ· μὴ τοῦτο θεὸς τελέσειε. δός οἱ ἑλών· οὔ τοι φθονέω· κέλομαι γὰρ ἐγώ γε· μήτʼ οὖν μητέρʼ ἐμὴν ἅζευ τό γε μήτε τινʼ ἄλλον δμώων, οἳ κατὰ δώματʼ Ὀδυσσῆος θείοιο. ἀλλʼ οὔ τοι τοιοῦτον ἐνὶ στήθεσσι νόημα· αὐτὸς γὰρ φαγέμεν πολὺ βούλεαι ἢ δόμεν ἄλλῳ.
"""What do you mean, Telemakhos,"" replied Antinoos, ""by this swaggering talk? If all the suitors were to give him as much as I will, he would not come here again for another three months."""	τὸν δʼ αὖτʼ Ἀντίνοος ἀπαμειβόμενος προσέειπε· Τηλέμαχʼ ὑψαγόρη, μένος ἄσχετε, ποῖον ἔειπες. εἴ οἱ τόσσον ἅπαντες ὀρέξειαν μνηστῆρες, καί κέν μιν τρεῖς μῆνας ἀπόπροθεν οἶκος ἐρύκοι.
As he spoke he drew the stool on which he rested his dainty feet from under the table, and made as though he would throw it at Odysseus, but the other suitors all gave him something, and filled his wallet with bread and meat; he was about, therefore, to go back to the threshold and eat what the suitors had given him, but he first went up to Antinoos and said:	ὣς ἄρʼ ἔφη, καὶ θρῆνυν ἑλὼν ὑπέφηνε τραπέζης κείμενον, ᾧ ῥʼ ἔπεχεν λιπαροὺς πόδας εἰλαπινάζων· οἱ δʼ ἄλλοι πάντες δίδοσαν, πλῆσαν δʼ ἄρα πήρην σίτου καὶ κρειῶν· τάχα δὴ καὶ ἔμελλεν Ὀδυσσεὺς αὖτις ἐπʼ οὐδὸν ἰὼν προικὸς γεύσεσθαι Ἀχαιῶν· στῆ δὲ παρʼ Ἀντίνοον, καί μιν πρὸς μῦθον ἔειπε·
"""Sir, give me something; you are not, surely, the poorest man here; you seem to be a chief, foremost among them all; therefore you should be the better giver, and I will tell far and wide of your bounty. I too was a rich   man once, and had a fine house of my own; in those days I gave to many a tramp such as I now am, no matter who he might be nor what he wanted. I had any number of servants, and all the other things which people have who live well and are accounted wealthy, but it pleased Zeus to take all away from me. He sent me with a band of roving robbers to Egypt ; it was a long voyage and I was undone by it. I stationed my ships in the river Aigyptos, and bade my men stay by them and keep guard over them, while I sent out scouts to reconnoiter from every point of vantage."	δός, φίλος· οὐ μέν μοι δοκέεις ὁ κάκιστος Ἀχαιῶν ἔμμεναι, ἀλλʼ ὤριστος, ἐπεὶ βασιλῆϊ ἔοικας. τῷ σε χρὴ δόμεναι καὶ λώϊον ἠέ περ ἄλλοι σίτου· ἐγὼ δέ κέ σε κλείω κατʼ ἀπείρονα γαῖαν. καὶ γὰρ ἐγώ ποτε οἶκον ἐν ἀνθρώποισιν ἔναιον ὄλβιος ἀφνειὸν καὶ πολλάκι δόσκον ἀλήτῃ, τοίῳ ὁποῖος ἔοι καὶ ὅτευ κεχρημένος ἔλθοι· ἦσαν δὲ δμῶες μάλα μυρίοι ἄλλα τε πολλὰ οἷσίν τʼ εὖ ζώουσι καὶ ἀφνειοὶ καλέονται. ἀλλὰ Ζεὺς ἀλάπαξε Κρονίων—ἤθελε γάρ που— ὅς μʼ ἅμα ληϊστῆρσι πολυπλάγκτοισιν ἀνῆκεν Αἴγυπτόνδʼ ἰέναι, δολιχὴν ὁδόν, ὄφρʼ ἀπολοίμην. στῆσα δʼ ἐν Αἰγύπτῳ ποταμῷ νέας ἀμφιελίσσας. ἔνθʼ ἦ τοι μὲν ἐγὼ κελόμην ἐρίηρας ἑταίρους αὐτοῦ πὰρ νήεσσι μένειν καὶ νῆας ἔρυσθαι, ὀπτῆρας δὲ κατὰ σκοπιὰς ὤτρυνα νέεσθαι.
"""But the men insolently disobeyed   my orders, took to their own devices, and ravaged the land of the Egyptians, killing the men, and taking their wives and children captives. The alarm was soon carried to the city, and when they heard the war-cry, the people came out at daybreak till the plain was filled with soldiers horse and foot, and with the gleam of armor. Then Zeus spread panic among my men, and they would no longer face the enemy, for they found themselves surrounded. The Egyptians killed many of us, and took the rest alive to do forced labor for them; as for myself, they gave me to a friend who met them, to take to Cyprus , Dmetor by name, son of Iasos, who was a great man in Cyprus . Thence I am come hither in a state of great misery."""	οἱ δʼ ὕβρει εἴξαντες, ἐπισπόμενοι μένεϊ σφῷ, αἶψα μάλʼ Αἰγυπτίων ἀνδρῶν περικαλλέας ἀγροὺς πόρθεον, ἐκ δὲ γυναῖκας ἄγον καὶ νήπια τέκνα, αὐτούς τʼ ἔκτεινον· τάχα δʼ ἐς πόλιν ἵκετʼ ἀϋτή. οἱ δὲ βοῆς ἀΐοντες ἅμʼ ἠοῖ φαινομένηφιν ἦλθον· πλῆτο δὲ πᾶν πεδίον πεζῶν τε καὶ ἵππων χαλκοῦ τε στεροπῆς· ἐν δὲ Ζεὺς τερπικέραυνος φύζαν ἐμοῖς ἑτάροισι κακὴν βάλεν, οὐδέ τις ἔτλη στῆναι ἐναντίβιον· περὶ γὰρ κακὰ πάντοθεν ἔστη. ἔνθʼ ἡμέων πολλοὺς μὲν ἀπέκτανον ὀξέϊ χαλκῷ, τοὺς δʼ ἄναγον ζωούς, σφίσιν ἐργάζεσθαι ἀνάγκῃ. αὐτὰρ ἔμʼ ἐς Κύπρον ξείνῳ δόσαν ἀντιάσαντι, Δμήτορι Ἰασίδῃ, ὃς Κύπρου ἶφι ἄνασσεν· ἔνθεν δὴ νῦν δεῦρο τόδʼ ἵκω πήματα πάσχων.
"Then Antinoos said, ""What can have sent such a pestilence to plague us during our dinner? Get out, into the open part of the court, or I will give you Egypt and Cyprus over again for your insolence and importunity; you have begged of all the others, and they have given you lavishly, for they have abundance round them, and it is easy to be free with other people's property when there is plenty of it."""	τὸν δʼ αὖτʼ Ἀντίνοος ἀπαμείβετο φώνησέν τε· τίς δαίμων τόδε πῆμα προσήγαγε, δαιτὸς ἀνίην; στῆθʼ οὕτως ἐς μέσσον, ἐμῆς ἀπάνευθε τραπέζης, μὴ τάχα πικρὴν Αἴγυπτον καὶ Κύπρον ἵκηαι· ὥς τις θαρσαλέος καὶ ἀναιδής ἐσσι προΐκτης. ἑξείης πάντεσσι παρίστασαι· οἱ δὲ διδοῦσι μαψιδίως, ἐπεὶ οὔ τις ἐπίσχεσις οὐδʼ ἐλεητὺς ἀλλοτρίων χαρίσασθαι, ἐπεὶ πάρα πολλὰ ἑκάστῳ.
"On this Odysseus began to move off, and said, ""Your looks, my fine sir, are better than your breeding; if you were in your own house you would not spare a poor man so much as a pinch of salt, for though you are in another man's, and surrounded with abundance, you cannot find it in you to give him even a piece of bread."""	τὸν δʼ ἀναχωρήσας προσέφη πολύμητις Ὀδυσσεύς· ὢ πόποι, οὐκ ἄρα σοί γʼ ἐπὶ εἴδεϊ καὶ φρένες ἦσαν· οὐ σύ γʼ ἂν ἐξ οἴκου σῷ ἐπιστάτῃ οὐδʼ ἅλα δοίης, ὃς νῦν ἀλλοτρίοισι παρήμενος οὔ τί μοι ἔτλης σίτου ἀποπροελὼν δόμεναι· τὰ δὲ πολλὰ πάρεστιν.
"This made Antinoos very angry, and he scowled at him saying, ""You shall pay for this before you get clear of the court."" With these words he threw a footstool at him, and hit him on the right shoulder-blade near the top of his back. Odysseus stood firm as a rock and the blow did not even stagger him, but he shook his head in silence as he brooded on his revenge. Then he went back to the threshold and sat down there, laying his well-filled wallet at his feet."	ὣς ἔφατʼ, Ἀντίνοος δʼ ἐχολώσατο κηρόθι μᾶλλον, καί μιν ὑπόδρα ἰδὼν ἔπεα πτερόεντα προσηύδα· νῦν δή σʼ οὐκέτι καλὰ διὲκ μεγάροιό γʼ ὀΐω ἂψ ἀναχωρήσειν, ὅτε δὴ καὶ ὀνείδεα βάζεις. ὣς ἄρʼ ἔφη, καὶ θρῆνυν ἑλὼν βάλε δεξιὸν ὦμον, πρυμνότατον κατὰ νῶτον· ὁ δʼ ἐστάθη ἠΰτε πέτρη ἔμπεδον, οὐδʼ ἄρα μιν σφῆλεν βέλος Ἀντινόοιο, ἀλλʼ ἀκέων κίνησε κάρη, κακὰ βυσσοδομεύων. ἂψ δʼ ὅ γʼ ἐπʼ οὐδὸν ἰὼν κατʼ ἄρʼ ἕζετο, κὰδ δʼ ἄρα πήρην θῆκεν ἐϋπλείην, μετὰ δὲ μνηστῆρσιν ἔειπε·
"""Listen to me,"" he cried, ""you suitors of Queen Penelope, that I may speak even as I am minded. A man knows neither ache   nor pain   if he gets hit while fighting for his wealth, or for his sheep or his cattle; and even so Antinoos has hit me while in the service of my miserable belly, which is always getting people into trouble. Still, if the poor have gods and avenging deities at all, I pray them that Antinoos may come to a bad end before his marriage."""	κέκλυτέ μευ, μνηστῆρες ἀγακλειτῆς βασιλείης, ὄφρʼ εἴπω τά με θυμὸς ἐνὶ στήθεσσι κελεύει. οὐ μὰν οὔτʼ ἄχος ἐστὶ μετὰ φρεσὶν οὔτε τι πένθος, ὁππότʼ ἀνὴρ περὶ οἷσι μαχειόμενος κτεάτεσσι βλήεται, ἢ περὶ βουσὶν ἢ ἀργεννῇς ὀΐεσσιν· αὐτὰρ ἔμʼ Ἀντίνοος βάλε γαστέρος εἵνεκα λυγρῆς, οὐλομένης, ἣ πολλὰ κάκʼ ἀνθρώποισι δίδωσιν. ἀλλʼ εἴ που πτωχῶν γε θεοὶ καὶ Ἐρινύες εἰσίν, Ἀντίνοον πρὸ γάμοιο τέλος θανάτοιο κιχείη.
"""Sit where you are, and eat your victuals in silence, or be off elsewhere,"" shouted Antinoos. ""If you say more I will have you dragged hand and foot through the courts, and the servants shall flay you alive."""	τὸν δʼ αὖτʼ Ἀντίνοος προσέφη, Εὐπείθεος υἱός· ἔσθιʼ ἕκηλος, ξεῖνε, καθήμενος, ἢ ἄπιθʼ ἄλλῃ, μή σε νέοι διὰ δώματʼ ἐρύσσωσʼ, οἷʼ ἀγορεύεις, ἢ ποδὸς ἢ καὶ χειρός, ἀποδρύψωσι δὲ πάντα.
"The other suitors were much displeased at this, and one of the young men said, ""Antinoos, you did ill in striking that poor wretch of a tramp: it will be worse for you if he should turn out to be some god - and we know the gods go about disguised in all sorts of ways as people from foreign countries, and travel about the world to see who do amiss   and who righteously."""	ὣς ἔφαθʼ, οἱ δʼ ἄρα πάντες ὑπερφιάλως νεμέσησαν· ὧδε δέ τις εἴπεσκε νέων ὑπερηνορεόντων· Ἀντίνοʼ, οὐ μὲν κάλʼ ἔβαλες δύστηνον ἀλήτην, οὐλόμενʼ, εἰ δή πού τις ἐπουράνιος θεός ἐστιν. καί τε θεοὶ ξείνοισιν ἐοικότες ἀλλοδαποῖσι, παντοῖοι τελέθοντες, ἐπιστρωφῶσι πόληας, ἀνθρώπων ὕβριν τε καὶ εὐνομίην ἐφορῶντες.
Thus said the suitors, but Antinoos paid them no heed. Meanwhile Telemakhos was greatly distressed   about the blow that had been given to his father, and though no tear fell from him, he shook his head in silence and brooded on his revenge.	ὣς ἄρʼ ἔφαν μνηστῆρες, ὁ δʼ οὐκ ἐμπάζετο μύθων.

"Now when Penelope heard that the beggar had been struck in the banqueting-room, she said before her maids, ""Would that Apollo would so strike you, Antinoos,"" and her waiting woman Eurynome answered, ""If our prayers were answered not one of the suitors would ever again see the sun rise."" Then Penelope said, ""Nurse, every single one of them is hateful   to me, for they mean nothing but mischief, but I hate Antinoos like the darkness of death itself. A poor unfortunate tramp has come begging about the house for sheer want. Every one else has given him something to put in his wallet, but Antinoos has hit him on the right shoulder-blade with a footstool."""	τοῦ δʼ ὡς οὖν ἤκουσε περίφρων Πηνελόπεια βλημένου ἐν μεγάρῳ, μετʼ ἄρα δμῳῇσιν ἔειπεν· αἴθʼ οὕτως αὐτόν σε βάλοι κλυτότοξος Ἀπόλλων. τὴν δʼ αὖτʼ Εὐρυνόμη ταμίη πρὸς μῦθον ἔειπεν· εἰ γὰρ ἐπʼ ἀρῇσιν τέλος ἡμετέρῃσι γένοιτο· οὐκ ἄν τις τούτων γε ἐΰθρονον Ἠῶ ἵκοιτο. τὴν δʼ αὖτε προσέειπε περίφρων Πηνελόπεια· μαῖʼ, ἐχθροὶ μὲν πάντες, ἐπεὶ κακὰ μηχανόωνται· Ἀντίνοος δὲ μάλιστα μελαίνῃ κηρὶ ἔοικε. ξεῖνός τις δύστηνος ἀλητεύει κατὰ δῶμα ἀνέρας αἰτίζων· ἀχρημοσύνη γὰρ ἀνώγει· ἔνθʼ ἄλλοι μὲν πάντες ἐνέπλησάν τʼ ἔδοσάν τε, οὗτος δὲ θρήνυι πρυμνὸν βάλε δεξιὸν ὦμον.
"Thus did she talk with her maids as she sat in her own room, and in the meantime Odysseus was getting his dinner. Then she called for the swineherd and said, ""Eumaios, go and tell the stranger to come here, I want to see him and ask him some questions. He seems to have traveled much, and he may have seen or heard something of my unhappy husband."""	ἡ μὲν ἄρʼ ὣς ἀγόρευε μετὰ δμῳῇσι γυναιξίν, ἡμένη ἐν θαλάμῳ· ὁ δʼ ἐδείπνεε δῖος Ὀδυσσεύς· ἡ δʼ ἐπὶ οἷ καλέσασα προσηύδα δῖον ὑφορβόν· ἔρχεο, δῖʼ Εὔμαιε, κιὼν τὸν ξεῖνον ἄνωχθι ἐλθέμεν, ὄφρα τί μιν προσπτύξομαι ἠδʼ ἐρέωμαι εἴ που Ὀδυσσῆος ταλασίφρονος ἠὲ πέπυσται ἢ ἴδεν ὀφθαλμοῖσι· πολυπλάγκτῳ γὰρ ἔοικε.
"To this you answered, O swineherd Eumaios, ""If these Achaeans, my lady, would only keep quiet, you would be charmed with the history of his adventures. I had him three days and three nights with me in my hut, which was the first place he reached after running away from his ship, and he has not yet completed the story of his misfortunes. If he had been the most heaven-taught minstrel in the whole world, on whose lips all hearers hang entranced, I could not have been more charmed as I sat in my hut and listened to him. He says there is an old friendship between his house and that of Odysseus, and that he comes from Crete where the descendants of Minos live, after having been driven here and there by every kind of misfortune; he also declares that he has heard of Odysseus as being alive and near at hand among the Thesprotians  , and that he is bringing great wealth home with him."""	τὴν δʼ ἀπαμειβόμενος προσέφης, Εὔμαιε συβῶτα εἰ γάρ τοι, βασίλεια, σιωπήσειαν Ἀχαιοί· οἷʼ ὅ γε μυθεῖται, θέλγοιτό κέ τοι φίλον ἦτορ. τρεῖς γὰρ δή μιν νύκτας ἔχον, τρία δʼ ἤματʼ ἔρυξα ἐν κλισίῃ· πρῶτον γὰρ ἔμʼ ἵκετο νηὸς ἀποδράς· ἀλλʼ οὔ πω κακότητα διήνυσεν ἣν ἀγορεύων. ὡς δʼ ὅτʼ ἀοιδὸν ἀνὴρ ποτιδέρκεται, ὅς τε θεῶν ἒξ ἀείδει δεδαὼς ἔπεʼ ἱμερόεντα βροτοῖσι, τοῦ δʼ ἄμοτον μεμάασιν ἀκουέμεν, ὁππότʼ ἀείδῃ· ὣς ἐμὲ κεῖνος ἔθελγε παρήμενος ἐν μεγάροισι. φησὶ δʼ Ὀδυσσῆος ξεῖνος πατρώϊος εἶναι, Κρήτῃ ναιετάων, ὅθι Μίνωος γένος ἐστίν. ἔνθεν δὴ νῦν δεῦρο τόδʼ ἵκετο πήματα πάσχων, προπροκυλινδόμενος· στεῦται δʼ Ὀδυσῆος ἀκοῦσαι, ἀγχοῦ, Θεσπρωτῶν ἀνδρῶν ἐν πίονι δήμῳ, ζωοῦ· πολλὰ δʼ ἄγει κειμήλια ὅνδε δόμονδε.
"""Call him here, then,"" said Penelope, ""that I too may hear his story. As for the suitors, let them take their pleasure indoors or out as they will, for they have nothing to fret about. Their grain and wine remain unwasted in their houses with none but servants to consume them, while they keep hanging about our house day after day sacrificing our oxen, sheep, and fat goats for their banquets, and never giving so much as a thought to the quantity of wine they drink. No estate can stand such recklessness, for we have now no Odysseus to protect us. If he were to come again, he and his son would soon have their violent revenge  ."""	τὸν δʼ αὖτε προσέειπε περίφρων Πηνελόπεια· ἔρχεο, δεῦρο κάλεσσον, ἵνʼ ἀντίον αὐτὸς ἐνίσπῃ. οὗτοι δʼ ἠὲ θύρῃσι καθήμενοι ἑψιαάσθων. ἢ αὐτοῦ κατὰ δώματʼ, ἐπεί σφισι θυμὸς ἐΰφρων. αὐτῶν μὲν γὰρ κτήματʼ ἀκήρατα κεῖτʼ ἐνὶ οἴκῳ, σῖτος καὶ μέθυ ἡδύ· τὰ μὲν οἰκῆες ἔδουσιν, οἱ δʼ εἰς ἡμέτερον πωλεύμενοι ἤματα πάντα, βοῦς ἱερεύοντες καὶ ὄϊς καὶ πίονας αἶγας, εἰλαπινάζουσιν πίνουσί τε αἴθοπα οἶνον, μαψιδίως· τὰ δὲ πολλὰ κατάνεται. οὐ γὰρ ἔπʼ ἀνήρ, οἷος Ὀδυσσεὺς ἔσκεν, ἀρὴν ἀπὸ οἴκου ἀμῦναι. εἰ δʼ Ὀδυσεὺς ἔλθοι καὶ ἵκοιτʼ ἐς πατρίδα γαῖαν, αἶψά κε σὺν ᾧ παιδὶ βίας ἀποτίσεται ἀνδρῶν.
"As she spoke Telemakhos sneezed so loudly that the whole house resounded with it. Penelope laughed when she heard this, and said to Eumaios, ""Go and call the stranger; did you not hear how my son sneezed just as I was speaking? This can only mean that all the suitors are going to be killed, and that not one of them shall escape. Furthermore I say, and lay my saying to your heart: if I am satisfied that the stranger is speaking the truth I shall give him a shirt and cloak of good wear."""	ὣς φάτο, Τηλέμαχος δὲ μέγʼ ἔπταρεν, ἀμφὶ δὲ δῶμα σμερδαλέον κονάβησε· γέλασσε δὲ Πηνελόπεια, αἶψα δʼ ἄρʼ Εὔμαιον ἔπεα πτερόεντα προσηύδα· ἔρχεό μοι, τὸν ξεῖνον ἐναντίον ὧδε κάλεσσον. οὐχ ὁράᾳς ὅ μοι υἱὸς ἐπέπταρε πᾶσιν ἔπεσσι; τῷ κε καὶ οὐκ ἀτελὴς θάνατος μνηστῆρσι γένοιτο πᾶσι μάλʼ, οὐδέ κέ τις θάνατον καὶ κῆρας ἀλύξει. ἄλλο δέ τοι ἐρέω, σὺ δʼ ἐνὶ φρεσὶ βάλλεο σῇσιν· αἴ κʼ αὐτὸν γνώω νημερτέα πάντʼ ἐνέποντα, ἕσσω μιν χλαῖνάν τε χιτῶνά τε, εἵματα καλά.
"When Eumaios heard this he went straight to Odysseus and said, ""Father stranger, my mistress Penelope, mother of Telemakhos, has sent for you; she is in great grief, but she wishes to hear anything you can tell her about her husband, and if she is satisfied that you are speaking the truth, she will give you a shirt and cloak, which are the very things that you are most in want of. As for bread, you can get enough of that to fill your belly, by begging about the , and letting those give that will."""	ὣς φάτο, βῆ δὲ συφορβός, ἐπεὶ τὸν μῦθον ἄκουσεν· ἀγχοῦ δʼ ἱστάμενος ἔπεα πτερόεντα προσηύδα· ξεῖνε πάτερ, καλέει σε περίφρων Πηνελόπεια, μήτηρ Τηλεμάχοιο· μεταλλῆσαί τί ἑ θυμὸς ἀμφὶ πόσει κέλεται, καὶ κήδεά περ πεπαθυίῃ. εἰ δέ κέ σε γνώῃ νημερτέα πάντʼ ἐνέποντα, ἕσσει σε χλαῖνάν τε χιτῶνά τε, τῶν σὺ μάλιστα χρηΐζεις· σῖτον δὲ καὶ αἰτίζων κατὰ δῆμον γαστέρα βοσκήσεις· δώσει δέ τοι ὅς κʼ ἐθέλῃσι.
"""I will tell Penelope,"" answered Odysseus, ""nothing but what is strictly true. I know all about her husband, and have been partner with him in affliction, but I am afraid of passing through this crowd of cruel suitors, for their overweening pride   and violent insolence   reach heaven. Just now, moreover, as I was going about the house without doing any harm, a man gave me a blow that hurt me very much, but neither Telemakhos nor any one else defended me. Tell Penelope, therefore, to be patient and wait till sundown. Let her give me a seat close up to the fire, for my clothes are worn very thin - you know they are, for you have seen them ever since I first asked you to help me - she can then ask me about the return of her husband."""	τὸν δʼ αὖτε προσέειπε πολύτλας δῖος Ὀδυσσεύς· Εὔμαιʼ, αἶψά κʼ ἐγὼ νημερτέα πάντʼ ἐνέποιμι κούρῃ Ἰκαρίοιο, περίφρονι Πηνελοπείῃ· οἶδα γὰρ εὖ περὶ κείνου, ὁμὴν δʼ ἀνεδέγμεθʼ ὀϊζύν. ἀλλὰ μνηστήρων χαλεπῶν ὑποδείδιʼ ὅμιλον, τῶν ὕβρις τε βίη τε σιδήρεον οὐρανὸν ἵκει. καὶ γὰρ νῦν, ὅτε μʼ οὗτος ἀνὴρ κατὰ δῶμα κιόντα οὔ τι κακὸν ῥέξαντα βαλὼν ὀδύνῃσιν ἔδωκεν, οὔτε τι Τηλέμαχος τό γʼ ἐπήρκεσεν οὔτε τις ἄλλος. τῷ νῦν Πηνελόπειαν ἐνὶ μεγάροισιν ἄνωχθι μεῖναι, ἐπειγομένην περ, ἐς ἠέλιον καταδύντα· καὶ τότε μʼ εἰρέσθω πόσιος πέρι νόστιμον ἦμαρ, ἀσσοτέρω καθίσασα παραὶ πυρί· εἵματα γάρ τοι λύγρʼ ἔχω· οἶσθα καὶ αὐτός, ἐπεί σε πρῶθʼ ἱκέτευσα.
"The swineherd went back when he heard this, and Penelope said as she saw him cross the threshold, ""Why do you not bring him here, Eumaios? Is he afraid that some one will ill-treat him, or is he shy of coming inside the house at all? Beggars should not be shamefaced."""	ὣς φάτο, βῆ δὲ συφορβός, ἐπεὶ τὸν μῦθον ἄκουσε. τὸν δʼ ὑπὲρ οὐδοῦ βάντα προσηύδα Πηνελόπεια· οὐ σύ γʼ ἄγεις, Εὔμαιε· τί τοῦτʼ ἐνόησεν ἀλήτης; ἦ τινά που δείσας ἐξαίσιον ἦε καὶ ἄλλως αἰδεῖται κατὰ δῶμα; κακὸς δʼ αἰδοῖος ἀλήτης.
"To this you answered, O swineherd Eumaios, ""The stranger is quite reasonable. He is avoiding the outrageous   suitors, and is only doing what any one else would do. He asks you to wait till sundown, and it will be much better, my lady, that you should have him all to yourself, when you can hear him and talk to him as you will."""	τὴν δʼ ἀπαμειβόμενος προσέφης, Εὔμαιε συβῶτα· μυθεῖται κατὰ μοῖραν, ἅ πέρ κʼ οἴοιτο καὶ ἄλλος, ὕβριν ἀλυσκάζων ἀνδρῶν ὑπερηνορεόντων. ἀλλά σε μεῖναι ἄνωγεν ἐς ἠέλιον καταδύντα. καὶ δὲ σοὶ ὧδʼ αὐτῇ πολὺ κάλλιον, ὦ βασίλεια, οἴην πρὸς ξεῖνον φάσθαι ἔπος ἠδʼ ἐπακοῦσαι.
"""The man is no fool,"" answered Penelope, ""it would very likely be as he says, for there are no such abominable people in the whole world as these men are."""	τὸν δʼ αὖτε προσέειπε περίφρων Πηνελόπεια· οὐκ ἄφρων ὁ ξεῖνος· ὀΐεται, ὥς περ ἂν εἴη· οὐ γάρ πού τινες ὧδε καταθνητῶν ἀνθρώπων ἀνέρες ὑβρίζοντες ἀτάσθαλα μηχανόωνται.
"When she had done speaking Eumaios went back to the suitors, for he had explained everything. Then he went up to Telemakhos and said in his ear so that none could overhear him, ""My dear sir, I will now go back to the pigs, to see after your property and my own business. You will look to what is going on here, but above all be careful to keep out of danger, for there are many who bear you ill will. May Zeus bring them to a bad end before they do us a mischief."""	ἡ μὲν ἄρʼ ὣς ἀγόρευεν, ὁ δʼ ᾤχετο δῖος ὑφορβὸς μνηστήρων ἐς ὅμιλον, ἐπεὶ διεπέφραδε πάντα. αἶψα δὲ Τηλέμαχον ἔπεα πτερόεντα προσηύδα, ἄγχι σχὼν κεφαλήν, ἵνα μὴ πευθοίαθʼ οἱ ἄλλοι· ὦ φίλʼ, ἐγὼ μὲν ἄπειμι, σύας καὶ κεῖνα φυλάξων, σὸν καὶ ἐμὸν βίοτον· σοὶ δʼ ἐνθάδε πάντα μελόντων. αὐτὸν μέν σε πρῶτα σάω, καὶ φράζεο θυμῷ μή τι πάθῃς· πολλοὶ δὲ κακὰ φρονέουσιν Ἀχαιῶν, τοὺς Ζεὺς ἐξολέσειε πρὶν ἡμῖν πῆμα γενέσθαι.
"""Very well,"" replied Telemakhos, ""go home when you have had your dinner, and in the morning come here with the victims we are to sacrifice for the day. Leave the rest to heaven and me."""	τὸν δʼ αὖ Τηλέμαχος πεπνυμένος ἀντίον ηὔδα· ἔσσεται οὕτως, ἄττα· σὺ δʼ ἔρχεο δειελιήσας· ἠῶθεν δʼ ἰέναι καὶ ἄγειν ἱερήϊα καλά· αὐτὰρ ἐμοὶ τάδε πάντα καὶ ἀθανάτοισι μελήσει.
On this Eumaios took his seat again, and when he had finished his dinner he left the courts and the room with the men at table, and went back to his pigs. As for the suitors, they presently began to amuse themselves with singing and dancing, for it was now getting on towards evening.	ὣς φάθʼ, ὁ δʼ αὖτις ἄρʼ ἕζετʼ ἐϋξέστου ἐπὶ δίφρου, πλησάμενος δʼ ἄρα θυμὸν ἐδητύος ἠδὲ ποτῆτος βῆ ῥʼ ἴμεναι μεθʼ ὕας, λίπε δʼ ἕρκεά τε μέγαρόν τε, πλεῖον δαιτυμόνων· οἱ δʼ ὀρχηστυῖ καὶ ἀοιδῇ
Now there came a certain common tramp who used to go begging all over the city of Ithaca , and was notorious as an incorrigible glutton and drunkard. This man had no strength   nor stay in him, but he was a great hulking fellow to look at; his real name, the one his mother gave him, was Arnaios, but the young men of the place called him Iros, because he used to run errands for any one who would send him. As soon as he came he began to insult Odysseus, and to try and drive him out of his own house.	ἦλθε δʼ ἐπὶ πτωχὸς πανδήμιος, ὃς κατὰ ἄστυ πτωχεύεσκʼ Ἰθάκης, μετὰ δʼ ἔπρεπε γαστέρι μάργῃ ἀζηχὲς φαγέμεν καὶ πιέμεν· οὐδέ οἱ ἦν ἲς οὐδὲ βίη, εἶδος δὲ μάλα μέγας ἦν ὁράασθαι.

"""Be off, old man,"" he cried, ""from the doorway, or you shall be dragged out neck and heels. Do you not see that they are all giving me the wink, and wanting me to turn you out by force, only I do not like to do so? Get up then, and go of yourself, or we shall come to blows."""	εἶκε, γέρον, προθύρου, μὴ δὴ τάχα καὶ ποδὸς ἕλκῃ. οὐκ ἀΐεις ὅτι δή μοι ἐπιλλίζουσιν ἅπαντες, ἑλκέμεναι δὲ κέλονται; ἐγὼ δʼ αἰσχύνομαι ἔμπης. ἀλλʼ ἄνα, μὴ τάχα νῶϊν ἔρις καὶ χερσὶ γένηται.
"Odysseus frowned on him and said, ""My friend, I do you no manner of harm; people give you a great deal, but I am not jealous. There is room enough in this doorway for the pair of us, and you need not grudge me things that are not yours to give. You seem to be just such another tramp as myself, but perhaps the gods will give us better luck   by and by. Do not, however, talk too much about fighting or you will incense me, and old though I am, I shall cover your mouth and chest with blood. I shall have more peace tomorrow if I do, for you will not come to the house of Odysseus any more."""	τὸν δʼ ἄρʼ ὑπόδρα ἰδὼν προσέφη πολύμητις Ὀδυσσεύς· δαιμόνιʼ, οὔτε τί σε ῥέζω κακὸν οὔτʼ ἀγορεύω, οὔτε τινὰ φθονέω δόμεναι καὶ πόλλʼ ἀνελόντα. οὐδὸς δʼ ἀμφοτέρους ὅδε χείσεται, οὐδέ τί σε χρὴ ἀλλοτρίων φθονέειν· δοκέεις δέ μοι εἶναι ἀλήτης ὥς περ ἐγών, ὄλβον δὲ θεοὶ μέλλουσιν ὀπάζειν. χερσὶ δὲ μή τι λίην προκαλίζεο, μή με χολώσῃς, μή σε γέρων περ ἐὼν στῆθος καὶ χείλεα φύρσω αἵματος· ἡσυχίη δʼ ἂν ἐμοὶ καὶ μᾶλλον ἔτʼ εἴη αὔριον· οὐ μὲν γάρ τί σʼ ὑποστρέψεσθαι ὀΐω δεύτερον ἐς μέγαρον Λαερτιάδεω Ὀδυσῆος.
"Iros was very angry and answered, ""You filthy glutton, you run on trippingly like an old fish-fag. I have a good mind to lay both hands about you, and knock your teeth out of your head like so many boar's tusks. Get ready, therefore, and let these people here stand by and look on. You will never be able to fight one who is so much younger than yourself."""	τὸν δὲ χολωσάμενος προσεφώνεεν Ἶρος ἀλήτης· ὢ πόποι, ὡς ὁ μολοβρὸς ἐπιτροχάδην ἀγορεύει, γρηῒ καμινοῖ ἶσος· ὃν ἂν κακὰ μητισαίμην κόπτων ἀμφοτέρῃσι, χαμαὶ δέ κε πάντας ὀδόντας γναθμῶν ἐξελάσαιμι συὸς ὣς ληϊβοτείρης. ζῶσαι νῦν, ἵνα πάντες ἐπιγνώωσι καὶ οἵδε μαρναμένους· πῶς δʼ ἂν σὺ νεωτέρῳ ἀνδρὶ μάχοιο;
"Thus roundly did they rate one another on the smooth pavement in front of the doorway, and when Antinoos saw what was going on he laughed heartily and said to the others, ""This is the finest sport that you ever saw; heaven never yet sent anything like it into this house. The stranger and Iros have quarreled and are going to fight, let us set them on to do so at once."""	ὣς οἱ μὲν προπάροιθε θυράων ὑψηλάων οὐδοῦ ἔπι ξεστοῦ πανθυμαδὸν ὀκριόωντο. τοῖϊν δὲ ξυνέηχʼ ἱερὸν μένος Ἀντινόοιο, ἡδὺ δʼ ἄρʼ ἐκγελάσας μετεφώνει μνηστήρεσσιν· ὦ φίλοι, οὐ μέν πώ τι πάρος τοιοῦτον ἐτύχθη, οἵην τερπωλὴν θεὸς ἤγαγεν ἐς τόδε δῶμα. ὁ ξεῖνός τε καὶ Ἶρος ἐρίζετον ἀλλήλοιϊν χερσὶ μαχέσσασθαι· ἀλλὰ ξυνελάσσομεν ὦκα.
"The suitors all came up laughing, and gathered round the two ragged tramps. ""Listen to me,"" said Antinoos, ""there are some goats’ paunches down at the fire, which we have filled with blood and fat, and set aside for supper; he who is victorious and proves himself to be the better man shall have his pick of the lot; he shall be free of our table and we will not allow any other beggar about the house at all."""	ὣς ἔφαθʼ, οἱ δʼ ἄρα πάντες ἀνήϊξαν γελόωντες, ἀμφὶ δʼ ἄρα πτωχοὺς κακοείμονας ἠγερέθοντο. τοῖσιν δʼ Ἀντίνοος μετέφη, Εὐπείθεος υἱός· κέκλυτέ μευ, μνηστῆρες ἀγήνορες, ὄφρα τι εἴπω. γαστέρες αἵδʼ αἰγῶν κέατʼ ἐν πυρί, τὰς ἐπὶ δόρπῳ κατθέμεθα κνίσης τε καὶ αἵματος ἐμπλήσαντες· ὁππότερος δέ κε νικήσῃ κρείσσων τε γένηται, τάων ἥν κʼ ἐθέλῃσιν ἀναστὰς αὐτὸς ἑλέσθω· αἰεὶ αὖθʼ ἡμῖν μεταδαίσεται, οὐδέ τινʼ ἄλλον πτωχὸν ἔσω μίσγεσθαι ἐάσομεν αἰτήσοντα.
"The others all agreed, but Odysseus, to throw them off the scent, said, ""Sirs, an old man like myself, worn out with suffering, cannot hold his own against a young one; but my irrepressible belly urges me on, though I know it can only end in my getting a drubbing. You must swear, however that none of you will give me a foul blow to favor Iros and secure him the victory."""	ὣς ἔφατʼ Ἀντίνοος, τοῖσιν δʼ ἐπιήνδανε μῦθος. τοῖς δὲ δολοφρονέων μετέφη πολύμητις Ὀδυσσεύς· ὦ φίλοι, οὔ πως ἔστι νεωτέρῳ ἀνδρὶ μάχεσθαι ἄνδρα γέροντα, δύῃ ἀρημένον· ἀλλά με γαστὴρ ὀτρύνει κακοεργός, ἵνα πληγῇσι δαμείω. ἀλλʼ ἄγε νῦν μοι πάντες ὀμόσσατε καρτερὸν ὅρκον, μή τις ἐπʼ Ἴρῳ ἦρα φέρων ἐμὲ χειρὶ βαρείῃ πλήξῃ ἀτασθάλλων, τούτῳ δέ με ἶφι δαμάσσῃ.
"They swore as he told them, and when they had completed their oath Telemakhos put in a word and said, ""Stranger, if you have a mind to settle with this fellow, you need not be afraid of any one here. Whoever strikes you will have to fight more than one. I am host, and the other chiefs, Antinoos and Eurymakhos, both of them men of understanding, are of the same mind as I am."""	ὣς ἔφαθʼ, οἱ δʼ ἄρα πάντες ἀπώμνυον ὡς ἐκέλευεν. αὐτὰρ ἐπεί ῥʼ ὄμοσάν τε τελεύτησάν τε τὸν ὅρκον, τοῖς δʼ αὖτις μετέειφʼ ἱερὴ ἲς Τηλεμάχοιο· ξεῖνʼ, εἴ σʼ ὀτρύνει κραδίη καὶ θυμὸς ἀγήνωρ τοῦτον ἀλέξασθαι, τῶν δʼ ἄλλων μή τινʼ Ἀχαιῶν δείδιθʼ, ἐπεὶ πλεόνεσσι μαχήσεται ὅς κέ σε θείνῃ· ξεινοδόκος μὲν ἐγών, ἐπὶ δʼ αἰνεῖτον βασιλῆες, Ἀντίνοός τε καὶ Εὐρύμαχος, πεπνυμένω ἄμφω.
"Every one assented, and Odysseus girded his old rags about his loins, thus baring his stalwart thighs, his broad chest and shoulders, and his mighty arms; but Athena came up to him and made his limbs even stronger still. The suitors were beyond measure astonished, and one would turn towards his neighbor saying, ""The stranger has brought such a thigh out of his old rags that there will soon be nothing left of Iros."""	ὣς ἔφαθʼ, οἱ δʼ ἄρα πάντες ἐπῄνεον· αὐτὰρ Ὀδυσσεὺς ζώσατο μὲν ῥάκεσιν περὶ μήδεα, φαῖνε δὲ μηροὺς καλούς τε μεγάλους τε, φάνεν δέ οἱ εὐρέες ὦμοι στήθεά τε στιβαροί τε βραχίονες· αὐτὰρ Ἀθήνη ἄγχι παρισταμένη μέλεʼ ἤλδανε ποιμένι λαῶν. μνηστῆρες δʼ ἄρα πάντες ὑπερφιάλως ἀγάσαντο· ὧδε δέ τις εἴπεσκεν ἰδὼν ἐς πλησίον ἄλλον· ἦ τάχα Ἶρος Ἄϊρος ἐπίσπαστον κακὸν ἕξει, οἵην ἐκ ῥακέων ὁ γέρων ἐπιγουνίδα φαίνει.
"Iros began to be very uneasy as he heard them, but the servants girded him by force, and brought him into the open part of the court in such a fright that his limbs were all of a tremble. Antinoos scolded him and said, ""You swaggering bully, you ought never to have been born at all if you are afraid of such an old broken-down creature as this tramp is. I say, therefore - and it shall surely be - if he beats you and proves himself the better man, I shall pack you off on board ship to the mainland and send you to king Echetos, who kills every one that comes near him. He will cut off your nose and ears, and draw out your entrails for the dogs to eat."""	ὣς ἄρʼ ἔφαν, Ἴρῳ δὲ κακῶς ὠρίνετο θυμός. ἀλλὰ καὶ ὣς δρηστῆρες ἄγον ζώσαντες ἀνάγκῃ δειδιότα· σάρκες δὲ περιτρομέοντο μέλεσσιν. Ἀντίνοος δʼ ἐνένιπεν ἔπος τʼ ἔφατʼ ἔκ τʼ ὀνόμαζεν· νῦν μὲν μήτʼ εἴης, βουγάϊε, μήτε γένοιο, εἰ δὴ τοῦτόν γε τρομέεις καὶ δείδιας αἰνῶς, ἄνδρα γέροντα, δύῃ ἀρημένον, ἥ μιν ἱκάνει. ἀλλʼ ἔκ τοι ἐρέω, τὸ δὲ καὶ τετελεσμένον ἔσται· αἴ κέν σʼ οὗτος νικήσῃ κρείσσων τε γένηται, πέμψω σʼ ἤπειρόνδε, βαλὼν ἐν νηὶ μελαίνῃ, εἰς Ἔχετον βασιλῆα, βροτῶν δηλήμονα πάντων, ὅς κʼ ἀπὸ ῥῖνα τάμῃσι καὶ οὔατα νηλέϊ χαλκῷ, μήδεά τʼ ἐξερύσας δώῃ κυσὶν ὠμὰ δάσασθαι.
"This frightened Iros still more, but they brought him into the middle of the court, and the two men raised their hands to fight. Then Odysseus considered whether he should let drive so hard at Iros as to make his leave him there and then as he fell, or whether he should give him a lighter blow that should only knock him down; in the end he deemed it best to give the lighter blow for fear the Achaeans should begin to suspect who he was. Then they began to fight, and Iros hit Odysseus on the right shoulder; but Odysseus gave Iros a blow on the neck under the ear that broke in the bones of his skull, and the blood came gushing out of his mouth; he fell groaning in the dust, gnashing his teeth and kicking on the ground, but the suitors threw up their hands and nearly died of laughter, as Odysseus caught hold of him by the foot and dragged him into the outer court as far as the gate-house. There he propped him up against the wall and put his staff in his hands. ""Sit here,"" said he, ""and keep the dogs and pigs off; you are a pitiful creature, and if you try to make yourself king of the beggars any more you shall fare still worse."""	ὣς φάτο, τῷ δʼ ἔτι μᾶλλον ὑπὸ τρόμος ἔλλαβε γυῖα. ἐς μέσσον δʼ ἄναγον· τὼ δʼ ἄμφω χεῖρας ἀνέσχον. δὴ τότε μερμήριξε πολύτλας δῖος Ὀδυσσεὺς ἢ ἐλάσειʼ ὥς μιν ψυχὴ λίποι αὖθι πεσόντα, ἦέ μιν ἦκʼ ἐλάσειε τανύσσειέν τʼ ἐπὶ γαίῃ. ὧδε δέ οἱ φρονέοντι δοάσσατο κέρδιον εἶναι, ἦκʼ ἐλάσαι, ἵνα μή μιν ἐπιφρασσαίατʼ Ἀχαιοί. δὴ τότʼ ἀνασχομένω ὁ μὲν ἤλασε δεξιὸν ὦμον Ἶρος, ὁ δʼ αὐχένʼ ἔλασσεν ὑπʼ οὔατος, ὀστέα δʼ εἴσω ἔθλασεν· αὐτίκα δʼ ἦλθε κατὰ στόμα φοίνιον αἷμα, κὰδ δʼ ἔπεσʼ ἐν κονίῃσι μακών, σὺν δʼ ἤλασʼ ὀδόντας λακτίζων ποσὶ γαῖαν· ἀτὰρ μνηστῆρες ἀγαυοὶ χεῖρας ἀνασχόμενοι γέλῳ ἔκθανον. αὐτὰρ Ὀδυσσεὺς ἕλκε διὲκ προθύροιο λαβὼν ποδός, ὄφρʼ ἵκετʼ αὐλήν, αἰθούσης τε θύρας· καί μιν ποτὶ ἑρκίον αὐλῆς εἷσεν ἀνακλίνας· σκῆπτρον δέ οἱ ἔμβαλε χειρί, καί μιν φωνήσας ἔπεα πτερόεντα προσηύδα· ἐνταυθοῖ νῦν ἧσο σύας τε κύνας τʼ ἀπερύκων, μηδὲ σύ γε ξείνων καὶ πτωχῶν κοίρανος εἶναι λυγρὸς ἐών, μή πού τι κακὸν καὶ μεῖζον ἐπαύρῃ.
"Then he threw his dirty old wallet, all tattered and torn, over his shoulder with the cord by which it hung, and went back to sit down upon the threshold; but the suitors went within the cloisters, laughing and saluting him, ""May Zeus, and all the other gods,"" said they, ‘grant you whatever you want for having put an end to the importunity of this insatiable tramp. We will take him over to the mainland presently, to king Echetos, who kills every one that comes near him."""	ἦ ῥα καὶ ἀμφʼ ὤμοισιν ἀεικέα βάλλετο πήρην, πυκνὰ ῥωγαλέην· ἐν δὲ στρόφος ἦεν ἀορτήρ. ἂψ δʼ ὅ γʼ ἐπʼ οὐδὸν ἰὼν κατʼ ἄρʼ ἕζετο· τοὶ δʼ ἴσαν εἴσω ἡδὺ γελώοντες καὶ δεικανόωντʼ ἐπέεσσι· Ζεύς τοι δοίη, ξεῖνε, καὶ ἀθάνατοι θεοὶ ἄλλοι, ὅττι μάλιστʼ ἐθέλεις καί τοι φίλον ἔπλετο θυμῷ, ὃς τοῦτον τὸν ἄναλτον ἀλητεύειν ἀπέπαυσας ἐν δήμῳ· τάχα γάρ μιν ἀνάξομεν ἤπειρόνδε εἰς Ἔχετον βασιλῆα, βροτῶν δηλήμονα πάντων.
"Odysseus hailed this as of good omen, and Antinoos set a great goat's paunch before him filled with blood and fat. Amphinomos took two loaves out of the bread-basket and brought them to him, pledging him as he did so in a golden goblet of wine. ""Good luck to you,"" he said, ""father stranger, you are very badly off at present, but I hope you will have better times   by and by."""	ὣς ἄρʼ ἔφαν, χαῖρεν δὲ κλεηδόνι δῖος Ὀδυσσεύς. Ἀντίνοος δʼ ἄρα οἱ μεγάλην παρὰ γαστέρα θῆκεν, ἐμπλείην κνίσης τε καὶ αἵματος· Ἀμφίνομος δὲ ἄρτους ἐκ κανέοιο δύω παρέθηκεν ἀείρας καὶ δέπαϊ χρυσέῳ δειδίσκετο, φώνησέν τε· χαῖρε, πάτερ ὦ ξεῖνε, γένοιτό τοι ἔς περ ὀπίσσω ὄλβος· ἀτὰρ μὲν νῦν γε κακοῖς ἔχεαι πολέεσσι.
"To this Odysseus answered, ""Amphinomos, you seem to be a man of good understanding, as indeed you may well be, seeing whose son you are. I have heard your father well spoken of  ; he is Nisus of Dulichium, a man both brave and wealthy. They tell me you are his son, and you appear to be a considerable person; listen, therefore, and take heed to what I am saying. Man is the vainest of all creatures that have their being upon earth. As long as the gods grant him and his knees are steady, he thinks that he shall come to no harm hereafter, and even when the blessed gods bring sorrow upon him, he bears it as he needs must, and makes the best of it; for the father of gods and men gives men their daily minds   day by day. I know all about it, for I was a rich   man once, and did much wrong in the stubbornness   of my pride, and in the confidence that my father and my brothers would support me; therefore let a man be pious in all things always, and take the good that the gods may see fit to send him without vainglory. Consider the infamy of what these suitors are doing; see how they are wasting the estate, and doing dishonor to the wife, of one who is certain to return some day, and that, too, not long hence. Nay, he will be here soon; may a send you home quietly first that you may not meet with him in the day of his coming, for once he is here the suitors and he will not part bloodlessly."""	τὸν δʼ ἀπαμειβόμενος προσέφη πολύμητις Ὀδυσσεύς· Ἀμφίνομʼ, ἦ μάλα μοι δοκέεις πεπνυμένος εἶναι· τοίου γὰρ καὶ πατρός, ἐπεὶ κλέος ἐσθλὸν ἄκουον, Νῖσον Δουλιχιῆα ἐΰν τʼ ἔμεν ἀφνειόν τε· τοῦ σʼ ἔκ φασι γενέσθαι, ἐπητῇ δʼ ἀνδρὶ ἔοικας. τοὔνεκά τοι ἐρέω, σὺ δὲ σύνθεο καί μευ ἄκουσον· οὐδὲν ἀκιδνότερον γαῖα τρέφει ἀνθρώποιο, πάντων ὅσσα τε γαῖαν ἔπι πνείει τε καὶ ἕρπει. οὐ μὲν γάρ ποτέ φησι κακὸν πείσεσθαι ὀπίσσω, ὄφρʼ ἀρετὴν παρέχωσι θεοὶ καὶ γούνατʼ ὀρώρῃ· ἀλλʼ ὅτε δὴ καὶ λυγρὰ θεοὶ μάκαρες τελέσωσι, καὶ τὰ φέρει ἀεκαζόμενος τετληότι θυμῷ· τοῖος γὰρ νόος ἐστὶν ἐπιχθονίων ἀνθρώπων οἷον ἐπʼ ἦμαρ ἄγησι πατὴρ ἀνδρῶν τε θεῶν τε. καὶ γὰρ ἐγώ ποτʼ ἔμελλον ἐν ἀνδράσιν ὄλβιος εἶναι, πολλὰ δʼ ἀτάσθαλʼ ἔρεξα βίῃ καὶ κάρτεϊ εἴκων, πατρί τʼ ἐμῷ πίσυνος καὶ ἐμοῖσι κασιγνήτοισι. τῷ μή τίς ποτε πάμπαν ἀνὴρ ἀθεμίστιος εἴη, ἀλλʼ ὅ γε σιγῇ δῶρα θεῶν ἔχοι, ὅττι διδοῖεν. οἷʼ ὁρόω μνηστῆρας ἀτάσθαλα μηχανόωντας, κτήματα κείροντας καὶ ἀτιμάζοντας ἄκοιτιν ἀνδρός, ὃν οὐκέτι φημὶ φίλων καὶ πατρίδος αἴης δηρὸν ἀπέσσεσθαι· μάλα δὲ σχεδόν. ἀλλά σε δαίμων οἴκαδʼ ὑπεξαγάγοι, μηδʼ ἀντιάσειας ἐκείνῳ, ὁππότε νοστήσειε φίλην ἐς πατρίδα γαῖαν· οὐ γὰρ ἀναιμωτί γε διακρινέεσθαι ὀΐω μνηστῆρας καὶ κεῖνον, ἐπεί κε μέλαθρον ὑπέλθῃ.
With these words he made a drink-offering, and when he had drunk he put the gold cup again into the hands of Amphinomos, who walked away serious and bowing his head, for he foreboded evil. But even so he did not escape destruction, for Athena had doomed him fall by the hand of Telemakhos. So he took his seat again at the place from which he had come.	ὣς φάτο, καὶ σπείσας ἔπιεν μελιηδέα οἶνον, ἂψ δʼ ἐν χερσὶν ἔθηκε δέπας κοσμήτορι λαῶν. αὐτὰρ ὁ βῆ διὰ δῶμα φίλον τετιημένος ἦτορ, νευστάζων κεφαλῇ· δὴ γὰρ κακὸν ὄσσετο θυμός. ἀλλʼ οὐδʼ ὣς φύγε κῆρα· πέδησε δὲ καὶ τὸν Ἀθήνη Τηλεμάχου ὑπὸ χερσὶ καὶ ἔγχεϊ ἶφι δαμῆναι. ἂψ δʼ αὖτις κατʼ ἄρʼ ἕζετʼ ἐπὶ θρόνου ἔνθεν ἀνέστη.
"Then Athena put it into the mind of Penelope to show herself to the suitors, that she might make them still more enamored of her, and win still further honor from her son and husband. So she feigned a mocking laugh and said, ""Eurynome, I have changed my and have a fancy to show myself to the suitors although I detest them. I should like also to give my son a hint that he had better not have anything more to do with them. They speak fairly enough but they mean mischief."""	τῇ δʼ ἄρʼ ἐπὶ φρεσὶ θῆκε θεὰ γλαυκῶπις Ἀθήνη, κούρῃ Ἰκαρίοιο, περίφρονι Πηνελοπείῃ, μνηστήρεσσι φανῆναι, ὅπως πετάσειε μάλιστα θυμὸν μνηστήρων ἰδὲ τιμήεσσα γένοιτο μᾶλλον πρὸς πόσιός τε καὶ υἱέος ἢ πάρος ἦεν. ἀχρεῖον δʼ ἐγέλασσεν ἔπος τʼ ἔφατʼ ἔκ τʼ ὀνόμαζεν· Εὐρυνόμη, θυμός μοι ἐέλδεται, οὔ τι πάρος γε, μνηστήρεσσι φανῆναι, ἀπεχθομένοισί περ ἔμπης· παιδὶ δέ κεν εἴποιμι ἔπος, τό κε κέρδιον εἴη, μὴ πάντα μνηστῆρσιν ὑπερφιάλοισιν ὁμιλεῖν, οἵ τʼ εὖ μὲν βάζουσι, κακῶς δʼ ὄπιθεν φρονέουσι.
"""My dear child,"" answered Eurynome, ""all that you have said is true, go and tell your son about it, but first wash yourself and anoint your face. Do not go about with your cheeks all covered with tears; it is not right that you should grieve so incessantly; for Telemakhos, whom you always prayed that you might live to see with a beard, is already grown up."""	τὴν δʼ αὖτʼ Εὐρυνόμη ταμίη πρὸς μῦθον ἔειπεν· ναὶ δὴ ταῦτά γε πάντα, τέκος, κατὰ μοῖραν ἔειπες. ἀλλʼ ἴθι καὶ σῷ παιδὶ ἔπος φάο μηδʼ ἐπίκευθε, χρῶτʼ ἀπονιψαμένη καὶ ἐπιχρίσασα παρειάς· μηδʼ οὕτω δακρύοισι πεφυρμένη ἀμφὶ πρόσωπα ἔρχευ, ἐπεὶ κάκιον πενθήμεναι ἄκριτον αἰεί. ἤδη μὲν γάρ τοι παῖς τηλίκος, ὃν σὺ μάλιστα ἠρῶ ἀθανάτοισι γενειήσαντα ἰδέσθαι.
"""I know, Eurynome,"" replied Penelope, ""that you mean well, but do not try and persuade me to wash and to anoint myself, for heaven robbed me of all my beauty on the day my husband sailed; nevertheless, tell Autonoe and Hippodameia that I want them. They must be with me when I am in the room; I am not going among the men alone; it would not be proper for me to do so."""	τὴν δʼ αὖτε προσέειπε περίφρων Πηνελόπεια· Εὐρυνόμη, μὴ ταῦτα παραύδα, κηδομένη περ, χρῶτʼ ἀπονίπτεσθαι καὶ ἐπιχρίεσθαι ἀλοιφῇ· ἀγλαΐην γὰρ ἐμοί γε θεοί, τοὶ Ὄλυμπον ἔχουσιν, ὤλεσαν, ἐξ οὗ κεῖνος ἔβη κοίλῃς ἐνὶ νηυσίν. ἀλλά μοι Αὐτονόην τε καὶ Ἱπποδάμειαν ἄνωχθι ἐλθέμεν, ὄφρα κέ μοι παρστήετον ἐν μεγάροισιν· οἴη δʼ οὐκ εἴσειμι μετʼ ἀνέρας· αἰδέομαι γάρ.
On this the old woman went out of the room to bid the maids go to their mistress. In the meantime Athena bethought her of another matter, and sent Penelope off into a sweet slumber; so she lay down on her couch and her limbs became heavy with sleep. Then the goddess shed grace and beauty over her that all the Achaeans might admire her. She washed her face with the ambrosial loveliness that Aphrodite wears when she goes dancing   with the Graces; she made her taller and of a more commanding figure, while as for her complexion it was whiter than sawn ivory. When Athena had done all this she went away, whereon the maids came in from the women's room and woke Penelope with the sound of their talking.	ὣς ἄρʼ ἔφη, γρηῢς δὲ διὲκ μεγάροιο βεβήκει ἀγγελέουσα γυναιξὶ καὶ ὀτρυνέουσα νέεσθαι. ἔνθʼ αὖτʼ ἄλλʼ ἐνόησε θεὰ γλαυκῶπις Ἀθήνη· κούρῃ Ἰκαρίοιο κατὰ γλυκὺν ὕπνον ἔχευεν, εὗδε δʼ ἀνακλινθεῖσα, λύθεν δέ οἱ ἅψεα πάντα αὐτοῦ ἐνὶ κλιντῆρι· τέως δʼ ἄρα δῖα θεάων ἄμβροτα δῶρα δίδου, ἵνα μιν θησαίατʼ Ἀχαιοί. κάλλεϊ μέν οἱ πρῶτα προσώπατα καλὰ κάθηρεν ἀμβροσίῳ, οἵῳ περ ἐϋστέφανος Κυθέρεια χρίεται, εὖτʼ ἂν ἴῃ Χαρίτων χορὸν ἱμερόεντα· καί μιν μακροτέρην καὶ πάσσονα θῆκεν ἰδέσθαι, λευκοτέρην δʼ ἄρα μιν θῆκε πριστοῦ ἐλέφαντος. ἡ μὲν ἄρʼ ὣς ἔρξασʼ ἀπεβήσετο δῖα θεάων, ἦλθον δʼ ἀμφίπολοι λευκώλενοι ἐκ μεγάροιο φθόγγῳ ἐπερχόμεναι· τὴν δὲ γλυκὺς ὕπνος ἀνῆκε,
"""What an exquisitely delicious sleep I have been having,"" said she, as she passed her hands over her face, ""in spite of all my misery. I wish Artemis would let me die so sweetly now at this very moment, that I might no longer waste in despair for the loss of my dear husband, who possessed every kind of good quality   and was the most distinguished man among the Achaeans."""	καί ῥʼ ἀπομόρξατο χερσὶ παρειὰς φώνησέν τε· ἦ με μάλʼ αἰνοπαθῆ μαλακὸν περὶ κῶμʼ ἐκάλυψεν. αἴθε μοι ὣς μαλακὸν θάνατον πόροι Ἄρτεμις ἁγνὴ αὐτίκα νῦν, ἵνα μηκέτʼ ὀδυρομένη κατὰ θυμὸν αἰῶνα φθινύθω, πόσιος ποθέουσα φίλοιο παντοίην ἀρετήν, ἐπεὶ ἔξοχος ἦεν Ἀχαιῶν.
With these words she came down from her upper room, not alone but attended by two of her maidens, and when she reached the suitors she stood by one of the bearing-posts supporting the roof of the room, holding a veil before her face, and with a staid maid servant on either side of her. As they beheld her the suitors were so overpowered and became so desperately enamored of her, that each one prayed he might win her for his own bed fellow.	ὣς φαμένη κατέβαινʼ ὑπερώϊα σιγαλόεντα, οὐκ οἴη· ἅμα τῇ γε καὶ ἀμφίπολοι δύʼ ἕποντο. ἡ δʼ ὅτε δὴ μνηστῆρας ἀφίκετο δῖα γυναικῶν, στῆ ῥα παρὰ σταθμὸν τέγεος πύκα ποιητοῖο, ἄντα παρειάων σχομένη λιπαρὰ κρήδεμνα· ἀμφίπολος δʼ ἄρα οἱ κεδνὴ ἑκάτερθε παρέστη. τῶν δʼ αὐτοῦ λύτο γούνατʼ, ἔρῳ δʼ ἄρα θυμὸν ἔθελχθεν, πάντες δʼ ἠρήσαντο παραὶ λεχέεσσι κλιθῆναι.
"""Telemakhos,"" said she, addressing her son, ""I fear you are no longer so discreet and well conducted as you used to be. When you were younger you had a subtler thoughtfulness  ; now, however, that you are grown up, though a stranger to look at you would take you for the son of a well-to-do   father as far as size and good looks go, your conduct is by no means what it should be. What is all this disturbance that has been going on, and how came you to allow a stranger to be so disgracefully ill-treated? What would have happened if he had suffered serious injury while a suppliant in our house? Surely this would have been very discreditable to you."""	ἡ δʼ αὖ Τηλέμαχον προσεφώνεεν, ὃν φίλον υἱόν· Τηλέμαχʼ, οὐκέτι τοι φρένες ἔμπεδοι οὐδὲ νόημα· παῖς ἔτʼ ἐὼν καὶ μᾶλλον ἐνὶ φρεσὶ κέρδεʼ ἐνώμας· νῦν δʼ, ὅτε δὴ μέγας ἐσσὶ καὶ ἥβης μέτρον ἱκάνεις, καί κέν τις φαίη γόνον ἔμμεναι ὀλβίου ἀνδρός, ἐς μέγεθος καὶ κάλλος ὁρώμενος, ἀλλότριος φώς, οὐκέτι τοι φρένες εἰσὶν ἐναίσιμοι οὐδὲ νόημα. οἷον δὴ τόδε ἔργον ἐνὶ μεγάροισιν ἐτύχθη, ὃς τὸν ξεῖνον ἔασας ἀεικισθήμεναι οὕτως. πῶς νῦν, εἴ τι ξεῖνος ἐν ἡμετέροισι δόμοισιν ἥμενος ὧδε πάθοι ῥυστακτύος ἐξ ἀλεγεινῆς; σοί κʼ αἶσχος λώβη τε μετʼ ἀνθρώποισι πέλοιτο.
"""I am not surprised, my dear mother, at your displeasure,"" replied Telemakhos, ""I understand all about it and know when things are not as they should be, which I could not do when I was younger; I cannot, however, behave with perfect propriety at all times. First one and then another of these wicked people here keeps driving me out of my mind, and I have no one to stand by me. After all, however, this fight between Iros and the stranger did not turn out as the suitors meant it to do, for the stranger got the best of it. I wish Father Zeus, Athena, and Apollo would break the neck of every one of these wooers of yours, some inside the house and some out; and I wish they might all be as limp as Iros is over yonder in the gate of the outer court. See how he nods his head like a drunken man; he has had such a thrashing that he cannot stand on his feet nor get back to his home  , wherever that may be, for has no strength left in him."""	τὴν δʼ αὖ Τηλέμαχος πεπνυμένος ἀντίον ηὔδα· μῆτερ ἐμή, τὸ μὲν οὔ σε νεμεσσῶμαι κεχολῶσθαι· αὐτὰρ ἐγὼ θυμῷ νοέω καὶ οἶδα ἕκαστα, ἐσθλά τε καὶ τὰ χέρεια· πάρος δʼ ἔτι νήπιος ἦα. ἀλλά τοι οὐ δύναμαι πεπνυμένα πάντα νοῆσαι· ἐκ γάρ με πλήσσουσι παρήμενοι ἄλλοθεν ἄλλος οἵδε κακὰ φρονέοντες, ἐμοὶ δʼ οὐκ εἰσὶν ἀρωγοί. οὐ μέν τοι ξείνου γε καὶ Ἴρου μῶλος ἐτύχθη μνηστήρων ἰότητι, βίῃ δʼ ὅ γε φέρτερος ἦεν. αἲ γάρ, Ζεῦ τε πάτερ καὶ Ἀθηναίη καὶ Ἄπολλον, οὕτω νῦν μνηστῆρες ἐν ἡμετέροισι δόμοισι νεύοιεν κεφαλὰς δεδμημένοι, οἱ μὲν ἐν αὐλῇ, οἱ δʼ ἔντοσθε δόμοιο, λελῦτο δὲ γυῖα ἑκάστου, ὡς νῦν Ἶρος κεῖνος ἐπʼ αὐλείῃσι θύρῃσιν ἧσται νευστάζων κεφαλῇ, μεθύοντι ἐοικώς, οὐδʼ ὀρθὸς στῆναι δύναται ποσὶν οὐδὲ νέεσθαι οἴκαδʼ, ὅπη οἱ νόστος, ἐπεὶ φίλα γυῖα λέλυνται.
"Thus did they converse. Eurymakhos then came up and said, ""Queen Penelope, daughter of Ikarios, if all the Achaeans in Iasian Argos could see you at this moment, you would have still more suitors in your house by tomorrow morning, for you are the most admirable woman in the whole world both as regards personal beauty and strength of understanding."""	ὣς οἱ μὲν τοιαῦτα πρὸς ἀλλήλους ἀγόρευον· Εὐρύμαχος δʼ ἐπέεσσι προσηύδα Πηνελόπειαν· κούρη Ἰκαρίοιο, περίφρον Πηνελόπεια, εἰ πάντες σε ἴδοιεν ἀνʼ Ἴασον Ἄργος Ἀχαιοί, πλέονές κε μνηστῆρες ἐν ὑμετέροισι δόμοισιν ἠῶθεν δαινύατʼ, ἐπεὶ περίεσσι γυναικῶν εἶδός τε μέγεθός τε ἰδὲ φρένας ἔνδον ἐΐσας.
"To this Penelope replied, ""Eurymakhos, heaven robbed me of all my beauty   whether of face or figure when the Argives set sail for Troy and my dear husband with them. If he were to return and look after my affairs, I should both be more respected   and show a better presence to the world. As it is, I am oppressed with care, and with the afflictions which a has seen fit to heap upon me. My husband foresaw it all, and when he was leaving home he took my right wrist in his hand - ‘Wife, ‘he said, ‘we shall not all of us come safe home from Troy , for the Trojans fight well both with bow and spear. They are excellent also at fighting from chariots, and nothing decides   the issue of a fight sooner than this. I know not, therefore, whether heaven will send me back to you, or whether I may not fall over there at Troy . In the meantime do you look after things here. Take care of my father and mother as at present, and even more so during my absence, but when you see our son growing a beard, then marry whom you will, and leave this your present home. This is what he said and now it is all coming true. A night will come when I shall have to yield myself to a marriage which I detest, for Zeus has taken from me all hope of happiness  . This further grief  , moreover, cuts me to the very heart. You suitors are not wooing me after the custom   of my country. When men are courting a woman who they think will be a good wife to them and who is of noble birth, and when they are each trying to win her for himself, they usually bring oxen and sheep to feast the friends of the lady, and they make her magnificent presents, instead of eating up other people's property without paying for it."""	τὸν δʼ ἠμείβετʼ ἔπειτα περίφρων Πηνελόπεια· Εὐρύμαχʼ, ἦ τοι ἐμὴν ἀρετὴν εἶδός τε δέμας τε ὤλεσαν ἀθάνατοι, ὅτε Ἴλιον εἰσανέβαινον Ἀργεῖοι, μετὰ τοῖσι δʼ ἐμὸς πόσις ᾖεν Ὀδυσσεύς. εἰ κεῖνός γʼ ἐλθὼν τὸν ἐμὸν βίον ἀμφιπολεύοι, μεῖζόν κε κλέος εἴη ἐμὸν καὶ κάλλιον οὕτως. νῦν δʼ ἄχομαι· τόσα γάρ μοι ἐπέσσευεν κακὰ δαίμων. ἦ μὲν δὴ ὅτε τʼ ᾖε λιπὼν κάτα πατρίδα γαῖαν, δεξιτερὴν ἐπὶ καρπῷ ἑλὼν ἐμὲ χεῖρα προσηύδα· ὦ γύναι, οὐ γὰρ ὀΐω ἐϋκνήμιδας Ἀχαιοὺς ἐκ Τροίης εὖ πάντας ἀπήμονας ἀπονέεσθαι· καὶ γὰρ Τρῶάς φασι μαχητὰς ἔμμεναι ἄνδρας, ἠμὲν ἀκοντιστὰς ἠδὲ ῥυτῆρας ὀϊστῶν ἵππων τʼ ὠκυπόδων ἐπιβήτορας, οἵ κε τάχιστα ἔκριναν μέγα νεῖκος ὁμοιΐου πολέμοιο. τῷ οὐκ οἶδʼ ἤ κέν μʼ ἀνέσει θεός, ἦ κεν ἁλώω αὐτοῦ ἐνὶ Τροίῃ· σοὶ δʼ ἐνθάδε πάντα μελόντων. μεμνῆσθαι πατρὸς καὶ μητέρος ἐν μεγάροισιν ὡς νῦν, ἢ ἔτι μᾶλλον ἐμεῦ ἀπονόσφιν ἐόντος· αὐτὰρ ἐπὴν δὴ παῖδα γενειήσαντα ἴδηαι, γήμασθʼ ᾧ κʼ ἐθέλῃσθα, τεὸν κατὰ δῶμα λιποῦσα. κεῖνος τὼς ἀγόρευε· τὰ δὴ νῦν πάντα τελεῖται. νὺξ δʼ ἔσται ὅτε δὴ στυγερὸς γάμος ἀντιβολήσει οὐλομένης ἐμέθεν, τῆς τε Ζεὺς ὄλβον ἀπηύρα. ἀλλὰ τόδʼ αἰνὸν ἄχος κραδίην καὶ θυμὸν ἱκάνει· μνηστήρων οὐχ ἥδε δίκη τὸ πάροιθε τέτυκτο· οἵ τʼ ἀγαθήν τε γυναῖκα καὶ ἀφνειοῖο θύγατρα μνηστεύειν ἐθέλωσι καὶ ἀλλήλοις ἐρίσωσιν, αὐτοὶ τοί γʼ ἀπάγουσι βόας καὶ ἴφια μῆλα, κούρης δαῖτα φίλοισι, καὶ ἀγλαὰ δῶρα διδοῦσιν· ἀλλʼ οὐκ ἀλλότριον βίοτον νήποινον ἔδουσιν.
This was what she said, and Odysseus was glad when he heard her trying to get presents out of the suitors, and flattering them with fair words which he knew she did not mean in her .	ὣς φάτο, γήθησεν δὲ πολύτλας δῖος Ὀδυσσεύς, οὕνεκα τῶν μὲν δῶρα παρέλκετο, θέλγε δὲ θυμὸν μειλιχίοις ἐπέεσσι, νόος δέ οἱ ἄλλα μενοίνα.
"Then Antinoos said, ""Queen Penelope, daughter of Ikarios, take as many presents as you please from any one who will give them to you; it is not well to refuse a present; but we will not go about our business nor stir from where we are, till you have married the best man among us whoever he may be."""	τὴν δʼ αὖτʼ Ἀντίνοος προσέφη, Εὐπείθεος υἱός, κούρη Ἰκαρίοιο, περίφρον Πηνελόπεια, δῶρα μὲν ὅς κʼ ἐθέλῃσιν Ἀχαιῶν ἐνθάδʼ ἐνεῖκαι, δέξασθʼ. οὐ γὰρ καλὸν ἀνήνασθαι δόσιν ἐστίν· ἡμεῖς δʼ οὔτʼ ἐπὶ ἔργα πάρος γʼ ἴμεν οὔτε πῃ ἄλλῃ, πρίν γέ σε τῷ γήμασθαι Ἀχαιῶν ὅς τις ἄριστος.
The others applauded what Antinoos had said, and each one sent his servant to bring his present. Antinoos’ man returned with a large and lovely dress most exquisitely embroidered. It had twelve beautifully made brooch pins of pure gold with which to fasten it. Eurymakhos immediately brought her a magnificent chain of gold and amber beads that gleamed like sunlight. Eurydamas’ two men returned with some earrings fashioned into three brilliant pendants which glistened most beautifully  ; while king Peisandros son of Polyktor gave her a necklace of the rarest workmanship, and every one else brought her a beautiful present of some kind.	ὣς ἔφατʼ Ἀντίνοος, τοῖσιν δʼ ἐπιήνδανε μῦθος· δῶρα δʼ ἄρʼ οἰσέμεναι πρόεσαν κήρυκα ἕκαστος.

Then the queen went back to her room upstairs, and her maids brought the presents after her. Meanwhile the suitors took to singing and dancing, and stayed till evening came. They danced and sang till it grew dark; they then brought in three braziers to give light, and piled them up with chopped firewood very and dry, and they lit torches from them, which the maids held up turn and turn about. Then Odysseus said:	ἡ μὲν ἔπειτʼ ἀνέβαινʼ ὑπερώϊα δῖα γυναικῶν, τῇ δʼ ἄρʼ ἅμʼ ἀμφίπολοι ἔφερον περικαλλέα δῶρα οἱ δʼ εἰς ὀρχηστύν τε καὶ ἱμερόεσσαν ἀοιδὴν τρεψάμενοι τέρποντο, μένον δʼ ἐπὶ ἕσπερον ἐλθεῖν. τοῖσι δὲ τερπομένοισι μέλας ἐπὶ ἕσπερος ἦλθεν. αὐτίκα λαμπτῆρας τρεῖς ἵστασαν ἐν μεγάροισιν, ὄφρα φαείνοιεν· περὶ δὲ ξύλα κάγκανα θῆκαν, αὖα πάλαι, περίκηλα, νέον κεκεασμένα χαλκῷ, καὶ δαΐδας μετέμισγον· ἀμοιβηδὶς δʼ ἀνέφαινον δμῳαὶ Ὀδυσσῆος ταλασίφρονος. αὐτὰρ ὁ τῇσιν αὐτὸς διογενῆς μετέφη πολύμητις Ὀδυσσεύς·
"""Maids, servants of Odysseus who has so long been absent, go to the queen inside the house; sit with her and amuse her, or spin, and pick wool. I will hold the light for all these people. They may stay till morning, but shall not beat me, for I can stand a great deal."""	δμῳαὶ Ὀδυσσῆος, δὴν οἰχομένοιο ἄνακτος, ἔρχεσθε πρὸς δώμαθʼ, ἵνʼ αἰδοίη βασίλεια· τῇ δὲ παρʼ ἠλάκατα στροφαλίζετε, τέρπετε δʼ αὐτὴν ἥμεναι ἐν μεγάρῳ, ἢ εἴρια πείκετε χερσίν· αὐτὰρ ἐγὼ τούτοισι φάος πάντεσσι παρέξω. ἤν περ γάρ κʼ ἐθέλωσιν ἐΰθρονον Ἠῶ μίμνειν, οὔ τί με νικήσουσι· πολυτλήμων δὲ μάλʼ εἰμί.
The maids looked at one another and laughed, while pretty Melantho began to gibe at him contemptuously. She was daughter to Dolios, but had been brought up by Penelope, who used to give her toys to play with, and looked after her when she was a child; but in spite of all this she showed no consideration for the sorrows   of her mistress, and used to misconduct herself with Eurymakhos, with whom she was in love.	ὣς ἔφαθʼ, αἱ δʼ ἐγέλασσαν, ἐς ἀλλήλας δὲ ἴδοντο. τὸν δʼ αἰσχρῶς ἐνένιπε Μελανθὼ καλλιπάρῃος, τὴν Δολίος μὲν ἔτικτε, κόμισσε δὲ Πηνελόπεια, παῖδα δὲ ὣς ἀτίταλλε, δίδου δʼ ἄρʼ ἀθύρματα θυμῷ· ἀλλʼ οὐδʼ ὣς ἔχε πένθος ἐνὶ φρεσὶ Πηνελοπείης, ἀλλʼ ἥ γʼ Εὐρυμάχῳ μισγέσκετο καὶ φιλέεσκεν. ἥ ῥʼ Ὀδυσῆʼ ἐνένιπεν ὀνειδείοις ἐπέεσσιν·
"""Poor wretch,"" said she, ""are you gone clean out of your mind? Go and sleep in some smithy, or place of public gossips, instead of chattering here. Are you not ashamed of opening your mouth before your betters - so many of them too? Has the wine been getting into your head, or do you always babble in this way? You seem to have lost your wits because you beat the tramp Iros; take care that a better man than he does not come and cudgel you about the head till he pack you bleeding out of the house."""	ξεῖνε τάλαν, σύ γέ τις φρένας ἐκπεπαταγμένος ἐσσί, οὐδʼ ἐθέλεις εὕδειν χαλκήϊον ἐς δόμον ἐλθών, ἠέ που ἐς λέσχην, ἀλλʼ ἐνθάδε πόλλʼ ἀγορεύεις, θαρσαλέως πολλοῖσι μετʼ ἀνδράσιν, οὐδέ τι θυμῷ ταρβεῖς· ἦ ῥά σε οἶνος ἔχει φρένας, ἤ νύ τοι αἰεὶ τοιοῦτος νόος ἐστίν· ὃ καὶ μεταμώνια βάζεις. ἦ ἀλύεις, ὅτι Ἶρον ἐνίκησας τὸν ἀλήτην; μή τίς τοι τάχα Ἴρου ἀμείνων ἄλλος ἀναστῇ, ὅς τίς σʼ ἀμφὶ κάρη κεκοπὼς χερσὶ στιβαρῇσι δώματος ἐκπέμψῃσι, φορύξας αἵματι πολλῷ.
"""Vixen,"" replied Odysseus, scowling at her, ""I will go and tell Telemakhos what you have been saying, and he will have you torn limb from limb."""	τὴν δʼ ἄρʼ ὑπόδρα ἰδὼν προσέφη πολύμητις Ὀδυσσεύς· ἦ τάχα Τηλεμάχῳ ἐρέω, κύον, οἷʼ ἀγορεύεις, κεῖσʼ ἐλθών, ἵνα σʼ αὖθι διὰ μελεϊστὶ τάμῃσιν.
With these words he scared the women, and they went off into the body of the house. They trembled all aver, for they thought he would do what he said was true  . But Odysseus took his stand near the burning braziers, holding up torches and looking at the people - brooding the while on things that should surely come to pass.	ὣς εἰπὼν ἐπέεσσι διεπτοίησε γυναῖκας. βὰν δʼ ἴμεναι διὰ δῶμα, λύθεν δʼ ὑπὸ γυῖα ἑκάστης ταρβοσύνῃ· φὰν γάρ μιν ἀληθέα μυθήσασθαι. αὐτὰρ ὁ πὰρ λαμπτῆρσι φαείνων αἰθομένοισιν ἑστήκειν ἐς πάντας ὁρώμενος· ἄλλα δέ οἱ κῆρ ὥρμαινε φρεσὶν ᾗσιν, ἅ ῥʼ οὐκ ἀτέλεστα γένοντο.
"But Athena would not let the suitors for one moment cease their insolence, for she wanted Odysseus to become even more bitter against them in his grief  ; she therefore set Eurymakhos son of Polybos on to gibe at him, which made the others laugh. ""Listen to me,"" said he, ""you suitors of Queen Penelope, that I may speak even as I am minded. It is not for nothing that this man has come to the house of Odysseus; I believe the light has not been coming from the torches, but from his own head - for his hair is all gone, every bit of it."""	μνηστῆρας δʼ οὐ πάμπαν ἀγήνορας εἴα Ἀθήνη λώβης ἴσχεσθαι θυμαλγέος, ὄφρʼ ἔτι μᾶλλον δύη ἄχος κραδίην Λαερτιάδεω Ὀδυσῆος. τοῖσιν δʼ Εὐρύμαχος, Πολύβου πάϊς, ἦρχʼ ἀγορεύειν, κερτομέων Ὀδυσῆα· γέλω δʼ ἑτάροισιν ἔτευχε. κέκλυτέ μευ, μνηστῆρες ἀγακλειτῆς βασιλείης, ὄφρʼ εἴπω τά με θυμὸς ἐνὶ στήθεσσι κελεύει. οὐκ ἀθεεὶ ὅδʼ ἀνὴρ Ὀδυσήϊον ἐς δόμον ἵκει· ἔμπης μοι δοκέει δαίδων σέλας ἔμμεναι αὐτοῦ κὰκ κεφαλῆς, ἐπεὶ οὔ οἱ ἔνι τρίχες οὐδʼ ἠβαιαί.
"Then turning to Odysseus he said, ""Stranger, will you work as a servant, if I send you to the outer limits of the field and see that you are well paid? Can you build a stone fence, or plant trees? I will have you fed all the year round, and will find you in shoes and clothing. Will you go, then? Not you; for you have got into bad ways, and do not want to work; you had rather fill your belly by going round the begging."""	ἦ ῥʼ, ἅμα τε προσέειπεν Ὀδυσσῆα πτολίπορθον· ξεῖνʼ, ἦ ἄρ κʼ ἐθέλοις θητευέμεν, εἴ σʼ ἀνελοίμην, ἀγροῦ ἐπʼ ἐσχατιῆς—μισθὸς δέ τοι ἄρκιος ἔσται— αἱμασιάς τε λέγων καὶ δένδρεα μακρὰ φυτεύων; ἔνθα κʼ ἐγὼ σῖτον μὲν ἐπηετανὸν παρέχοιμι, εἵματα δʼ ἀμφιέσαιμι ποσίν θʼ ὑποδήματα δοίην. ἀλλʼ ἐπεὶ οὖν δὴ ἔργα κάκʼ ἔμμαθες, οὐκ ἐθελήσεις ἔργον ἐποίχεσθαι, ἀλλὰ πτώσσειν κατὰ δῆμον βούλεαι, ὄφρʼ ἄν ἔχῃς βόσκειν σὴν γαστέρʼ ἄναλτον. τὸν δʼ ἀπαμειβόμενος προσέφη πολύμητις Ὀδυσσεύς·
"""Eurymakhos,"" answered Odysseus, ""if you and I were to work one against the other in early summer   when the days are at their longest - give me a good scythe, and take another yourself, and let us see which will fast the longer or mow the stronger, from dawn till dark when the mowing grass is about. Or if you will plough against me, let us each take a yoke of tawny oxen, well-mated and of great strength and endurance: turn me into a four acre field, and see whether you or I can drive the straighter furrow. If, again, war were to break out this day, give me a shield, a couple of spears and a helmet fitting well upon my temples - you would find me foremost in the fray, and would cease your gibes about my belly. You are insolent and your is cruel, and you think yourself a great man because you live in a little world, and that a bad one. If Odysseus comes to his own again, the doors of his house are wide, but you will find them narrow when you try to flee through them."""

"Eurymakhos was furious at all this. He scowled at him and cried, ""You wretch, I will soon pay you out for daring to say such things to me, and in public too. Has the wine been getting into your head or do you always babble in this way? You seem to have lost your wits because you beat the tramp Iros. With this he caught hold of a footstool, but Odysseus sought protection at the knees of Amphinomos of Dulichium, for he was afraid. The stool hit the cupbearer on his right hand and knocked him down: the man fell with a cry flat on his back, and his wine-jug fell ringing to the ground. The suitors in the covered room were now in an uproar, and one would turn towards his neighbor, saying, ""I wish the stranger had gone somewhere else, bad luck to hide, for all the trouble he gives us. We cannot permit such disturbance about a beggar; if such ill counsels are to prevail we shall have no more pleasure at our banquet."""	ὣς ἔφατʼ, Εὐρύμαχος δʼ ἐχολώσατο κηρόθι μᾶλλον, καί μιν ὑπόδρα ἰδὼν ἔπεα πτερόεντα προσηύδα· ἆ δείλʼ, ἦ τάχα τοι τελέω κακόν, οἷʼ ἀγορεύεις θαρσαλέως πολλοῖσι μετʼ ἀνδράσιν, οὐδέ τι θυμῷ ταρβεῖς· ἦ ῥά σε οἶνος ἔχει φρένας, ἤ νύ τοι αἰεὶ τοιοῦτος νόος ἐστίν· ὃ καὶ μεταμώνια βάζεις. ἦ ἀλύεις, ὅτι Ἶρον ἐνίκησας τὸν ἀλήτην; ὣς ἄρα φωνήσας σφέλας ἔλλαβεν· αὐτὰρ Ὀδυσσεὺς Ἀμφινόμου πρὸς γοῦνα καθέζετο Δουλιχιῆος, Εὐρύμαχον δείσας· ὁ δʼ ἄρʼ οἰνοχόον βάλε χεῖρα δεξιτερήν· πρόχοος δὲ χαμαὶ βόμβησε πεσοῦσα, αὐτὰρ ὅ γʼ οἰμώξας πέσεν ὕπτιος ἐν κονίῃσι. μνηστῆρες δʼ ὁμάδησαν ἀνὰ μέγαρα σκιόεντα, ὧδε δέ τις εἴπεσκεν ἰδὼν ἐς πλησίον ἄλλον· αἴθʼ ὤφελλʼ ὁ ξεῖνος ἀλώμενος ἄλλοθʼ ὀλέσθαι πρὶν ἐλθεῖν· τῷ οὔ τι τόσον κέλαδον μετέθηκε. νῦν δὲ περὶ πτωχῶν ἐριδαίνομεν, οὐδέ τι δαιτὸς ἐσθλῆς ἔσσεται ἦδος, ἐπεὶ τὰ χερείονα νικᾷ.
"On this Telemakhos came forward and said, ""Sirs, are you mad? Can you not carry your meat and your liquor decently? Some evil spirit has possessed you. I do not wish to drive any of you away, but you have had your suppers, and the sooner you all go home to bed the better."""	τοῖσι δὲ καὶ μετέειφʼ ἱερὴ ἲς Τηλεμάχοιο δαιμόνιοι, μαίνεσθε καὶ οὐκέτι κεύθετε θυμῷ βρωτὺν οὐδὲ ποτῆτα· θεῶν νύ τις ὔμμʼ ὀροθύνει. ἀλλʼ εὖ δαισάμενοι κατακείετε οἴκαδʼ ἰόντες, ὁππότε θυμὸς ἄνωγε· διώκω δʼ οὔ τινʼ ἐγώ γε.
"The suitors bit their lips and marveled at the boldness of his speech; but Amphinomos the son of Nisus, who was son to Aretias, said, ""Do not let us take offense; it is reasonable  , so let us make no answer. Neither let us do violence to the stranger nor to any of Odysseus’ servants. Let the cupbearer go round with the drink-offerings, that we may make them and go home to our rest. As for the stranger, let us leave Telemakhos to deal with him, for it is to his house that he has come."""	ὣς ἔφαθʼ, οἱ δʼ ἄρα πάντες ὀδὰξ ἐν χείλεσι φύντες Τηλέμαχον θαύμαζον, ὃ θαρσαλέως ἀγόρευε. τοῖσιν δʼ Ἀμφίνομος ἀγορήσατο καὶ μετέειπε Νίσου φαίδιμος υἱός, Ἀρητιάδαο ἄνακτος· ὦ φίλοι, οὐκ ἂν δή τις ἐπὶ ῥηθέντι δικαίῳ ἀντιβίοις ἐπέεσσι καθαπτόμενος χαλεπαίνοι· μήτε τι τὸν ξεῖνον στυφελίζετε μήτε τινʼ ἄλλον δμώων, οἳ κατὰ δώματʼ Ὀδυσσῆος θείοιο. ἀλλʼ ἄγετʼ, οἰνοχόος μὲν ἐπαρξάσθω δεπάεσσιν, ὄφρα σπείσαντες κατακείομεν οἴκαδʼ ἰόντες· τὸν ξεῖνον δὲ ἐῶμεν ἐνὶ μεγάροις Ὀδυσῆος Τηλεμάχῳ μελέμεν· τοῦ γὰρ φίλον ἵκετο δῶμα.
Thus did he speak, and his saying pleased them well, so Moulios of Dulichium, servant to Amphinomos, mixed them a bowl of wine and water and handed it round to each of them man by man, whereon they made their drink-offerings to the blessed gods: Then, when they had made their drink-offerings and had drunk each one as he was minded, they took their several ways each of them to his own abode.	ὣς φάτο, τοῖσι δὲ πᾶσιν ἑαδότα μῦθον ἔειπε. τοῖσιν δὲ κρητῆρα κεράσσατο Μούλιος ἥρως, κῆρυξ Δουλιχιεύς· θεράπων δʼ ἦν Ἀμφινόμοιο· νώμησεν δʼ ἄρα πᾶσιν ἐπισταδόν· οἱ δὲ θεοῖσι σπείσαντες μακάρεσσι πίον μελιηδέα οἶνον. αὐτὰρ ἐπεὶ σπεῖσάν τʼ ἔπιόν θʼ ὅσον ἤθελε θυμός,
"Odysseus was left in the room, pondering on the means whereby with Athena's help he might be able to kill the suitors. Presently he said to Telemakhos, ""Telemakhos, we must get the armor together and take it down inside. Make some excuse when the suitors ask you why you have removed it. Say that you have taken it to be out of the way of the smoke, inasmuch as it is no longer what it was when Odysseus went away, but has become soiled and begrimed with soot. Add to this more particularly that you are afraid a may set them on to quarrel over their wine, and that they may do each other some harm which may disgrace both banquet and wooing, for the sight of arms sometimes tempts people to use them."""	αὐτὰρ ὁ ἐν μεγάρῳ ὑπελείπετο δῖος Ὀδυσσεύς, μνηστήρεσσι φόνον σὺν Ἀθήνῃ μερμηρίζων· αἶψα δὲ Τηλέμαχον ἔπεα πτερόεντα προσηύδα· Τηλέμαχε, χρὴ τεύχεʼ ἀρήϊα κατθέμεν εἴσω πάντα μάλʼ· αὐτὰρ μνηστῆρας μαλακοῖς ἐπέεσσι παρφάσθαι, ὅτε κέν σε μεταλλῶσιν ποθέοντες· ἐκ καπνοῦ κατέθηκʼ, ἐπεὶ οὐκέτι τοῖσιν ἐῴκει οἷά ποτε Τροίηνδε κιὼν κατέλειπεν Ὀδυσσεύς, ἀλλὰ κατῄκισται, ὅσσον πυρὸς ἵκετʼ ἀϋτμή. πρὸς δʼ ἔτι καὶ τόδε μεῖζον ἐνὶ φρεσὶν ἔβαλε δαίμων μή πως οἰνωθέντες, ἔριν στήσαντες ἐν ὑμῖν, ἀλλήλους τρώσητε καταισχύνητέ τε δαῖτα καὶ μνηστύν· αὐτὸς γὰρ ἐφέλκεται ἄνδρα σίδηρος.
"Telemakhos approved of what his father had said, so he called nurse Eurykleia and said, ""Nurse, shut the women up in their room, while I take the armor that my father left behind him down into the store room. No one looks after it now my father is gone, and it has got all smirched with soot during my own boyhood. I want to take it down where the smoke cannot reach it."""	ὣς φάτο, Τηλέμαχος δὲ φίλῳ ἐπεπείθετο πατρί, ἐκ δὲ καλεσσάμενος προσέφη τροφὸν Εὐρύκλειαν· μαῖʼ, ἄγε δή μοι ἔρυξον ἐνὶ μεγάροισι γυναῖκας, ὄφρα κεν ἐς θάλαμον καταθείομαι ἔντεα πατρὸς καλά, τά μοι κατὰ οἶκον ἀκηδέα καπνὸς ἀμέρδει πατρὸς ἀποιχομένοιο· ἐγὼ δʼ ἔτι νήπιος ἦα. νῦν δʼ ἐθέλω καταθέσθαι, ἵνʼ οὐ πυρὸς ἵξετʼ ἀϋτμή.
"""I wish, child,"" answered Eurykleia, ""that you would take the management of the house into your own hands altogether, and look after all the property yourself. But who is to go with you and light you to the store room? The maids would have so, but you would not let them."	τὸν δʼ αὖτε προσέειπε φίλη τροφὸς Εὐρύκλεια· αἲ γὰρ δή ποτε, τέκνον, ἐπιφροσύνας ἀνέλοιο οἴκου κήδεσθαι καὶ κτήματα πάντα φυλάσσειν. ἀλλʼ ἄγε, τίς τοι ἔπειτα μετοιχομένη φάος οἴσει; δμῳὰς δʼ οὐκ εἴας προβλωσκέμεν, αἵ κεν ἔφαινον.
"""The stranger,"" said Telemakhos, ""shall show me a light; when people eat my bread they must earn it, no matter where they come from."""	τὴν δʼ αὖ Τηλέμαχος πεπνυμένος ἀντίον ηὔδα· ξεῖνος ὅδʼ· οὐ γὰρ ἀεργὸν ἀνέξομαι ὅς κεν ἐμῆς γε χοίνικος ἅπτηται, καὶ τηλόθεν εἰληλουθώς.
"Eurykleia did as she was told, and bolted the women inside their room. Then Odysseus and his son made all haste to take the helmets, shields, and spears inside; and Athena went before them with a gold lamp in her hand that shed a soft and brilliant radiance, whereon Telemakhos said, ""Father, my eyes behold a great marvel: the walls, with the rafters, crossbeams, and the supports on which they rest are all aglow as with a flaming fire. Surely there is some god here who has come down from heaven."""	ὣς ἄρʼ ἐφώνησεν, τῇ δʼ ἄπτερος ἔπλετο μῦθος. κλήϊσεν δὲ θύρας μεγάρων εὖ ναιεταόντων. τὼ δʼ ἄρʼ ἀναΐξαντʼ Ὀδυσεὺς καὶ φαίδιμος υἱὸς ἐσφόρεον κόρυθάς τε καὶ ἀσπίδας ὀμφαλοέσσας ἔγχεά τʼ ὀξυόεντα· πάροιθε δὲ Παλλὰς Ἀθήνη, χρύσεον λύχνον ἔχουσα, φάος περικαλλὲς ἐποίει. δὴ τότε Τηλέμαχος προσεφώνεεν ὃν πατέρʼ αἶψα· ὦ πάτερ, ἦ μέγα θαῦμα τόδʼ ὀφθαλμοῖσιν ὁρῶμαι. ἔμπης μοι τοῖχοι μεγάρων καλαί τε μεσόδμαι, εἰλάτιναί τε δοκοί, καὶ κίονες ὑψόσʼ ἔχοντες φαίνοντʼ ὀφθαλμοῖς ὡς εἰ πυρὸς αἰθομένοιο. ἦ μάλα τις θεὸς ἔνδον, οἳ οὐρανὸν εὐρὺν ἔχουσι.
"""Hush,"" answered Odysseus, ""hold your in peace and ask no questions, for this is the manner   of the gods. Get you to your bed, and leave me here to talk with your mother and the maids. Your mother in her grief will ask me all sorts of questions."""	τὸν δʼ ἀπαμειβόμενος προσέφη πολύμητις Ὀδυσσεύς· σίγα καὶ κατὰ σὸν νόον ἴσχανε μηδʼ ἐρέεινε· αὕτη τοι δίκη ἐστὶ θεῶν, οἳ Ὄλυμπον ἔχουσιν. ἀλλὰ σὺ μὲν κατάλεξαι, ἐγὼ δʼ ὑπολείψομαι αὐτοῦ, ὄφρα κʼ ἔτι δμῳὰς καὶ μητέρα σὴν ἐρεθίζω· ἡ δέ μʼ ὀδυρομένη εἰρήσεται ἀμφὶς ἕκαστα.
On this Telemakhos went by torch-light to the other side of the inner court, to the room in which he always slept. There he lay in his bed till morning, while Odysseus was left in the room pondering on the means whereby with Athena's help he might be able to kill the suitors.	ὣς φάτο, Τηλέμαχος δὲ διὲκ μεγάροιο βεβήκει κείων ἐς θάλαμον, δαΐδων ὕπο λαμπομενάων, ἔνθα πάρος κοιμᾶθʼ, ὅτε μιν γλυκὺς ὕπνος ἱκάνοι· ἔνθʼ ἄρα καὶ τότʼ ἔλεκτο καὶ Ἠῶ δῖαν ἔμιμνεν. αὐτὰρ ὁ ἐν μεγάρῳ ὑπελείπετο δῖος Ὀδυσσεύς, μνηστήρεσσι φόνον σὺν Ἀθήνῃ μερμηρίζων.
"Then Penelope came down from her room looking like Aphrodite or Artemis, and they set her a seat inlaid with scrolls of silver and ivory near the fire in her accustomed place. It had been made by Ikmalios and had a footstool all in one piece with the seat itself; and it was covered with a thick fleece: on this she now sat, and the maids came from the women's room to join her. They set about removing the tables at which the wicked suitors had been dining, and took away the bread that was left, with the cups from which they had drunk. They emptied the embers out of the braziers, and heaped much wood upon them to give both light and heat; but Melantho began to rail at Odysseus a second time and said, ""Stranger, do you mean to plague us by hanging about the house all night and spying upon the women? Be off, you wretch, outside, and eat your supper there, or you shall be driven out with a firebrand."""	ἡ δʼ ἴεν ἐκ θαλάμοιο περίφρων Πηνελόπεια, Ἀρτέμιδι ἰκέλη ἠὲ χρυσέῃ Ἀφροδίτῃ. τῇ παρὰ μὲν κλισίην πυρὶ κάτθεσαν, ἔνθʼ ἄρʼ ἐφῖζε, δινωτὴν ἐλέφαντι καὶ ἀργύρῳ· ἥν ποτε τέκτων ποίησʼ Ἰκμάλιος, καὶ ὑπὸ θρῆνυν ποσὶν ἧκε προσφυέʼ ἐξ αὐτῆς, ὅθʼ ἐπὶ μέγα βάλλετο κῶας. ἔνθα καθέζετʼ ἔπειτα περίφρων Πηνελόπεια. ἦλθον δὲ δμῳαὶ λευκώλενοι ἐκ μεγάροιο. αἱ δʼ ἀπὸ μὲν σῖτον πολὺν ᾕρεον ἠδὲ τραπέζας καὶ δέπα, ἔνθεν ἄρʼ ἄνδρες ὑπερμενέοντες ἔπινον· πῦρ δʼ ἀπὸ λαμπτήρων χαμάδις βάλον, ἄλλα δʼ ἐπʼ αὐτῶν νήησαν ξύλα πολλά, φόως ἔμεν ἠδὲ θέρεσθαι. ἡ δʼ Ὀδυσῆʼ ἐνένιπε Μελανθὼ δεύτερον αὖτις· ξεῖνʼ, ἔτι καὶ νῦν ἐνθάδʼ ἀνιήσεις διὰ νύκτα δινεύων κατὰ οἶκον, ὀπιπεύσεις δὲ γυναῖκας; ἀλλʼ ἔξελθε θύραζε, τάλαν, καὶ δαιτὸς ὄνησο· ἢ τάχα καὶ δαλῷ βεβλημένος εἶσθα θύραζε.
"Odysseus scowled at her and answered, ""My good woman, why should you be so angry with me? Is it because I am not clean, and my clothes are all in rags, and because I am obliged to go begging about the after the manner of tramps and beggars general? I too was a rich   man once, and had a fine house of my own; in those days I gave to many a tramp such as I now am, no matter who he might be nor what he wanted. I had any number of servants, and all the other things which people have who live well and are accounted wealthy, but it pleased Zeus to take all away from me; therefore, woman, beware lest you too come to lose that pride and place in which you now wanton above your fellows; have a care lest you get out of favor with your mistress, and lest Odysseus should come home, for there is still a chance that he may do so. Moreover, though he be dead as you think he is, yet by Apollo's will he has left a son behind him, Telemakhos, who will note anything done amiss by the maids in the house, for he is now no longer in his boyhood."""	τὴν δʼ ἄρʼ ὑπόδρα ἰδὼν προσέφη πολύμητις Ὀδυσσεύς· δαιμονίη, τί μοι ὧδʼ ἐπέχεις κεκοτηότι θυμῷ; ἦ ὅτι δὴ ῥυπόω, κακὰ δὲ χροῒ εἵματα εἷμαι, πτωχεύω δʼ ἀνὰ δῆμον; ἀναγκαίη γὰρ ἐπείγει. τοιοῦτοι πτωχοὶ καὶ ἀλήμονες ἄνδρες ἔασι καὶ γὰρ ἐγώ ποτε οἶκον ἐν ἀνθρώποισιν ἔναιον ὄλβιος ἀφνειὸν καὶ πολλάκι δόσκον ἀλήτῃ, τοίῳ ὁποῖος ἔοι καὶ ὅτευ κεχρημένος ἔλθοι· ἦσαν δὲ δμῶες μάλα μυρίοι, ἄλλα τε πολλὰ οἷσίν τʼ εὖ ζώουσι καὶ ἀφνειοὶ καλέονται. ἀλλὰ Ζεὺς ἀλάπαξε Κρονίων· ἤθελε γάρ που· τῷ νῦν μήποτε καὶ σύ, γύναι, ἀπὸ πᾶσαν ὀλέσσῃς ἀγλαΐην, τῇ νῦν γε μετὰ δμῳῇσι κέκασσαι· μή πώς τοι δέσποινα κοτεσσαμένη χαλεπήνῃ, ἢ Ὀδυσεὺς ἔλθῃ· ἔτι γὰρ καὶ ἐλπίδος αἶσα. εἰ δʼ ὁ μὲν ὣς ἀπόλωλε καὶ οὐκέτι νόστιμός ἐστιν, ἀλλʼ ἤδη παῖς τοῖος Ἀπόλλωνός γε ἕκητι, Τηλέμαχος· τὸν δʼ οὔ τις ἐνὶ μεγάροισι γυναικῶν λήθει ἀτασθάλλουσʼ, ἐπεὶ οὐκέτι τηλίκος ἐστίν.
"Penelope heard what he was saying and scolded the maid, ""Impudent baggage,"" said she, ""I see how abominably you are behaving, and you shall smart for it. You knew perfectly well, for I told you myself, that I was going to see the stranger and ask him about my husband, for whose sake I am in such continual sorrow."""	ὣς φάτο, τοῦ δʼ ἤκουσε περίφρων Πηνελόπεια, ἀμφίπολον δʼ ἐνένιπεν ἔπος τʼ ἔφατʼ ἔκ τʼ ὀνόμαζε· πάντως, θαρσαλέη, κύον ἀδεές, οὔ τί με λήθεις ἔρδουσα μέγα ἔργον, ὃ σῇ κεφαλῇ ἀναμάξεις· πάντα γὰρ εὖ ᾔδησθʼ, ἐπεὶ ἐξ ἐμεῦ ἔκλυες αὐτῆς ὡς τὸν ξεῖνον ἔμελλον ἐνὶ μεγάροισιν ἐμοῖσιν ἀμφὶ πόσει εἴρεσθαι, ἐπεὶ πυκινῶς ἀκάχημαι.
"Then she said to her head waiting woman Eurynome, ""Bring a seat with a fleece upon it, for the stranger to sit upon while he tells his story, and listens to what I have to say. I wish to ask him some questions."""	ἦ ῥα καὶ Εὐρυνόμην ταμίην πρὸς μῦθον ἔειπεν· Εὐρυνόμη, φέρε δὴ δίφρον καὶ κῶας ἐπʼ αὐτοῦ, ὄφρα καθεζόμενος εἴπῃ ἔπος ἠδʼ ἐπακούσῃ ὁ ξεῖνος ἐμέθεν· ἐθέλω δέ μιν ἐξερέεσθαι.
"Eurynome brought the seat at once and set a fleece upon it, and as soon as Odysseus had sat down Penelope began by saying, ""Stranger, I shall first ask you who and whence are you? Tell me of your town and parents."""	ὣς ἔφαθʼ, ἡ δὲ μάλʼ ὀτραλέως κατέθηκε φέρουσα δίφρον ἐΰξεστον καὶ ἐπʼ αὐτῷ κῶας ἔβαλλεν· ἔνθα καθέζετʼ ἔπειτα πολύτλας δῖος Ὀδυσσεύς. τοῖσι δὲ μύθων ἦρχε περίφρων Πηνελόπεια· ξεῖνε, τὸ μέν σε πρῶτον ἐγὼν εἰρήσομαι αὐτή· τίς πόθεν εἶς ἀνδρῶν; πόθι τοι πόλις ἠδὲ τοκῆες;
"""Lady;"" answered Odysseus, ""who on the face of the whole earth can dare to chide with you? Your fame   reaches the firmament of heaven itself; you are like some blameless king, who upholds righteousness, as the monarch over a great and valiant nation: the earth yields its wheat and barley, the trees are loaded with fruit, the ewes bring forth lambs, and the sea abounds with fish by reason of his virtues, and his people do good deeds under him. Nevertheless, as I sit here in your house, ask me some other question and do not seek to know my race and family, or you will recall memories that will yet more increase my sorrow. I am full of heaviness, but I ought not to sit weeping and wailing in another person's house, nor is it well to be thus grieving continually. I shall have one of the servants or even yourself complaining of me, and saying that my eyes swim with tears because I am heavy with wine."""	τὴν δʼ ἀπαμειβόμενος προσέφη πολύμητις Ὀδυσσεύς· ὦ γύναι, οὐκ ἄν τίς σε βροτῶν ἐπʼ ἀπείρονα γαῖαν νεικέοι· ἦ γάρ σευ κλέος οὐρανὸν εὐρὺν ἱκάνει, ὥς τέ τευ ἢ βασιλῆος ἀμύμονος, ὅς τε θεουδὴς ἀνδράσιν ἐν πολλοῖσι καὶ ἰφθίμοισιν ἀνάσσων εὐδικίας ἀνέχῃσι, φέρῃσι δὲ γαῖα μέλαινα πυροὺς καὶ κριθάς, βρίθῃσι δὲ δένδρεα καρπῷ, τίκτῃ δʼ ἔμπεδα μῆλα, θάλασσα δὲ παρέχῃ ἰχθῦς ἐξ εὐηγεσίης, ἀρετῶσι δὲ λαοὶ ὑπʼ αὐτοῦ. τῷ ἐμὲ νῦν τὰ μὲν ἄλλα μετάλλα σῷ ἐνὶ οἴκῳ, μηδʼ ἐμὸν ἐξερέεινε γένος καὶ πατρίδα γαῖαν, μή μοι μᾶλλον θυμὸν ἐνιπλήσῃς ὀδυνάων μνησαμένῳ μάλα δʼ εἰμὶ πολύστονος· οὐδέ τί με χρὴ οἴκῳ ἐν ἀλλοτρίῳ γοόωντά τε μυρόμενόν τε ἧσθαι, ἐπεὶ κάκιον πενθήμεναι ἄκριτον αἰεί· μή τίς μοι δμῳῶν νεμεσήσεται, ἠὲ σύ γʼ αὐτή, φῇ δὲ δακρυπλώειν βεβαρηότα με φρένας οἴνῳ.
"Then Penelope answered, ""Stranger, the immortal gods robbed me of all , whether of face or figure, when the Argives set sail for Troy and my dear husband with them. If he were to return and look after my affairs I should be both more respected   and should show a better presence to the world. As it is, I am oppressed with care, and with the afflictions which a has seen fit to heap upon me. The chiefs from all our islands - Dulichium, Same, and Zacynthus , as also from Ithaca itself, are wooing me against my will and are wasting my estate. I can therefore show no attention to strangers, nor suppliants, nor to people who say that they are skilled artisans, but am all the time brokenhearted about Odysseus. They want me to marry again at once, and I have to invent stratagems in order to deceive them. In the first place a put it in my mind to set up a great tambour-frame in my room, and to begin working upon an enormous piece of fine needlework. Then I said to them, ‘Sweethearts, Odysseus is indeed dead, still, do not press me to marry again immediately; wait - for I would not have my skill in needlework perish unrecorded - till I have finished making a shroud for the hero Laertes , to be ready against the time when death shall take him. He is very rich, and the women of the will talk if he is laid out without a shroud.’ This was what I said, and they assented; whereon I used to keep working at my great web all day long, but at night I would unpick the stitches again by torch light. I fooled them in this way for three years without their finding it out, but as time   wore on and I was now in my fourth year, in the waning of moons, and many days had been accomplished, those good-for-nothing hussies my maids betrayed me to the suitors, who broke in upon me and caught me; they were very angry with me, so I was forced to finish my work whether I would or no. And now I do not see how I can find any further shift for getting out of this marriage. My parents are putting great pressure upon me, and my son chafes at the ravages the suitors are making upon his estate, for he is now old enough to understand all about it and is perfectly able to look after his own affairs, for heaven has blessed him with an excellent disposition. Still, notwithstanding all this, tell me who you are and where you come from - for you must have had father and mother of some sort; you cannot be the son of an oak or of a rock."""	τὸν δʼ ἠμείβετʼ ἔπειτα περίφρων Πηνελόπεια· ξεῖνʼ, ἦ τοι μὲν ἐμὴν ἀρετὴν εἶδός τε δέμας τε ὤλεσαν ἀθάνατοι, ὅτε Ἴλιον εἰσανέβαινον Ἀργεῖοι, μετὰ τοῖσι δʼ ἐμὸς πόσις ᾖεν Ὀδυσσεύς εἰ κεῖνός γʼ ἐλθὼν τὸν ἐμὸν βίον ἀμφιπολεύοι, μεῖζον κε κλέος εἴη ἐμὸν καὶ κάλλιον οὕτως. νῦν δʼ ἄχομαι· τόσα γάρ μοι ἐπέσσευεν κακὰ δαίμων. ὅσσοι γὰρ νήσοισιν ἐπικρατέουσιν ἄριστοι, Δουλιχίῳ τε Σάμῃ τε καὶ ὑλήεντι Ζακύνθῳ, οἵ τʼ αὐτὴν Ἰθάκην εὐδείελον ἀμφινέμονται, οἵ μʼ ἀεκαζομένην μνῶνται, τρύχουσι δὲ οἶκον. τῷ οὔτε ξείνων ἐμπάξομαι οὔθʼ ἱκετάων οὔτε τι κηρύκων, οἳ δημιοεργοὶ ἔασιν· ἀλλʼ Ὀδυσῆ ποθέουσα φίλον κατατήκομαι ἦτορ. οἱ δὲ γάμον σπεύδουσιν· ἐγὼ δὲ δόλους τολυπεύω. φᾶρος μέν μοι πρῶτον ἐνέπνευσε φρεσὶ δαίμων, στησαμένῃ μέγαν ἱστόν, ἐνὶ μεγάροισιν ὑφαίνειν, λεπτὸν καὶ περίμετρον· ἄφαρ δʼ αὐτοῖς μετέειπον· κοῦροι, ἐμοὶ μνηστῆρες, ἐπεὶ θάνε δῖος Ὀδυσσεύς, μίμνετʼ ἐπειγόμενοι τὸν ἐμὸν γάμον, εἰς ὅ κε φᾶρος ἐκτελέσω—μή μοι μεταμώνια νήματʼ ὄληται— Λαέρτῃ ἥρωϊ ταφήϊον, εἰς ὅτε κέν μιν μοῖρʼ ὀλοὴ καθέλῃσι τανηλεγέος θανάτοιο· μή τίς μοι κατὰ δῆμον Ἀχαιϊάδων νεμεσήσῃ, αἴ κεν ἄτερ σπείρου κεῖται πολλὰ κτεατίσσας. ὣς ἐφάμην, τοῖσιν δʼ ἐπεπείθετο θυμὸς ἀγήνωρ. ἔνθα καὶ ἠματίη μὲν ὑφαίνεσκον μέγαν ἱστόν, νύκτας δʼ ἀλλύεσκον, ἐπεὶ δαΐδας παραθείμην. ὣς τρίετες μὲν ἔληθον ἐγὼ καὶ ἔπειθον Ἀχαιούς· ἀλλʼ ὅτε τέτρατον ἦλθεν ἔτος καὶ ἐπήλυθον ὧραι, μηνῶν φθινόντων, περὶ δʼ ἤματα πόλλʼ ἐτελέσθη, καὶ τότε δή με διὰ δμῳάς, κύνας οὐκ ἀλεγούσας, εἷλον ἐπελθόντες καὶ ὁμόκλησαν ἐπέεσσιν. ὣς τὸ μὲν ἐξετέλεσσα, καὶ οὐκ ἐθέλουσʼ, ὑπʼ ἀνάγκης· νῦν δʼ οὔτʼ ἐκφυγέειν δύναμαι γάμον οὔτε τινʼ ἄλλην μῆτιν ἔθʼ εὑρίσκω· μάλα δʼ ὀτρύνουσι τοκῆες γήμασθʼ, ἀσχαλάᾳ δὲ πάϊς βίοτον κατεδόντων, γιγνώσκων· ἤδη γὰρ ἀνὴρ οἶός τε μάλιστα οἴκου κήδεσθαι, τῷ τε Ζεὺς κῦδος ὀπάζει. ἀλλὰ καὶ ὥς μοι εἰπὲ τεὸν γένος, ὁππόθεν ἐσσί. οὐ γὰρ ἀπὸ δρυός ἐσσι παλαιφάτου οὐδʼ ἀπὸ πέτρης.
"Then Odysseus answered, ""Lady, wife of Odysseus, since you persist in asking me about my family, I will answer, no matter what it costs me: people must expect to be pained   when they have been exiles as long as I have, and suffered as much among as many peoples. Nevertheless, as regards your question I will tell you all you ask. There is a fair and fruitful island in mid-ocean called Crete ; it is thickly peopled and there are ninety cities in it: the people speak many different languages which overlap one another, for there are Achaeans, brave Eteocretans, Dorians of three-fold race, and noble Pelasgi. There is a great town there, Knossos , where Minos reigned who every nine years had a conference with Zeus himself. Minos was father to Deukalion, whose son I am, for Deukalion had two sons Idomeneus and myself. Idomeneus sailed for Troy , and I, who am the younger, am called Aithon; my brother, however, was at once the older and the more valiant of the two; hence it was in Crete that I saw Odysseus and showed him hospitality, for the winds took him there as he was on his way to Troy , carrying him out of his course from cape Malea and leaving him in Amnisos off the cave of Eileithuia, where the harbors are difficult to enter and he could hardly find shelter from the winds that were then raging. As soon as he got there he went into the town and asked for Idomeneus, claiming to be his old and valued friend, but Idomeneus had already set sail for Troy some ten or twelve days earlier, so I took him to my own house and showed him every kind of hospitality, for I had abundance of everything. Moreover, I fed the men who were with him with barley meal from the public store, and got subscriptions of wine and oxen for them to sacrifice to their heart's content. They stayed with me twelve days, for there was a gale blowing from the North so strong that one could hardly keep one's feet on land. I suppose some unfriendly had raised it for them, but on the thirteenth day the wind dropped, and they got away."""	τὴν δʼ ἀπαμειβόμενος προσέφη πολύμητις Ὀδυσσεύς· ὦ γύναι αἰδοίη Λαερτιάδεω Ὀδυσῆος, οὐκέτʼ ἀπολλήξεις τὸν ἐμὸν γόνον ἐξερέουσα; ἀλλʼ ἔκ τοι ἐρέω· ἦ μέν μʼ ἀχέεσσί γε δώσεις πλείοσιν ἢ ἔχομαι· ἡ γὰρ δίκη, ὁππότε πάτρης ἧς ἀπέῃσιν ἀνὴρ τόσσον χρόνον ὅσσον ἐγὼ νῦν, πολλὰ βροτῶν ἐπὶ ἄστεʼ ἀλώμενος, ἄλγεα πάσχων· ἀλλὰ καὶ ὣς ἐρέω ὅ μʼ ἀνείρεαι ἠδὲ μεταλλᾷς.

"Many a plausible tale did Odysseus further tell her, and Penelope wept as she listened, for her heart was melted. As the snow wastes upon the mountain tops when the winds from South East and West have breathed upon it and thawed it till the rivers run bank full with water, even so did her cheeks overflow with tears for the husband who was all the time sitting by her side. Odysseus felt for her and was for her, but he kept his eyes as hard as or iron without letting them so much as quiver, so cunningly did he restrain his tears. Then, when she had relieved herself by weeping, she turned to him again and said: ""Now, stranger, I shall put you to the test and see whether or not you really did entertain my husband and his men, as you say you did. Tell me, then, how he was dressed, what kind of a man he was to look at, and so also with his companions."""	ἴσκε ψεύδεα πολλὰ λέγων ἐτύμοισιν ὁμοῖα· τῆς δʼ ἄρʼ ἀκουούσης ῥέε δάκρυα, τήκετο δὲ χρώς· ὡς δὲ χιὼν κατατήκετʼ ἐν ἀκροπόλοισιν ὄρεσσιν, ἥν τʼ Εὖρος κατέτηξεν, ἐπὴν Ζέφυρος καταχεύῃ· τηκομένης δʼ ἄρα τῆς ποταμοὶ πλήθουσι ῥέοντες· ὣς τῆς τήκετο καλὰ παρήϊα δάκρυ χεούσης, κλαιούσης ἑὸν ἄνδρα παρήμενον. αὐτὰρ Ὀδυσσεὺς θυμῷ μὲν γοόωσαν ἑὴν ἐλέαιρε γυναῖκα, ὀφθαλμοὶ δʼ ὡς εἰ κέρα ἕστασαν ἠὲ σίδηρος ἀτρέμας ἐν βλεφάροισι· δόλῳ δʼ ὅ γε δάκρυα κεῦθεν. ἡ δʼ ἐπεὶ οὖν τάρφθη πολυδακρύτοιο γόοιο, ἐξαῦτίς μιν ἔπεσσιν ἀμειβομένη προσέειπε· νῦν μὲν δή σευ, ξεῖνέ γʼ, ὀΐω πειρήσεσθαι, εἰ ἐτεὸν δὴ κεῖθι σὺν ἀντιθέοις ἑτάροισι ξείνισας ἐν μεγάροισιν ἐμὸν πόσιν, ὡς ἀγορεύεις. εἰπέ μοι ὁπποῖʼ ἄσσα περὶ χροῒ εἵματα ἕστο, αὐτός θʼ οἷος ἔην, καὶ ἑταίρους, οἵ οἱ ἕποντο.
"""Lady,"" answered Odysseus, ""it is such a long time ago that I can hardly say. Twenty years are come and gone since he left my home, and went elsewhere; but I will tell you as well as I can recollect. Odysseus wore a mantle of purple wool, double lined, and it was fastened by a gold brooch with two catches for the pin. On the face of this there was a device that showed a dog holding a spotted fawn between his fore paws, and watching it as it lay panting upon the ground. Every one marveled at the way in which these things had been done in gold, the dog looking at the fawn, and strangling it, while the fawn was struggling convulsively to escape. As for the shirt that he wore next his skin, it was so soft that it fitted him like the skin of an onion, and glistened in the sunlight to the admiration of all the women who beheld it. Furthermore I say, and lay my saying to your heart, that I do not know whether Odysseus wore these clothes when he left home, or whether one of his companions had given them to him while he was on his voyage; or possibly some one at whose house he was staying made him a present of them, for he was a man of many friends and had few equals among the Achaeans. I myself gave him a sword of bronze and a beautiful purple mantle, double lined, with a shirt that went down to his feet, and I sent him on board his ship with every mark of honor. He had a servant with him, a little older than himself, and I can tell you what he was like; his shoulders were hunched, he was dark, and he had thick curly hair. His name was Eurybates, and Odysseus treated him with greater familiarity than he did any of the others, as being the most like-minded with himself."""	τὴν δʼ ἀπαμειβόμενος προσέφη πολύμητις Ὀδυσσεύς· ὦ γύναι, ἀργαλέον τόσσον χρόνον ἀμφὶς ἐόντα εἰπέμεν· ἤδη γάρ οἱ ἐεικοστὸν ἔτος ἐστὶν ἐξ οὗ κεῖθεν ἔβη καὶ ἐμῆς ἀπελήλυθε πάτρης· αὐτάρ τοι ἐρέω ὥς μοι ἰνδάλλεται ἦτορ. χλαῖναν πορφυρέην οὔλην ἔχε δῖος Ὀδυσσεύς, διπλῆν· αὐτάρ οἱ περόνη χρυσοῖο τέτυκτο αὐλοῖσιν διδύμοισι· πάροιθε δὲ δαίδαλον ἦεν· ἐν προτέροισι πόδεσσι κύων ἔχε ποικίλον ἐλλόν, ἀσπαίροντα λάων· τὸ δὲ θαυμάζεσκον ἅπαντες, ὡς οἱ χρύσεοι ἐόντες ὁ μὲν λάε νεβρὸν ἀπάγχων, αὐτὰρ ὁ ἐκφυγέειν μεμαὼς ἤσπαιρε πόδεσσι. τὸν δὲ χιτῶνʼ ἐνόησα περὶ χροῒ σιγαλόεντα, οἷόν τε κρομύοιο λοπὸν κάτα ἰσχαλέοιο· τὼς μὲν ἔην μαλακός, λαμπρὸς δʼ ἦν ἠέλιος ὥς· ἦ μὲν πολλαί γʼ αὐτὸν ἐθηήσαντο γυναῖκες. ἄλλο δέ τοι ἐρέω, σὺ δʼ ἐνὶ φρεσὶ βάλλεο σῇσιν· οὐκ οἶδʼ ἢ τάδε ἕστο περὶ χροῒ οἴκοθʼ Ὀδυσσεύς, ἦ τις ἑταίρων δῶκε θοῆς ἐπὶ νηὸς ἰόντι, ἤ τίς που καὶ ξεῖνος, ἐπεὶ πολλοῖσιν Ὀδυσσεὺς ἔσκε φίλος· παῦροι γὰρ Ἀχαιῶν ἦσαν ὁμοῖοι. καί οἱ ἐγὼ χάλκειον ἄορ καὶ δίπλακα δῶκα καλὴν πορφυρέην καὶ τερμιόεντα χιτῶνα, αἰδοίως δʼ ἀπέπεμπον ἐϋσσέλμου ἐπὶ νηός. καὶ μέν οἱ κῆρυξ ὀλίγον προγενέστερος αὐτοῦ εἵπετο· καὶ τόν τοι μυθήσομαι, οἷος ἔην περ. γυρὸς ἐν ὤμοισιν, μελανόχροος, οὐλοκάρηνος, Εὐρυβάτης δʼ ὄνομʼ ἔσκε· τίεν δέ μιν ἔξοχον ἄλλων ὧν ἑτάρων Ὀδυσεύς, ὅτι οἱ φρεσὶν ἄρτια ᾔδη.
"Penelope was moved still more deeply as she heard the indisputable proofs   that Odysseus laid before her; and when she had again found relief in tears she said to him, ""Stranger, I was already disposed to pity you, but henceforth you shall be honored and made welcome in my house. It was I who gave Odysseus the clothes you speak of. I took them out of the store room and folded them up myself, and I gave him also the gold brooch to wear as an ornament. Alas! I shall never welcome him home again. It was by an ill fate that he ever set out for that detested city whose very name I cannot bring myself even to mention."""	ὣς φάτο, τῇ δʼ ἔτι μᾶλλον ὑφʼ ἵμερον ὦρσε γόοιο, σήματʼ ἀναγνούσῃ τά οἱ ἔμπεδα πέφραδʼ Ὀδυσσεύς. ἡ δʼ ἐπεὶ οὖν τάρφθη πολυδακρύτοιο γόοιο. καὶ τότε μιν μύθοισιν ἀμειβομένη προσέειπε· νῦν μὲν δή μοι, ξεῖνε, πάρος περ ἐὼν ἐλεεινός, ἐν μεγάροισιν ἐμοῖσι φίλος τʼ ἔσῃ αἰδοῖός τε· αὐτὴ γὰρ τάδε εἵματʼ ἐγὼ πόρον, οἷʼ ἀγορεύεις, πτύξασʼ ἐκ θαλάμου, περόνην τʼ ἐπέθηκα φαεινὴν κείνῳ ἄγαλμʼ ἔμεναι· τὸν δʼ οὐχ ὑποδέξομαι αὖτις οἴκαδε νοστήσαντα φίλην ἐς πατρίδα γαῖαν. τῷ ῥα κακῇ αἴσῃ κοίλης ἐπὶ νηὸς Ὀδυσσεὺς ᾤχετʼ ἐποψόμενος Κακοΐλιον οὐκ ὀνομαστήν.
"Then Odysseus answered, ""Lady, wife of Odysseus, do not disfigure yourself further by grieving thus bitterly for your loss, though I can hardly blame you for doing so. A woman who has loved her husband and borne him children, would naturally be grieved at losing him, even though he were a worse man than Odysseus, who they say was like a god. Still, cease your tears and listen to what I can tell. I will hide nothing from you, and can say with perfect truth that I have lately heard of Odysseus as being alive and on his way home  ; he is in the district   of the Thesprotians, and is bringing back much valuable treasure that he has begged from one and another of them; but his ship and all his crew were lost as they were leaving the Thrinacian island, for Zeus and the sun-god were angry with him because his men had slaughtered the sun-god's cattle, and they were all drowned to a man. But Odysseus stuck to the keel of the ship and was drifted on to the land of the Phaeacians, who are near of kin to the immortals, and who treated him as though he had been a god, giving him many presents, and wishing to escort him home safe and sound. In fact Odysseus would have been here long ago, had he not thought better to go from land to land gathering wealth; for there is no man living who is so wily   as he is; there is no one can compare with him. Pheidon king of the Thesprotians told me all this, and he swore to me - making drink-offerings in his house as he did so - that the ship was by the water side and the crew found who would take Odysseus to his own country. He sent me off first, for there happened to be a Thesprotian ship sailing for the wheat-growing island of Dulichium, but he showed me all the treasure Odysseus had got together, and he had enough lying in the house of king Pheidon to keep his family for ten generations; but the king said Odysseus had gone to Dodona that he might learn Zeus’ mind from the high oak tree, and know whether after so long an absence he should return to Ithaca openly or in secret. So you may know he is safe and will be here shortly; he is close at hand and cannot remain away from home much longer; nevertheless I will confirm my words with an oath, and call Zeus who is the first and mightiest of all gods to witness, as also that hearth of Odysseus to which I have now come, that all I have spoken shall surely come to pass. Odysseus will return in this self same year; with the end of this moon and the beginning of the next he will be here."""	τὴν δʼ ἀπαμειβόμενος προσέφη πολύμητις Ὀδυσσεύς· ὦ γύναι αἰδοίη Λαερτιάδεω Ὀδυσῆος, μηκέτι νῦν χρόα καλὸν ἐναίρεο, μηδέ τι θυμὸν τῆκε, πόσιν γοόωσα. νεμεσσῶμαί γε μὲν οὐδέν· καὶ γάρ τίς τʼ ἀλλοῖον ὀδύρεται ἄνδρʼ ὀλέσασα κουρίδιον, τῷ τέκνα τέκῃ φιλότητι μιγεῖσα, ἢ Ὀδυσῆʼ, ὅν φασι θεοῖς ἐναλίγκιον εἶναι. ἀλλὰ γόου μὲν παῦσαι, ἐμεῖο δὲ σύνθεο μῦθον· νημερτέως γάρ τοι μυθήσομαι οὐδʼ ἐπικεύσω ὡς ἤδη Ὀδυσῆος ἐγὼ περὶ νόστου ἄκουσα ἀγχοῦ, Θεσπρωτῶν ἀνδρῶν ἐν πίονι δήμῳ, ζωοῦ· αὐτὰρ ἄγει κειμήλια πολλὰ καὶ ἐσθλὰ αἰτίζων ἀνὰ δῆμον. ἀτὰρ ἐρίηρας ἑταίρους ὤλεσε καὶ νῆα γλαφυρὴν ἐνὶ οἴνοπι πόντῳ, Θρινακίης ἄπο νήσου ἰών· ὀδύσαντο γὰρ αὐτῷ Ζεύς τε καὶ Ἠέλιος· τοῦ γὰρ βόας ἔκταν ἑταῖροι. οἱ μὲν πάντες ὄλοντο πολυκλύστῳ ἐνὶ πόντῳ· τὸν δʼ ἄρʼ ἐπὶ τρόπιος νεὸς ἔκβαλε κῦμʼ ἐπὶ χέρσου, Φαιήκων ἐς γαῖαν, οἳ ἀγχίθεοι γεγάασιν, οἳ δή μιν περὶ κῆρι θεὸν ὣς τιμήσαντο καί οἱ πολλὰ δόσαν πέμπειν τέ μιν ἤθελον αὐτοὶ οἴκαδʼ ἀπήμαντον. καί κεν πάλαι ἐνθάδʼ Ὀδυσσεὺς ἤην· ἀλλʼ ἄρα οἱ τό γε κέρδιον εἴσατο θυμῷ, χρήματʼ ἀγυρτάζειν πολλὴν ἐπὶ γαῖαν ἰόντι· ὣς περὶ κέρδεα πολλὰ καταθνητῶν ἀνθρώπων οἶδʼ Ὀδυσεύς, οὐδʼ ἄν τις ἐρίσσειε βροτὸς ἄλλος. ὥς μοι Θεσπρωτῶν βασιλεὺς μυθήσατο Φείδων· ὤμνυε δὲ πρὸς ἔμʼ αὐτόν, ἀποσπένδων ἐνὶ οἴκῳ, νῆα κατειρύσθαι καὶ ἐπαρτέας ἔμμεν ἑταίρους, οἳ δή μιν πέμψουσι φίλην ἐς πατρίδα γαῖαν. ἀλλʼ ἐμὲ πρὶν ἀπέπεμψε· τύχησε γὰρ ἐρχομένη νηῦς ἀνδρῶν Θεσπρωτῶν ἐς Δουλίχιον πολύπυρον. καί μοι κτήματʼ ἔδειξεν, ὅσα ξυναγείρατʼ Ὀδυσσεύς· καί νύ κεν ἐς δεκάτην γενεὴν ἕτερόν γʼ ἔτι βόσκοι, ὅσσα οἱ ἐν μεγάροις κειμήλια κεῖτο ἄνακτος. τὸν δʼ ἐς Δωδώνην φάτο βήμεναι, ὄφρα θεοῖο ἐκ δρυὸς ὑψικόμοιο Διὸς βουλὴν ἐπακούσαι, ὅππως νοστήσειε φίλην ἐς πατρίδα γαῖαν ἤδη δὴν ἀπεών, ἤ ἀμφαδὸν ἦε κρυφηδόν. ὣς ὁ μὲν οὕτως ἐστὶ σόος καὶ ἐλεύσεται ἤδη ἄγχι μάλʼ, οὐδʼ ἔτι τῆλε φίλων καὶ πατρίδος αἴης δηρὸν ἀπεσσεῖται· ἔμπης δέ τοι ὅρκια δώσω. ἴστω νῦν Ζεὺς πρῶτα, θεῶν ὕπατος καὶ ἄριστος, ἱστίη τʼ Ὀδυσῆος ἀμύμονος, ἣν ἀφικάνω· ἦ μέν τοι τάδε πάντα τελείεται ὡς ἀγορεύω. τοῦδʼ αὐτοῦ λυκάβαντος ἐλεύσεται ἐνθάδʼ Ὀδυσσεύς, τοῦ μὲν φθίνοντος μηνός, τοῦ δʼ ἱσταμένοιο.
"""May it be even so,"" answered Penelope; ""if your words come true you shall have such gifts and such good will from me that all who see you shall congratulate you; but I know very well how it will be. Odysseus will not return, neither will you get your escort hence, for so surely as that Odysseus ever was, there are now no longer any such masters in the house as he was, to receive honorable strangers or to further them on their way home. And now, you maids, wash his feet for him, and make him a bed on a couch with rugs and blankets, that he may be warm and quiet till morning. Then, at day break wash him and anoint him again, that he may sit in the room and take his meals with Telemakhos. It shall be the worse for any one of these hateful people who is uncivil to him; like it or not, he shall have no more to do in this house. For how, sir, shall you be able to learn whether or no I am superior to others of my sex both in goodness of heart and understanding  , if I let you dine in my cloisters squalid and ill clad? Men live but for a little season; if they are hard, and deal hardly, people wish them ill so long as they are alive, and speak contemptuously of them when they are dead, but he that is righteous and deals righteously, the people tell of his praise   among all lands, and many shall call him blessed."""	τὸν δʼ αὖτε προσέειπε περίφρων Πηνελόπεια· αἲ γὰρ τοῦτο, ξεῖνε, ἔπος τετελεσμένον εἴη· τῷ κε τάχα γνοίης φιλότητά τε πολλά τε δῶρα ἐξ ἐμεῦ, ὡς ἄν τίς σε συναντόμενος μακαρίζοι. ἀλλά μοι ὧδʼ ἀνὰ θυμὸν ὀΐεται, ὡς ἔσεταί περ· οὔτʼ Ὀδυσεὺς ἔτι οἶκον ἐλεύσεται, οὔτε σὺ πομπῆς τεύξῃ, ἐπεὶ οὐ τοῖοι σημάντορές εἰσʼ ἐνὶ οἴκῳ οἷος Ὀδυσσεὺς ἔσκε μετʼ ἀνδράσιν, εἴ ποτʼ ἔην γε, ξείνους αἰδοίους ἀποπεμπέμεν ἠδὲ δέχεσθαι. ἀλλά μιν, ἀμφίπολοι, ἀπονίψατε, κάτθετε δʼ εὐνήν, δέμνια καὶ χλαίνας καὶ ῥήγεα σιγαλόεντα, ὥς κʼ εὖ θαλπιόων χρυσόθρονον Ἠῶ ἵκηται. ἠῶθεν δὲ μάλʼ ἦρι λοέσσαι τε χρῖσαί τε, ὥς κʼ ἔνδον παρὰ Τηλεμάχῳ δείπνοιο μέδηται ἥμενος ἐν μεγάρῳ· τῷ δʼ ἄλγιον ὅς κεν ἐκείνων τοῦτον ἀνιάζῃ θυμοφθόρος· οὐδέ τι ἔργον ἐνθάδʼ ἔτι πρήξει, μάλα περ κεχολωμένος αἰνῶς. πῶς γὰρ ἐμεῦ σύ, ξεῖνε, δαήσεαι εἴ τι γυναικῶν ἀλλάων περίειμι νόον καὶ ἐπίφρονα μῆτιν, εἴ κεν ἀϋσταλέος, κακὰ εἱμένος ἐν μεγάροισιν δαινύῃ; ἄνθρωποι δὲ μινυνθάδιοι τελέθουσιν. ὃς μὲν ἀπηνὴς αὐτὸς ἔῃ καὶ ἀπηνέα εἰδῇ, τῷ δὲ καταρῶνται πάντες βροτοὶ ἄλγεʼ ὀπίσσω ζωῷ, ἀτὰρ τεθνεῶτί γʼ ἐφεψιόωνται ἅπαντες· ὃς δʼ ἂν ἀμύμων αὐτὸς ἔῃ καὶ ἀμύμονα εἰδῇ, τοῦ μέν τε κλέος εὐρὺ δὶα ξεῖνοι φορέουσι πάντας ἐπʼ ἀνθρώπους, πολλοί τέ μιν ἐσθλὸν ἔειπον.
"Odysseus answered, ""Lady, I have foresworn rugs and blankets from the day that I left the snowy ranges of Crete to go on shipboard. I will lie as I have lain on many a sleepless night hitherto. Night after night have I passed in any rough sleeping place, and waited for morning. Nor, again, do I like having my feet washed; I shall not let any of the young hussies about your house touch my feet; but, if you have any old and respectable woman who has gone through as much trouble as I have, I will allow her to wash them."""	τὴν δʼ ἀπαμειβόμενος προσέφη πολύμητις Ὀδυσσεύς· ὦ γύναι αἰδοίη Λαερτιάδεω Ὀδυσῆος, ἦ τοι ἐμοὶ χλαῖναι καὶ ῥήγεα σιγαλόεντα ἤχθεθʼ, ὅτε πρῶτον Κρήτης ὄρεα νιφόεντα νοσφισάμην ἐπὶ νηὸς ἰὼν δολιχηρέτμοιο, κείω δʼ ὡς τὸ πάρος περ ἀΰπνους νύκτας ἴαυον· πολλὰς γὰρ δὴ νύκτας ἀεικελίῳ ἐνὶ κοίτῃ ἄεσα καί τʼ ἀνέμεινα ἐΰθρονον Ἠῶ δῖαν. οὐδέ τί μοι ποδάνιπτρα ποδῶν ἐπιήρανα θυμῷ γίγνεται· οὐδὲ γυνὴ ποδὸς ἅψεται ἡμετέροιο τάων αἵ τοι δῶμα κάτα δρήστειραι ἔασιν, εἰ μή τις γρηῦς ἔστι παλαιή, κεδνὰ ἰδυῖα, ἥ τις δὴ τέτληκε τόσα φρεσὶν ὅσσα τʼ ἐγώ περ· τῇ δʼ οὐκ ἂν φθονέοιμι ποδῶν ἅψασθαι ἐμεῖο.
"To this Penelope said, ""My dear sir, of all the guests who ever yet came to my house there never was one who spoke in all things with such admirable propriety as you do. There happens to be in the house a most respectable old woman - the same who received my poor dear husband in her arms the night he was born, and nursed him in infancy. She is very feeble now, but she shall wash your feet. Come here,"" said she, ""Eurykleia, and wash your master's age-mate; I suppose Odysseus’ hands and feet are very much the same now as his are, for trouble ages all of us dreadfully fast."""	τὸν δʼ αὖτε προσέειπε περίφρων Πηνελόπεια· ξεῖνε φίλʼ· οὐ γάρ πώ τις ἀνὴρ πεπνυμένος ὧδε ξείνων τηλεδαπῶν φιλίων ἐμὸν ἵκετο δῶμα, ὡς σὺ μάλʼ εὐφραδέως πεπνυμένα πάντʼ ἀγορεύεις· ἔστι δέ μοι γρηῢς πυκινὰ φρεσὶ μήδεʼ ἔχουσα ἣ κεῖνον δύστηνον ἐῢ τρέφεν ἠδʼ ἀτίταλλε, δεξαμένη χείρεσσʼ, ὅτε μιν πρῶτον τέκε μήτηρ, ἥ σε πόδας νίψει, ὀλιγηπελέουσά περ ἔμπης. ἀλλʼ ἄγε νῦν ἀνστᾶσα, περίφρων Εὐρύκλεια, νίψον σοῖο ἄνακτος ὁμήλικα· καί που Ὀδυσσεὺς ἤδη τοιόσδʼ ἐστὶ πόδας τοιόσδε τε χεῖρας· αἶψα γὰρ ἐν κακότητι βροτοὶ καταγηράσκουσιν.
"On these words the old woman covered her face with her hands; she began to weep and made lamentation saying, ""My dear child, I cannot think whatever I am to do with you. I am certain no one was ever more god-fearing than yourself, and yet Zeus hates you. No one in the whole world ever burned him more thigh bones, nor gave him finer hecatombs when you prayed you might come to a green old age yourself and see your son grow up to take after you; yet see how he has prevented you alone from ever getting back to your own home. I have no doubt the women in some foreign palace which Odysseus has got to are gibing at him as all these sluts here have been gibing you. I do not wonder at your not choosing to let them wash you after the manner in which they have insulted you; I will wash your feet myself gladly enough, as Penelope has said that I am to do so; I will wash them both for Penelope's sake and for your own, for you have raised the most lively feelings of compassion in my mind; and let me say this moreover, which pray attend to; we have had all kinds of strangers in distress come here before now, but I make bold to say that no one ever yet came who was so like Odysseus in figure, voice, and feet as you are."""	ὣς ἄρʼ ἔφη, γρηῢς δὲ κατέσχετο χερσὶ πρόσωπα, δάκρυα δʼ ἔκβαλε θερμά, ἔπος δʼ ὀλοφυδνὸν ἔειπεν· ὤ μοι ἐγὼ σέο, τέκνον, ἀμήχανος· ἦ σε περὶ Ζεὺς ἀνθρώπων ἤχθηρε θεουδέα θυμὸν ἔχοντα. οὐ γάρ πώ τις τόσσα βροτῶν Διὶ τερπικεραύνῳ πίονα μηρίʼ ἔκηʼ οὐδʼ ἐξαίτους ἑκατόμβας, ὅσσα σὺ τῷ ἐδίδους, ἀρώμενος ἧος ἵκοιο γῆράς τε λιπαρὸν θρέψαιό τε φαίδιμον υἱόν· νῦν δέ τοι οἴῳ πάμπαν ἀφείλετο νόστιμον ἦμαρ. οὕτω που καὶ κείνῳ ἐφεψιόωντο γυναῖκες ξείνων τηλεδαπῶν, ὅτε τευ κλυτὰ δώμαθʼ ἵκοιτο, ὡς σέθεν αἱ κύνες αἵδε καθεψιόωνται ἅπασαι, τάων νῦν λώβην τε καὶ αἴσχεα πόλλʼ ἀλεείνων οὐκ ἐάας νίζειν· ἐμὲ δʼ οὐκ ἀέκουσαν ἄνωγε κούρη Ἰκαρίοιο, περίφρων Πηνελόπεια. τῷ σε πόδας νίψω ἅμα τʼ αὐτῆς Πηνελοπείης καὶ σέθεν εἵνεκʼ, ἐπεί μοι ὀρώρεται ἔνδοθι θυμὸς κήδεσιν. ἀλλʼ ἄγε νῦν ξυνίει ἔπος, ὅττι κεν εἴπω· πολλοὶ δὴ ξεῖνοι ταλαπείριοι ἐνθάδʼ ἵκοντο, ἀλλʼ οὔ πώ τινά φημι ἐοικότα ὧδε ἰδέσθαι ὡς σὺ δέμας φωνήν τε πόδας τʼ Ὀδυσῆϊ ἔοικας.
"""Those who have seen us both,"" answered Odysseus, ""have always said we were wonderfully like each other, and now you have noticed it too."	τὴν δʼ ἀπαμειβόμενος προσέφη πολύμητις Ὀδυσσεύς· ὦ γρηῦ, οὕτω φασὶν ὅσοι ἴδον ὀφθαλμοῖσιν ἡμέας ἀμφοτέρους, μάλα εἰκέλω ἀλλήλοιϊν ἔμμεναι, ὡς σύ περ αὐτὴ ἐπιφρονέουσʼ ἀγορεύεις.
"Then the old woman took the cauldron in which she was going to wash his feet, and poured plenty of cold water into it, adding hot till the bath was warm enough. Odysseus sat by the fire, but ere long he turned away from the light, for it occurred to him that when the old woman had hold of his leg she would recognize a certain scar which it bore, whereon the whole truth would come out. And indeed as soon as she began washing her master, she at once knew the scar as one that had been given him by a wild boar when he was hunting on Mount Parnassus with his excellent grandfather Autolykos - who was the most accomplished thief and perjurer in the whole world - and with the sons of Autolykos. Hermes himself had endowed him with this gift, for he used to burn the thigh bones of goats and kids to him, so he took pleasure in his companionship. It happened once that Autolykos had gone to the of Ithaca and had found the child of his daughter just born. As soon as he had done supper Eurykleia set the infant upon his knees and said, ""You must find a name for your grandson; you greatly wished that you might have one."""	ὣς ἄρʼ ἔφη, γρηῢς δὲ λέβηθʼ ἕλε παμφανόωντα τοῦ πόδας ἐξαπένιζεν, ὕδωρ δʼ ἐνεχεύατο πουλὺ ψυχρόν, ἔπειτα δὲ θερμὸν ἐπήφυσεν. αὐτὰρ Ὀδυσσεὺς ἷζεν ἐπʼ ἐσχαρόφιν, ποτὶ δὲ σκότον ἐτράπετʼ αἶψα· αὐτίκα γὰρ κατὰ θυμὸν ὀΐσατο, μή ἑ λαβοῦσα οὐλὴν ἀμφράσσαιτο καὶ ἀμφαδὰ ἔργα γένοιτο. νίζε δʼ ἄρʼ ἆσσον ἰοῦσα ἄναχθʼ ἑόν· αὐτίκα δʼ ἔγνω οὐλήν, τήν ποτέ μιν σῦς ἤλασε λευκῷ ὀδόντι Παρνησόνδʼ ἐλθόντα μετʼ Αὐτόλυκόν τε καὶ υἷας, μητρὸς ἑῆς πάτερʼ ἐσθλόν, ὃς ἀνθρώπους ἐκέκαστο κλεπτοσύνῃ θʼ ὅρκῳ τε· θεὸς δέ οἱ αὐτὸς ἔδωκεν Ἑρμείας· τῷ γὰρ κεχαρισμένα μηρία καῖεν ἀρνῶν ἠδʼ ἐρίφων· ὁ δέ οἱ πρόφρων ἅμʼ ὀπήδει.

"‘Son-in-law and daughter,"" replied Autolykos, ""call the child thus: I am highly displeased with a large number of people in one place and another, both men and women; so name the child ‘Odysseus,’ or the child of anger. When he grows up and comes to visit his mother's family on Mount Parnassus , where my possessions lie, I will make him a present and will send him on his way rejoicing."""	γαμβρὸς ἐμὸς θυγάτηρ τε, τίθεσθʼ ὄνομʼ ὅττι κεν εἴπω· πολλοῖσιν γὰρ ἐγώ γε ὀδυσσάμενος τόδʼ ἱκάνω, ἀνδράσιν ἠδὲ γυναιξὶν ἀνὰ χθόνα πουλυβότειραν· τῷ δʼ Ὀδυσεὺς ὄνομʼ ἔστω ἐπώνυμον· αὐτὰρ ἐγώ γε, ὁππότʼ ἂν ἡβήσας μητρώϊον ἐς μέγα δῶμα ἔλθῃ Παρνησόνδʼ, ὅθι πού μοι κτήματʼ ἔασι, τῶν οἱ ἐγὼ δώσω καί μιν χαίροντʼ ἀποπέμψω.
Odysseus, therefore, went to Parnassus to get the presents from Autolykos, who with his sons shook hands with him and gave him welcome. His grandmother Amphithea threw her arms about him, and kissed his head, and both his beautiful eyes, while Autolykos desired his sons to get dinner ready, and they did as he told them. They brought in a five year old bull, flayed it, made it ready and divided it into joints; these they then cut carefully up into smaller pieces and spitted them; they roasted them sufficiently and served the portions round. Thus through the livelong day to the going down of the sun they feasted, and every man had his full share so that all were satisfied; but when the sun set and it came on dark, they went to bed and enjoyed the boon of sleep.	τῶν ἕνεκʼ ἦλθʼ Ὀδυσεύς, ἵνα οἱ πόροι ἀγλαὰ δῶρα. τὸν μὲν ἄρʼ Αὐτόλυκός τε καὶ υἱέες Αὐτολύκοιο χερσίν τʼ ἠσπάζοντο ἔπεσσί τε μειλιχίοισι· μήτηρ δʼ Ἀμφιθέη μητρὸς περιφῦσʼ Ὀδυσῆϊ κύσσʼ ἄρα μιν κεφαλήν τε καὶ ἄμφω φάεα καλά.

When the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared, the sons of Autolykos went out with their hounds hunting, and Odysseus went too. They climbed the wooded slopes of Parnassus and soon reached its breezy upland valleys; but as the sun was beginning to beat upon the fields, fresh-risen from the slow still currents of Okeanos, they came to a mountain dell. The dogs were in front searching for the tracks of the beast they were chasing, and after them came the sons of Autolykos, among whom was Odysseus, close behind the dogs, and he had a long spear in his hand. Here was the lair of a huge boar among some thick brushwood, so dense that the wind and rain could not get through it, nor could the sun's rays pierce it, and the ground underneath lay thick with fallen leaves. The boar heard the noise of the men's feet, and the hounds baying on every side as the huntsmen came up to him, so rushed from his lair, raised the bristles on his neck, and stood at bay with fire flashing from his eyes. Odysseus was the first to raise his spear and try to drive it into the brute, but the boar was too quick for him, and charged him sideways, ripping him above the knee with a gash that tore deep though it did not reach the bone. As for the boar, Odysseus hit him on the right shoulder, and the point of the spear went right through him, so that he fell groaning in the dust until the life went out of him. The sons of Autolykos busied themselves with the carcass of the boar, and bound Odysseus’ wound; then, after saying a spell to stop the bleeding, they went home as fast as they could. But when Autolykos and his sons had thoroughly healed Odysseus, they made him some splendid presents, and sent him back to Ithaca with much mutual good will. When he got back, his father and mother were rejoiced to see him, and asked him all about it, and how he had hurt himself to get the scar; so he told them how the boar had ripped him when he was out hunting with Autolykos and his sons on Mount Parnassus.	ἦμος δʼ ἠέλιος κατέδυ καὶ ἐπὶ κνέφας ἦλθεν, δὴ τότε κοιμήσαντο καὶ ὕπνου δῶρον ἕλοντο. ἦμος δʼ ἠριγένεια φάνη ῥοδοδάκτυλος Ἠώς, βάν ῥʼ ἴμεν ἐς θήρην, ἠμὲν κύνες ἠδὲ καὶ αὐτοὶ υἱέες Αὐτολύκου· μετὰ τοῖσι δὲ δῖος Ὀδυσσεὺς ἤϊεν· αἰπὺ δʼ ὄρος προσέβαν καταειμένον ὕλῃ Παρνησοῦ, τάχα δʼ ἵκανον πτύχας ἠνεμοέσσας.

"As soon as Eurykleia had got the scarred limb in her hands and had well hold of it, she recognized it and dropped the foot at once. The leg fell into the bath, which rang out and was overturned, so that all the water was spilt on the ground; Eurykleia's eyes between her joy and her grief filled with tears, and she could not speak, but she caught Odysseus by the beard and said, ""My dear child, I am sure you must be Odysseus himself, only I did not know you till I had actually touched and handled you."""	τὴν γρηῢς χείρεσσι καταπρηνέσσι λαβοῦσα γνῶ ῥʼ ἐπιμασσαμένη, πόδα δὲ προέηκε φέρεσθαι· ἐν δὲ λέβητι πέσε κνήμη, κανάχησε δὲ χαλκός, ἂψ δʼ ἑτέρωσʼ ἐκλίθη· τὸ δʼ ἐπὶ χθονὸς ἐξέχυθʼ ὕδωρ. τὴν δʼ ἅμα χάρμα καὶ ἄλγος ἕλε φρένα, τὼ δέ οἱ ὄσσε δακρυόφι πλῆσθεν, θαλερὴ δέ οἱ ἔσχετο φωνή. ἁψαμένη δὲ γενείου Ὀδυσσῆα προσέειπεν· ἦ μάλʼ Ὀδυσσεύς ἐσσι, φίλον τέκος· οὐδέ σʼ ἐγώ γε πρὶν ἔγνων, πρὶν πάντα ἄνακτʼ ἐμὸν ἀμφαφάασθαι.
"As she spoke she looked towards Penelope, as though wanting to tell her that her dear husband was in the house, but Penelope was unable to look in that direction and observe what was going on, for Athena had diverted her attention  ; so Odysseus caught Eurykleia by the throat with his right hand and with his left drew her close to him, and said, ""Nurse, do you wish to be the ruin of me, you who nursed me at your own breast, now that after twenty years of wandering I am at last come to my own home again? Since it has been borne in upon you by heaven to recognize me, hold your tongue, and do not say a word about it any one else in the house, for if you do I tell you - and it shall surely be - that if heaven grants me to take the lives of these suitors, I will not spare you, though you are my own nurse, when I am killing the other women."""	ἦ καὶ Πηνελόπειαν ἐσέδρακεν ὀφθαλμοῖσι, πεφραδέειν ἐθέλουσα φίλον πόσιν ἔνδον ἐόντα. ἡ δʼ οὔτʼ ἀθρῆσαι δύνατʼ ἀντίη οὔτε νοῆσαι· τῇ γὰρ Ἀθηναίη νόον ἔτραπεν· αὐτὰρ Ὀδυσσεὺς χεῖρʼ ἐπιμασσάμενος φάρυγος λάβε δεξιτερῆφι, τῇ δʼ ἑτέρῃ ἕθεν ἆσσον ἐρύσσατο φώνησέν τε. μαῖα, τίη μʼ ἐθέλεις ὀλέσαι; σὺ δέ μʼ ἔτρεφες αὐτὴ τῷ σῷ ἐπὶ μαζῷ· νῦν δʼ ἄλγεα πολλὰ μογήσας ἤλυθον εἰκοστῷ ἔτεϊ ἐς πατρίδα γαῖαν. ἀλλʼ ἐπεὶ ἐφράσθης καί τοι θεὸς ἔμβαλε θυμῷ, σίγα, μή τίς τʼ ἄλλος ἐνὶ μεγάροισι πύθηται. ὧδε γὰρ ἐξερέω, καὶ μὴν τετελεσμένον ἔσται· εἴ χʼ ὑπʼ ἐμοί γε θεὸς δαμάσῃ μνηστῆρας ἀγαυούς, οὐδὲ τροφοῦ οὔσης σεῦ ἀφέξομαι, ὁππότʼ ἂν ἄλλας δμῳὰς ἐν μεγάροισιν ἐμοῖς κτείνωμι γυναῖκας.
"""My child,"" answered Eurykleia, ""what are you talking about? You know very well that nothing can either bend or break me. I will hold my tongue like a stone or a piece of iron; furthermore let me say, and lay my saying to your heart, when heaven has delivered the suitors into your hand, I will give you a list of the women in the house who have been ill-behaved, and of those who are guiltless."""	τὸν δʼ αὖτε προσέειπε περίφρων Εὐρύκλεια· τέκνον ἐμόν, ποῖόν σε ἔπος φύγεν ἕρκος ὀδόντων. οἶσθα μὲν οἷον ἐμὸν μένος ἔμπεδον οὐδʼ ἐπιεικτόν, ἕξω δʼ ὡς ὅτε τις στερεὴ λίθος ἠὲ σίδηρος. ἄλλο δέ τοι ἐρέω, σὺ δʼ ἐνὶ φρεσὶ βάλλεο σῇσιν· εἴ χʼ ὑπό σοι γε θεὸς δαμάσῃ μνηστῆρας ἀγαυούς, δὴ τότε τοι καταλέξω ἐνὶ μεγάροισι γυναῖκας, αἵ τέ σʼ ἀτιμάζουσι καὶ αἳ νηλείτιδές εἰσι.
"And Odysseus answered, ""Nurse, you ought not to speak in that way; I am well able to form my own opinion about one and all of them; hold your tongue and leave everything to heaven."""	τὴν δʼ ἀπαμειβόμενος προσέφη πολύμητις Ὀδυσσεύς μαῖα, τίη δὲ σὺ τὰς μυθήσεαι; οὐδέ τί σε χρή. εὖ νυ καὶ αὐτὸς ἐγὼ φράσομαι καὶ εἴσομʼ ἑκάστην· ἀλλʼ ἔχε σιγῇ μῦθον, ἐπίτρεψον δὲ θεοῖσιν.
As he said this Eurykleia left the room to fetch some more water, for the first had been all spilt; and when she had washed him and anointed him with oil, Odysseus drew his seat nearer to the fire to warm himself, and hid the scar under his rags. Then Penelope began talking to him and said:	ὣς ἄρʼ ἔφη, γρηῢς δὲ διὲκ μεγάροιο βεβήκει οἰσομένη ποδάνιπτρα· τὰ γὰρ πρότερʼ ἔκχυτο πάντα. αὐτὰρ ἐπεὶ νίψεν τε καὶ ἤλειψεν λίπʼ ἐλαίῳ, αὖτις ἄρʼ ἀσσοτέρω πυρὸς ἕλκετο δίφρον Ὀδυσσεὺς θερσόμενος, οὐλὴν δὲ κατὰ ῥακέεσσι κάλυψε. τοῖσι δὲ μύθων ἦρχε περίφρων Πηνελόπεια·
"""Stranger, I should like to speak with you briefly about another matter. It is indeed nearly bed time - for those, at least, who can sleep in spite of sorrow. As for myself, a has given me a life of such unmeasurable woe  , that even by day when I am attending to my duties and looking after the servants, I am still weeping and lamenting during the whole time; then, when night comes, and we all of us go to bed, I lie awake thinking, and my heart becomes prey to the most incessant and cruel tortures. As the dun nightingale, daughter of Pandareus, sings in the early spring from her seat in shadiest covert hid, and with many a plaintive trill pours out the tale how by mishap she killed her own child Itylos, son of king Zethos, even so does my mind toss and turn in its uncertainty whether I ought to stay with my son here, and safeguard my substance, my bondsmen, and the greatness of my house, out of regard to the opinion of the and the memory of my late husband, or whether it is not now time for me to go with the best of these suitors who are wooing me and making me such magnificent presents. As long as my son was still young, and unable to understand, he would not hear of my leaving my husband's house, but now that he is full grown he begs and prays me to do so, being incensed at the way in which the suitors are eating up his property. Listen, then, to a dream that I have had and interpret it for me if you can. I have twenty geese about the house that eat mash out of a trough, and of which I am exceedingly fond. I dreamed that a great eagle came swooping down from a mountain, and dug his curved beak into the neck of each of them till he had killed them all. Presently he soared off into the sky, and left them lying dead about the yard; whereon I wept in my room till all my maids gathered round me, so piteously was I grieving because the eagle had killed my geese. Then he came back again, and perching on a projecting rafter spoke to me with human voice, and told me to leave off crying. ‘Be of good courage,’ he said, ‘daughter of Ikarios; this is no dream, but a vision of good omen that shall surely come to pass. The geese are the suitors, and I am no longer an eagle, but your own husband, who am come back to you, and who will bring these suitors to a disgraceful end.’ On this I woke, and when I looked out I saw my geese at the trough eating their mash as usual."""	ξεῖνε, τὸ μέν σʼ ἔτι τυτθὸν ἐγὼν εἰρήσομαι αὐτή· καὶ γὰρ δὴ κοίτοιο τάχʼ ἔσσεται ἡδέος ὥρη, ὅν τινά γʼ ὕπνος ἕλοι γλυκερός, καὶ κηδόμενόν περ. αὐτὰρ ἐμοὶ καὶ πένθος ἀμέτρητον πόρε δαίμων· ἤματα μὲν γὰρ τέρπομʼ ὀδυρομένη, γοόωσα, ἔς τʼ ἐμὰ ἔργʼ ὁρόωσα καὶ ἀμφιπόλων ἐνὶ οἴκῳ· αὐτὰρ ἐπὴν νὺξ ἔλθῃ, ἕλῃσί τε κοῖτος ἅπαντας, κεῖμαι ἐνὶ λέκτρῳ, πυκιναὶ δέ μοι ἀμφʼ ἀδινὸν κῆρ ὀξεῖαι μελεδῶνες ὀδυρομένην ἐρέθουσιν. ὡς δʼ ὅτε Πανδαρέου κούρη, χλωρηῒς ἀηδών, καλὸν ἀείδῃσιν ἔαρος νέον ἱσταμένοιο, δενδρέων ἐν πετάλοισι καθεζομένη πυκινοῖσιν, ἥ τε θαμὰ τρωπῶσα χέει πολυηχέα φωνήν, παῖδʼ ὀλοφυρομένη Ἴτυλον φίλον, ὅν ποτε χαλκῷ κτεῖνε διʼ ἀφραδίας, κοῦρον Ζήθοιο ἄνακτος, ὣς καὶ ἐμοὶ δίχα θυμὸς ὀρώρεται ἔνθα καὶ ἔνθα, ἠὲ μένω παρὰ παιδὶ καὶ ἔμπεδα πάντα φυλάσσω, κτῆσιν ἐμήν, δμῶάς τε καὶ ὑψερεφὲς μέγα δῶμα, εὐνήν τʼ αἰδομένη πόσιος δήμοιό τε φῆμιν, ἦ ἤδη ἅμʼ ἕπωμαι Ἀχαιῶν ὅς τις ἄριστος μνᾶται ἐνὶ μεγάροισι, πορὼν ἀπερείσια ἕδνα. παῖς δʼ ἐμὸς ἧος ἔην ἔτι νήπιος ἠδὲ χαλίφρων, γήμασθʼ οὔ μʼ εἴα πόσιος κατὰ δῶμα λιποῦσαν· νῦν δʼ ὅτε δὴ μέγας ἐστὶ καὶ ἥβης μέτρον ἱκάνει, καὶ δή μʼ ἀρᾶται πάλιν ἐλθέμεν ἐκ μεγάροιο, κτήσιος ἀσχαλόων, τήν οἱ κατέδουσιν Ἀχαιοί. ἀλλʼ ἄγε μοι τὸν ὄνειρον ὑπόκριναι καὶ ἄκουσον. χῆνές μοι κατὰ οἶκον ἐείκοσι πυρὸν ἔδουσιν ἐξ ὕδατος, καί τέ σφιν ἰαίνομαι εἰσορόωσα· ἐλθὼν δʼ ἐξ ὄρεος μέγας αἰετὸς ἀγκυλοχείλης πᾶσι κατʼ αὐχένας ἦξε καὶ ἔκτανεν· οἱ δʼ ἐκέχυντο ἀθρόοι ἐν μεγάροις, ὁ δʼ ἐς αἰθέρα δῖαν ἀέρθη. αὐτὰρ ἐγὼ κλαῖον καὶ ἐκώκυον ἔν περ ὀνείρῳ, ἀμφὶ δʼ ἔμʼ ἠγερέθοντο ἐϋπλοκαμῖδες Ἀχαιαί, οἴκτρʼ ὀλοφυρομένην ὅ μοι αἰετὸς ἔκτανε χῆνας. ἂψ δʼ ἐλθὼν κατʼ ἄρʼ ἕζετʼ ἐπὶ προὔχοντι μελάθρῳ, φωνῇ δὲ βροτέῃ κατερήτυε φώνησέν τε· θάρσει, Ἰκαρίου κούρη τηλεκλειτοῖο· οὐκ ὄναρ, ἀλλʼ ὕπαρ ἐσθλόν, ὅ τοι τετελεσμένον ἔσται. χῆνες μὲν μνηστῆρες, ἐγὼ δέ τοι αἰετὸς ὄρνις ἦα πάρος, νῦν αὖτε τεὸς πόσις εἰλήλουθα, ὃς πᾶσι μνηστῆρσιν ἀεικέα πότμον ἐφήσω. ὣς ἔφατʼ, αὐτὰρ ἐμὲ μελιηδὴς ὕπνος ἀνῆκε· παπτήνασα δὲ χῆνας ἐνὶ μεγάροισι νόησα πυρὸν ἐρεπτομένους παρὰ πύελον, ἧχι πάρος περ.
"""This dream, lady,"" replied Odysseus, ""can admit but of one interpretation, for had not Odysseus himself told you how it shall be fulfilled? The death of the suitors is portended, and not one single one of them will escape."""	τὴν δʼ ἀπαμειβόμενος προσέφη πολύμητις Ὀδυσσεύς· ὦ γύναι, οὔ πως ἔστιν ὑποκρίνασθαι ὄνειρον ἄλλῃ ἀποκλίναντʼ, ἐπεὶ ἦ ῥά τοι αὐτὸς Ὀδυσσεὺς πέφραδʼ ὅπως τελέει· μνηστῆρσι δὲ φαίνετʼ ὄλεθρος πᾶσι μάλʼ, οὐδέ κέ τις θάνατον καὶ κῆρας ἀλύξει.
"And Penelope answered, ""Stranger, dreams are very curious and unaccountable things, and they do not by any means invariably come true. There are two gates through which these insubstantial fancies proceed; the one is of horn, and the other ivory. Those that come through the gate of ivory are fatuous, but those from the gate of horn mean something to those that see them. I do not think, however, that my own dream came through the gate of horn, though I and my son should be most thankful if it proves to have done so. Furthermore I say - and lay my saying to your heart - the coming dawn will usher in the ill-omened day that is to sever me from the house of Odysseus, for I am about to hold a tournament   of axes. My husband used to set up twelve axes in the court, one in front of the other, like the stays upon which a ship is built; he would then go back from them and shoot an arrow through the whole twelve. I shall make the suitors try to perform the same feat  , and whichever of them can string the bow most easily, and send his arrow through all the twelve axes, him will I follow, and quit this house of my lawful husband, so goodly and so abounding in wealth. But even so, I doubt not that I shall remember it in my dreams."""	τὸν δʼ αὖτε προσέειπε περίφρων Πηνελόπεια· ξεῖνʼ, ἦ τοι μὲν ὄνειροι ἀμήχανοι ἀκριτόμυθοι γίγνοντʼ, οὐδέ τι πάντα τελείεται ἀνθρώποισι. δοιαὶ γάρ τε πύλαι ἀμενηνῶν εἰσὶν ὀνείρων· αἱ μὲν γὰρ κεράεσσι τετεύχαται, αἱ δʼ ἐλέφαντι· τῶν οἳ μέν κʼ ἔλθωσι διὰ πριστοῦ ἐλέφαντος, οἵ ῥʼ ἐλεφαίρονται, ἔπεʼ ἀκράαντα φέροντες· οἱ δὲ διὰ ξεστῶν κεράων ἔλθωσι θύραζε, οἵ ῥʼ ἔτυμα κραίνουσι, βροτῶν ὅτε κέν τις ἴδηται. ἀλλʼ ἐμοὶ οὐκ ἐντεῦθεν ὀΐομαι αἰνὸν ὄνειρον ἐλθέμεν· ἦ κʼ ἀσπαστὸν ἐμοὶ καὶ παιδὶ γένοιτο. ἄλλο δέ τοι ἐρέω, σὺ δʼ ἐνὶ φρεσὶ βάλλεο σῇσιν· ἥδε δὴ ἠὼς εἶσι δυσώνυμος, ἥ μʼ Ὀδυσῆος οἴκου ἀποσχήσει· νῦν γὰρ καταθήσω ἄεθλον, τοὺς πελέκεας, τοὺς κεῖνος ἐνὶ μεγάροισιν ἑοῖσιν ἵστασχʼ ἑξείης, δρυόχους ὥς, δώδεκα πάντας· στὰς δʼ ὅ γε πολλὸν ἄνευθε διαρρίπτασκεν ὀϊστόν. νῦν δὲ μνηστήρεσσιν ἄεθλον τοῦτον ἐφήσω· ὃς δέ κε ῥηΐτατʼ ἐντανύσῃ βιὸν ἐν παλάμῃσι καὶ διοϊστεύσῃ πελέκεων δυοκαίδεκα πάντων, τῷ κεν ἅμʼ ἑσποίμην, νοσφισσαμένη τόδε δῶμα κουρίδιον, μάλα καλόν, ἐνίπλειον βιότοιο· τοῦ ποτὲ μεμνήσεσθαι ὀΐομαι ἔν περ ὀνείρῳ.
"Then Odysseus answered, ""my lady wife of Odysseus, you need not defer your tournament  , for Odysseus will return ere ever they can string the bow, handle it how they will, and send their arrows through the iron."""	τὴν δʼ ἀπαμειβόμενος προσέφη πολύμητις Ὀδυσσεύς ὦ γύναι αἰδοίη Λαερτιάδεω Ὀδυσῆος, μηκέτι νῦν ἀνάβαλλε δόμοις ἔνι τοῦτον ἄεθλον· πρὶν γάρ τοι πολύμητις ἐλεύσεται ἐνθάδʼ Ὀδυσσεύς, πρὶν τούτους τόδε τόξον ἐΰξοον ἀμφαφόωντας νευρήν τʼ ἐντανύσαι διοϊστεῦσαί τε σιδήρου.
"To this Penelope said, ""As long, sir, as you will sit here and talk to me, I can have no desire to go to bed. Still, people cannot do permanently without sleep, and heaven has appointed us dwellers on earth a time for all things. I will therefore go upstairs and recline upon that couch which I have never ceased to flood with my tears from the day Odysseus set out for the city with a hateful name."""	τὸν δʼ αὖτε προσέειπε περίφρων Πηνελόπεια· εἴ κʼ ἐθέλοις μοι, ξεῖνε, παρήμενος ἐν μεγάροισι τέρπειν, οὔ κέ μοι ὕπνος ἐπὶ βλεφάροισι χυθείη. ἀλλʼ οὐ γάρ πως ἔστιν ἀΰπνους ἔμμεναι αἰεὶ ἀνθρώπους· ἐπὶ γάρ τοι ἑκάστῳ μοῖραν ἔθηκαν ἀθάνατοι θνητοῖσιν ἐπὶ ζείδωρον ἄρουραν. ἀλλʼ ἦ τοι μὲν ἐγὼν ὑπερώϊον εἰσαναβᾶσα λέξομαι εἰς εὐνήν, ἥ μοι στονόεσσα τέτυκται, αἰεὶ δάκρυσʼ ἐμοῖσι πεφυρμένη, ἐξ οὗ Ὀδυσσεὺς ᾤχετʼ ἐποψόμενος Κακοΐλιον οὐκ ὀνομαστήν. ἔνθα κε λεξαίμην· σὺ δὲ λέξεο τῷδʼ ἐνὶ οἴκῳ, ἢ χαμάδις στορέσας ἤ τοι κατὰ δέμνια θέντων.
She then went upstairs to her own room, not alone, but attended by her maidens, and when there, she lamented her dear husband till Athena shed sweet sleep over her eyelids.	ὣς εἰποῦσʼ ἀνέβαινʼ ὑπερώϊα σιγαλόεντα, οὐκ οἴη, ἅμα τῇ γε καὶ ἀμφίπολοι κίον ἄλλαι. ἐς δʼ ὑπερῷʼ ἀναβᾶσα σὺν ἀμφιπόλοισι γυναιξὶ κλαῖεν ἔπειτʼ Ὀδυσῆα, φίλον πόσιν, ὄφρα οἱ ὕπνον
"Odysseus slept in the room upon an undressed bullock's hide, on the top of which he threw several skins of the sheep the suitors had eaten, and Eurynome threw a cloak over him after he had laid himself down. There, then, Odysseus lay wakefully brooding upon the way in which he should kill the suitors; and by and by, the women who had been in the habit of misconducting themselves with them, left the house giggling and laughing with one another. This made Odysseus very angry, and he doubted whether to get up and kill every single one of them then and there, or to let them sleep one more and last time with the suitors. His heart growled within him, and as a bitch with puppies growls and shows her teeth when she sees a stranger, so did his heart growl with anger at the evil deeds that were being done: but he beat his breast and said, ""Heart, be still, you had worse than this to bear on the day when the terrible Cyclops ate your brave companions; yet you bore it in silence till your cunning got you safe out of the cave, though you made sure of being killed."""	αὐτὰρ ὁ ἐν προδόμῳ εὐνάζετο δῖος Ὀδυσσεύς· κὰμ μὲν ἀδέψητον βοέην στόρεσʼ, αὐτὰρ ὕπερθε κώεα πόλλʼ ὀΐων, τοὺς ἱρεύεσκον Ἀχαιοί· Εὐρυνόμη δʼ ἄρʼ ἐπὶ χλαῖναν βάλε κοιμηθέντι. ἔνθʼ Ὀδυσεὺς μνηστῆρσι κακὰ φρονέων ἐνὶ θυμῷ κεῖτʼ ἐγρηγορόων· ταὶ δʼ ἐκ μεγάροιο γυναῖκες ἤϊσαν, αἳ μνηστῆρσιν ἐμισγέσκοντο πάρος περ, ἀλλήλῃσι γέλω τε καὶ εὐφροσύνην παρέχουσαι. τοῦ δʼ ὠρίνετο θυμὸς ἐνὶ στήθεσσι φίλοισι· πολλὰ δὲ μερμήριζε κατὰ φρένα καὶ κατὰ θυμόν, ἠὲ μεταΐξας θάνατον τεύξειεν ἑκάστῃ, ἦ ἔτʼ ἐῷ μνηστῆρσιν ὑπερφιάλοισι μιγῆναι ὕστατα καὶ πύματα, κραδίη δέ οἱ ἔνδον ὑλάκτει. ὡς δὲ κύων ἀμαλῇσι περὶ σκυλάκεσσι βεβῶσα ἄνδρʼ ἀγνοιήσασʼ ὑλάει μέμονέν τε μάχεσθαι, ὥς ῥα τοῦ ἔνδον ὑλάκτει ἀγαιομένου κακὰ ἔργα· στῆθος δὲ πλήξας κραδίην ἠνίπαπε μύθῳ· τέτλαθι δή, κραδίη· καὶ κύντερον ἄλλο ποτʼ ἔτλης. ἤματι τῷ ὅτε μοι μένος ἄσχετος ἤσθιε Κύκλωψ ἰφθίμους ἑτάρους· σὺ δʼ ἐτόλμας, ὄφρα σε μῆτις ἐξάγαγʼ ἐξ ἄντροιο ὀϊόμενον θανέεσθαι.
"Thus he chided with his heart, and checked it into endurance, but he tossed about as one who turns a paunch full of blood and fat in front of a hot fire, doing it first on one side and then on the other, that he may get it cooked as soon as possible, even so did he turn himself about from side to side, thinking all the time how, single handed as he was, he should contrive to kill so large a body of men as the wicked suitors. But by and by Athena came down from heaven in the likeness of a woman, and hovered over his head saying, ""My poor unhappy man, why do you lie awake in this way? This is your house: your wife is safe inside it, and so is your son who is just such a young man as any father may be proud of."""	ὣς ἔφατʼ, ἐν στήθεσσι καθαπτόμενος φίλον ἦτορ· τῷ δὲ μάλʼ ἐν πείσῃ κραδίη μένε τετληυῖα νωλεμέως· ἀτὰρ αὐτὸς ἑλίσσετο ἔνθα καὶ ἔνθα. ὡς δʼ ὅτε γαστέρʼ ἀνὴρ πολέος πυρὸς αἰθομένοιο, ἐμπλείην κνίσης τε καὶ αἵματος, ἔνθα καὶ ἔνθα αἰόλλῃ, μάλα δʼ ὦκα λιλαίεται ὀπτηθῆναι, ὣς ἄρʼ ὅ γʼ ἔνθα καὶ ἔνθα ἑλίσσετο, μερμηρίζων ὅππως δὴ μνηστῆρσιν ἀναιδέσι χεῖρας ἐφήσει μοῦνος ἐὼν πολέσι. σχεδόθεν δέ οἱ ἦλθεν Ἀθήνη οὐρανόθεν καταβᾶσα· δέμας δʼ ἤϊκτο γυναικί· στῆ δʼ ἄρʼ ὑπὲρ κεφαλῆς καί μιν πρὸς μῦθον ἔειπε· τίπτʼ αὖτʼ ἐγρήσσεις, πάντων περὶ κάμμορε φωτῶν; οἶκος μέν τοι ὅδʼ ἐστί, γυνὴ δέ τοι ἥδʼ ἐνὶ οἴκῳ καὶ, πάϊς, οἷόν πού τις ἐέλδεται ἔμμεναι υἷα.
"""Goddess,"" answered Odysseus, ""all that you have said is true, but I am in some doubt as to how I shall be able to kill these wicked suitors single handed, seeing what a number of them there always are. And there is this further difficulty, which is still more considerable. Supposing that with Zeus’ and your assistance I succeed in killing them, I must ask you to consider where I am to escape to from their avengers when it is all over."""	τὴν δʼ ἀπαμειβόμενος προσέφη πολύμητις Ὀδυσσεύς· ναὶ δὴ ταῦτά γε πάντα, θεά, κατὰ μοῖραν ἔειπες· ἀλλά τί μοι τόδε θυμὸς ἐνὶ φρεσὶ μερμηρίζει, ὅππως δὴ μνηστῆρσιν ἀναιδέσι χεῖρας ἐφήσω, μοῦνος ἐών· οἱ δʼ αἰὲν ἀολλέες ἔνδον ἔασι. πρὸς δʼ ἔτι καὶ τόδε μεῖζον ἐνὶ φρεσὶ μερμηρίζω· εἴ περ γὰρ κτείναιμι Διός τε σέθεν τε ἕκητι, πῆ κεν ὑπεκπροφύγοιμι; τά σε φράζεσθαι ἄνωγα.
"""For shame,"" replied Athena, ""why, any one else would trust a worse ally than myself, even though that ally were only a mortal and less wise than I am. Am I not a goddess, and have I not protected you throughout in all your ordeals  ? I tell you plainly that even though there were fifty bands of men surrounding us and eager to kill us, you should take all their sheep and cattle, and drive them away with you. But go to sleep; it is a very bad thing to lie awake all night, and you shall be out of your troubles before long."""	τὸν δʼ αὖτε προσέειπε θεὰ γλαυκῶπις Ἀθήνη· σχέτλιε, καὶ μέν τίς τε χερείονι πείθεθʼ ἑταίρῳ, ὅς περ θνητός τʼ ἐστὶ καὶ οὐ τόσα μήδεα οἶδεν· αὐτὰρ ἐγὼ θεός εἰμι, διαμπερὲς ἥ σε φυλάσσω ἐν πάντεσσι πόνοις. ἐρέω δέ τοι ἐξαναφανδόν· εἴ περ πεντήκοντα λόχοι μερόπων ἀνθρώπων νῶϊ περισταῖεν, κτεῖναι μεμαῶτες Ἄρηϊ, καί κεν τῶν ἐλάσαιο βόας καὶ ἴφια μῆλα. ἀλλʼ ἑλέτω σε καὶ ὕπνος· ἀνίη καὶ τὸ φυλάσσειν πάννυχον ἐγρήσσοντα, κακῶν δʼ ὑποδύσεαι ἤδη.
As she spoke she shed sleep over his eyes, and then went back to Olympus .	ὣς φάτο, καί ῥά οἱ ὕπνον ἐπὶ βλεφάροισιν ἔχευεν, αὐτὴ δʼ ἂψ ἐς Ὄλυμπον ἀφίκετο δῖα θεάων.
"While Odysseus was thus yielding himself to a very deep slumber that eased the burden of his sorrows, his admirable wife awoke, and sitting up in her bed began to cry. When she had relieved herself by weeping she prayed to Artemis saying, ""Great Goddess Artemis, daughter of Zeus, drive an arrow into my heart and slay me; or let some whirlwind snatch me up and bear me through paths of darkness till it drop me into the mouths of overflowing Okeanos, as it did the daughters of Pandareus. The daughters of Pandareus lost their father and mother, for the gods killed them, so they were left orphans. But Aphrodite took care of them, and fed them on cheese, honey, and sweet wine. Hera taught them to excel all women in beauty of form and understanding; Artemis gave them an imposing presence, and Athena endowed them with every kind of accomplishment; but one day when Aphrodite had gone up to Olympus to see Zeus about getting them married (for well does he know both what shall happen and what not happen to every one) the storm winds came and spirited them away to become handmaids to the dread Erinyes. Even so I wish that the gods who live in heaven would hide me from mortal sight, or that fair Artemis might strike me, for I would fain go even beneath the sad earth if I might do so still looking towards Odysseus only, and without having to yield myself to a worse man than he was. Besides, no matter how many people may grieve by day, they can put up with it so long as they can sleep at night, for when the eyes are closed in slumber people forget good and ill alike; whereas my miserable haunts me even in my dreams. This very night I thought there was one lying by my side who was like Odysseus as he was when he went away with his host, and I rejoiced, for I believed that it was no dream, but the very truth itself."""	εὖτε τὸν ὕπνος ἔμαρπτε, λύων μελεδήματα θυμοῦ, λυσιμελής, ἄλοχος δʼ ἄρʼ ἐπέγρετο κεδνὰ ἰδυῖα· κλαῖε δʼ ἄρʼ ἐν λέκτροισι καθεζομένη μαλακοῖσιν. αὐτὰρ ἐπεὶ κλαίουσα κορέσσατο ὃν κατὰ θυμόν, Ἀρτέμιδι πρώτιστον ἐπεύξατο δῖα γυναικῶν· Ἄρτεμι, πότνα θεά, θύγατερ Διός, αἴθε μοι ἤδη ἰὸν ἐνὶ στήθεσσι βαλοῦσʼ ἐκ θυμὸν ἕλοιο αὐτίκα νῦν, ἢ ἔπειτα μʼ ἀναρπάξασα θύελλα οἴχοιτο προφέρουσα κατʼ ἠερόεντα κέλευθα, ἐν προχοῇς δὲ βάλοι ἀψορρόου Ὠκεανοῖο. ὡς δʼ ὅτε Πανδαρέου κούρας ἀνέλοντο θύελλαι· τῇσι τοκῆας μὲν φθῖσαν θεοί, αἱ δʼ ἐλίποντο ὀρφαναὶ ἐν μεγάροισι, κόμισσε δὲ δῖʼ Ἀφροδίτη τυρῷ καὶ μέλιτι γλυκερῷ καὶ ἡδέϊ οἴνῳ· Ἥρη δʼ αὐτῇσιν περὶ πασέων δῶκε γυναικῶν εἶδος καὶ πινυτήν, μῆκος δʼ ἔπορʼ Ἄρτεμις ἁγνή, ἔργα δʼ Ἀθηναίη δέδαε κλυτὰ ἐργάζεσθαι. εὖτʼ Ἀφροδίτη δῖα προσέστιχε μακρὸν Ὄλυμπον, κούρῃς αἰτήσουσα τέλος θαλεροῖο γάμοιο— ἐς Δία τερπικέραυνον, ὁ γάρ τʼ εὖ οἶδεν ἅπαντα, μοῖράν τʼ ἀμμορίην τε καταθνητῶν ἀνθρώπων— τόφρα δὲ τὰς κούρας ἅρπυιαι ἀνηρείψαντο καί ῥʼ ἔδοσαν στυγερῇσιν ἐρινύσιν ἀμφιπολεύειν· ὣς ἔμʼ ἀϊστώσειαν Ὀλύμπια δώματʼ ἔχοντες, ἠέ μʼ ἐϋπλόκαμος βάλοι Ἄρτεμις, ὄφρʼ Ὀδυσῆα ὀσσομένη καὶ γαῖαν ὕπο στυγερὴν ἀφικοίμην, μηδέ τι χείρονος ἀνδρὸς ἐϋφραίνοιμι νόημα. ἀλλὰ τὸ μὲν καὶ ἀνεκτὸν ἔχει κακόν, ὁππότε κέν τις ἤματα μὲν κλαίῃ, πυκινῶς ἀκαχήμενος ἦτορ, νύκτας δʼ ὕπνος ἔχῃσιν—ὁ γάρ τʼ ἐπέλησεν ἁπάντων, ἐσθλῶν ἠδὲ κακῶν, ἐπεὶ ἄρ βλέφαρʼ ἀμφικαλύψῃ— αὐτὰρ ἐμοὶ καὶ ὀνείρατʼ ἐπέσσευεν κακὰ δαίμων. τῇδε γὰρ αὖ μοι νυκτὶ παρέδραθεν εἴκελος αὐτῷ, τοῖος ἐὼν οἷος ᾖεν ἅμα στρατῷ· αὐτὰρ ἐμὸν κῆρ χαῖρʼ, ἐπεὶ οὐκ ἐφάμην ὄναρ ἔμμεναι, ἀλλʼ ὕπαρ ἤδη.
"On this the day broke, but Odysseus heard the sound of her weeping, and it puzzled him, for it seemed as though she already knew him and was by his side. Then he gathered up the cloak and the fleeces on which he had lain, and set them on a seat in the room, but he took the bullock's hide out into the open. He lifted up his hands to heaven, and prayed, saying ""Father Zeus, since you have seen fit to bring me over land and sea to my own home after all the afflictions you have laid upon me, give me a sign out of the mouth of some one or other of those who are now waking within the house, and let me have another sign of some kind from outside."""	ὣς ἔφατʼ, αὐτίκα δὲ χρυσόθρονος ἤλυθεν Ἠώς. τῆς δʼ ἄρα κλαιούσης ὄπα σύνθετο δῖος Ὀδυσσεύς· μερμήριζε δʼ ἔπειτα, δόκησε δέ οἱ κατὰ θυμὸν ἤδη γιγνώσκουσα παρεστάμεναι κεφαλῆφι. χλαῖναν μὲν συνελὼν καὶ κώεα, τοῖσιν ἐνεῦδεν, ἐς μέγαρον κατέθηκεν ἐπὶ θρόνου, ἐκ δὲ βοείην θῆκε θύραζε φέρων, Διὶ δʼ εὔξατο χεῖρας ἀνασχών· Ζεῦ πάτερ, εἴ μʼ ἐθέλοντες ἐπὶ τραφερήν τε καὶ ὑγρὴν ἤγετʼ ἐμὴν ἐς γαῖαν, ἐπεί μʼ ἐκακώσατε λίην, φήμην τίς μοι φάσθω ἐγειρομένων ἀνθρώπων ἔνδοθεν, ἔκτοσθεν δὲ Διὸς τέρας ἄλλο φανήτω.
"Thus did he pray. Zeus heard his prayer and forthwith thundered high up among the from the splendor of Olympus , and Odysseus was glad when he heard it. At the same time within the house, a miller-woman from hard by in the mill room lifted up her voice and gave him another sign. There were twelve miller-women whose business it was to grind wheat and barley which are the staff of life. The others had ground their task and had gone to take their rest, but this one had not yet finished, for she was not so strong as they were, and when she heard the thunder she stopped grinding and gave the sign   to her master. ""Father Zeus,"" said she, ""you who rule over heaven and earth, you have thundered from a clear sky without so much as a cloud in it, and this means something for somebody; answer the prayer, then, of me your poor servant who calls upon you, and let this be the very last day that the suitors dine in the house of Odysseus. They have worn me out with the labor of grinding meal for them, and I hope they may never have another dinner anywhere at all."""	ὣς ἔφατʼ εὐχόμενος· τοῦ δʼ ἔκλυε μητίετα Ζεύς, αὐτίκα δʼ ἐβρόντησεν ἀπʼ αἰγλήεντος Ὀλύμπου, ὑψόθεν ἐκ νεφέων· γήθησε δὲ δῖος Ὀδυσσεύς. φήμην δʼ ἐξ οἴκοιο γυνὴ προέηκεν ἀλετρὶς πλησίον, ἔνθʼ ἄρα οἱ μύλαι ἥατο ποιμένι λαῶν, τῇσιν δώδεκα πᾶσαι ἐπερρώοντο γυναῖκες ἄλφιτα τεύχουσαι καὶ ἀλείατα, μυελὸν ἀνδρῶν. αἱ μὲν ἄρʼ ἄλλαι εὗδον, ἐπεὶ κατὰ πυρὸν ἄλεσσαν, ἡ δὲ μίʼ οὔπω παύετʼ, ἀφαυροτάτη δʼ ἐτέτυκτο· ἥ ῥα μύλην στήσασα ἔπος φάτο, σῆμα ἄνακτι· Ζεῦ πάτερ, ὅς τε θεοῖσι καὶ ἀνθρώποισιν ἀνάσσεις, ἦ μεγάλʼ ἐβρόντησας ἀπʼ οὐρανοῦ ἀστερόεντος, οὐδέ ποθι νέφος ἐστί· τέρας νύ τεῳ τόδε φαίνεις. κρῆνον νῦν καὶ ἐμοὶ δειλῇ ἔπος, ὅττι κεν εἴπω· μνηστῆρες πύματόν τε καὶ ὕστατον ἤματι τῷδε ἐν μεγάροις Ὀδυσῆος ἑλοίατο δαῖτʼ ἐρατεινήν, οἳ δή μοι καμάτῳ θυμαλγέι· γούνατʼ ἔλυσαν ἄλφιτα τευχούσῃ· νῦν ὕστατα δειπνήσειαν.
Odysseus was glad when he heard the omens conveyed to him by the woman's speech, and by the thunder, for he knew they meant that he should avenge himself on the suitors.	ὣς ἄρʼ ἔφη, χαῖρεν δὲ κλεηδόνι δῖος Ὀδυσσεὺς Ζηνός τε βροντῇ· φάτο γὰρ τίσασθαι ἀλείτας.
"Then the other maids in the house rose and lit the fire on the hearth; Telemakhos also rose and put on his clothes. He girded his sword about his shoulder, bound his sandals on his comely feet, and took a doughty spear with a point of sharpened bronze; then he went to the threshold of the room and said to Eurykleia, ""Nurse, did you make the stranger comfortable both as regards bed and board, or did you let him shift for himself? - for my mother, good woman though she is, has a way of paying great attention to second-rate people, and of neglecting others who are in reality much better men."""	αἱ δʼ ἄλλαι δμῳαὶ κατὰ δώματα κάλʼ Ὀδυσῆος ἀγρόμεναι ἀνέκαιον ἐπʼ ἐσχάρῃ ἀκάματον πῦρ.

"""Do not find fault, child,"" said Eurykleia, ""when there is no one to find fault with. The stranger sat and drank his wine as long as he liked: your mother did ask him if he would take any more bread and he said he would not. When he wanted to go to bed she told the servants to make one for him, but he said he was such a wretched outcast that he would not sleep on a bed and under blankets; he insisted on having an undressed bullock's hide and some sheepskins put for him in the room and I threw a cloak over him myself."""	τὸν δʼ αὖτε προσέειπε περίφρων Εὐρύκλεια· οὐκ ἄν μιν νῦν, τέκνον, ἀναίτιον αἰτιόῳο. οἶνον μὲν γὰρ πῖνε καθήμενος, ὄφρʼ ἔθελʼ αὐτός, σίτου δʼ οὐκέτʼ ἔφη πεινήμεναι· εἴρετο γάρ μιν. ἀλλʼ ὅτε δὴ κοίτοιο καὶ ὕπνου μιμνήσκοιτο, ἡ μὲν δέμνιʼ ἄνωγεν ὑποστορέσαι δμῳῇσιν, αὐτὰρ ὅ γʼ, ὥς τις πάμπαν ὀϊζυρὸς καὶ ἄποτμος, οὐκ ἔθελʼ ἐν λέκτροισι καὶ ἐν ῥήγεσσι καθεύδειν, ἀλλʼ ἐν ἀδεψήτῳ βοέῃ καὶ κώεσιν οἰῶν ἔδραθʼ ἐνὶ προδόμῳ· χλαῖναν δʼ ἐπιέσσαμεν ἡμεῖς.
"Then Telemakhos went out of the court to the place where the Achaeans were meeting in assembly; he had his spear in his hand, and he was not alone, for his two dogs went with him. But Eurykleia called the maids and said, ""Come, wake up; set about sweeping the cloisters and sprinkling them with water to lay the dust; put the covers on the seats; wipe down the tables, some of you, with a wet sponge; clean out the mixing-jugs and the cups, and for water from the fountain at once; the suitors will be here directly; they will be here early, for it is a feast day."""	ὣς φάτο, Τηλέμαχος δὲ διὲκ μεγάροιο βεβήκει ἔγχος ἔχων, ἅμα τῷ γε δύω κύνες ἀργοὶ ἕποντο. βῆ δʼ ἴμεν εἰς ἀγορὴν μετʼ ἐϋκνήμιδας Ἀχαιούς. ἡ δʼ αὖτε δμῳῇσιν ἐκέκλετο δῖα γυναικῶν, Εὐρύκλειʼ, Ὦπος θυγάτηρ Πεισηνορίδαο· ἀγρεῖθʼ, αἱ μὲν δῶμα κορήσατε ποιπνύσασαι, ῥάσσατέ τʼ, ἔν τε θρόνοις εὐποιήτοισι τάπητας βάλλετε πορφυρέους· αἱ δὲ σπόγγοισι τραπέζας πάσας ἀμφιμάσασθε, καθήρατε δὲ κρητῆρας καὶ δέπα ἀμφικύπελλα τετυγμένα· ταὶ δὲ μεθʼ ὕδωρ ἔρχεσθε κρήνηνδε, καὶ οἴσετε θᾶσσον ἰοῦσαι. οὐ γὰρ δὴν μνηστῆρες ἀπέσσονται μεγάροιο, ἀλλὰ μάλʼ ἦρι νέονται, ἐπεὶ καὶ πᾶσιν ἑορτή.
"Thus did she speak, and they did even as she had said: twenty of them went to the fountain for water, and the others set themselves busily to work about the house. The men who were in attendance on the suitors also came up and began chopping firewood. By and by the women returned from the fountain, and the swineherd came after them with the three best pigs he could pick out. These he let feed about the premises, and then he said with good humor to Odysseus, ""Stranger, are the suitors treating you any better now, or are they as insolent as ever?"""	ὣς ἔφαθʼ, αἱ δʼ ἄρα τῆς μάλα μὲν κλύον ἠδʼ ἐπίθοντο. αἱ μὲν ἐείκοσι βῆσαν ἐπὶ κρήνην μελάνυδρον, αἱ δʼ αὐτοῦ κατὰ δώματʼ ἐπισταμένως πονέοντο. ἐς δʼ ἦλθον δρηστῆρες Ἀχαιῶν. οἱ μὲν ἔπειτα εὖ καὶ ἐπισταμένως κέασαν ξύλα, ταὶ δὲ γυναῖκες ἦλθον ἀπὸ κρήνης· ἐπὶ δέ σφισιν ἦλθε συβώτης τρεῖς σιάλους κατάγων, οἳ ἔσαν μετὰ πᾶσιν ἄριστοι. καὶ τοὺς μέν ῥʼ εἴασε καθʼ ἕρκεα καλὰ νέμεσθαι, αὐτὸς δʼ αὖτʼ Ὀδυσῆα προσηύδα μειλιχίοισι· ξεῖνʼ, ἦ ἄρ τί σε μᾶλλον Ἀχαιοὶ εἰσορόωσιν, ἦέ σʼ ἀτιμάζουσι κατὰ μέγαρʼ, ὡς τὸ πάρος περ; τὸν δʼ ἀπαμειβόμενος προσέφη πολυμήτις Ὀδυσσεύς·
"""May heaven,"" answered Odysseus, ""requite to them the wickedness with which they deal high-handedly in another man's house without any sense of shame  ."""	αἲ γὰρ δή, Εὔμαιε, θεοὶ τισαίατο λώβην, ἣν οἵδʼ ὑβρίζοντες ἀτάσθαλα μηχανόωνται οἴκῳ ἐν ἀλλοτρίῳ, οὐδʼ αἰδοῦς μοῖραν ἔχουσιν.
"Thus did they converse; meanwhile Melanthios the goatherd came up, for he too was bringing in his best goats for the suitors’ dinner; and he had two shepherds with him. They tied the goats up under the gatehouse, and then Melanthios began gibing at Odysseus. ""Are you still here, stranger,"" said he, ""to pester people by begging about the house? Why can you not go elsewhere? You and I shall not come to an understanding before we have given each other a taste of our fists. You beg without any sense of decency  : are there not feasts elsewhere among the Achaeans, as well as here?"""	ὣς οἱ μὲν τοιαῦτα πρὸς ἀλλήλους ἀγόρευον, ἀγχίμολον δέ σφʼ ἦλθε Μελάνθιος, αἰπόλος αἰγῶν. αἶγας ἄγων αἳ πᾶσι μετέρεπον αἰπολίοισι, δεῖπνον μνηστήρεσσι. δύω δʼ ἅμʼ ἕποντο νομῆες. καὶ τὰς μὲν κατέδησεν ὑπʼ αἰθούσῃ ἐριδούπῳ, αὐτὸς δʼ αὖτʼ Ὀδυσῆα προσηύδα κερτομίοισι· ξεῖνʼ, ἔτι καὶ νῦν ἐνθάδʼ ἀνιήσεις κατὰ δῶμα ἀνέρας αἰτίζων, ἀτὰρ οὐκ ἔξεισθα θύραζε; πάντως οὐκέτι νῶϊ διακρινέεσθαι ὀΐω πρὶν χειρῶν γεύσασθαι, ἐπεὶ σύ περ οὐ κατὰ κόσμον αἰτίζεις· εἰσὶν δὲ καὶ ἄλλαι δαῖτες Ἀχαιῶν.
"Odysseus made no answer, but bowed his head and brooded. Then a third man, Philoitios, joined them, who was bringing in a barren heifer and some goats. These were brought over by the boatmen who are there to take people over when any one comes to them. So Philoitios made his heifer and his goats secure under the gatehouse, and then went up to the swineherd. ""Who, Swineherd,"" said he, ""is this stranger that is lately come here? Is he one of your men? What is his family? Where does he come from? Poor fellow, he looks as if he had been some great man, but the gods give sorrow to whom they will - even to kings if it so pleases them"	ὣς φάτο, τὸν δʼ οὔ τι προσέφη πολύμητις Ὀδυσσεύς, ἀλλʼ ἀκέων κίνησε κάρη, κακὰ βυσσοδομεύων. τοῖσι δʼ ἐπὶ τρίτος ἦλθε Φιλοίτιος, ὄρχαμος ἀνδρῶν, βοῦν στεῖραν μνηστῆρσιν ἄγων καὶ πίονας αἶγας. πορθμῆες δʼ ἄρα τούς γε διήγαγον, οἵ τε καὶ ἄλλους ἀνθρώπους πέμπουσιν, ὅτις σφέας εἰσαφίκηται. καὶ τὰ μὲν εὖ κατέδησεν ὑπʼ αἰθούσῃ ἐριδούπῳ, αὐτὸς δʼ αὖτʼ ἐρέεινε συβώτην ἄγχι παραστάς· τίς δὴ ὅδε ξεῖνος νέον εἰλήλουθε, συβῶτα, ἡμέτερον πρὸς δῶμα; τέων δʼ ἐξ εὔχεται εἶναι ἀνδρῶν; ποῦ δέ νύ οἱ γενεὴ καὶ πατρὶς ἄρουρα; δύσμορος, ἦ τε ἔοικε δέμας βασιλῆϊ ἄνακτι· ἀλλὰ θεοὶ δυόωσι πολυπλάγκτους ἀνθρώπους, ὁππότε καὶ βασιλεῦσιν ἐπικλώσωνται ὀϊζύν.
"As he spoke he went up to Odysseus and saluted him with his right hand; ""Good day to you, father stranger,"" said he, ""you seem to be very poorly off now, but I hope you will have better times   by and by. Father Zeus, of all gods you are the most malicious. We are your own children, yet you show us no mercy in all our misery and afflictions. A sweat came over me when I saw this man, and my eyes filled with tears, for he reminds me of Odysseus, who I fear is going about in just such rags as this man's are, if indeed he is still among the living. If he is already dead and in the house of Hades, then, alas! for my good master, who made me his stockman when I was quite young in the of the Cephallênians, and now his cattle are countless; no one could have done better with them than I have, for they have bred like ears of wheat; nevertheless I have to keep bringing them in for others to eat, who take no heed of his son though he is in the house, and fear not the wrath of heaven, but are already eager to divide Odysseus’ property among them because he has been away so long. I have often thought - only it would not be right while his son is living - of going off with the cattle to some foreign ; bad as this would be, it is still harder to stay here and be ill-treated about other people's herds. My position is intolerable, and I should long since have run away and put myself under the protection of some other chief, only that I believe my poor master will yet return, and send all these suitors fleeing out of the house."""	ἦ καὶ δεξιτερῇ δειδίσκετο χειρὶ παραστάς, καί μιν φωνήσας ἔπεα πτερόεντα προσηύδα· χαῖρε, πάτερ ὦ ξεῖνε· γένοιτό τοι ἔς περ ὀπίσσω ὄλβος· ἀτὰρ μὲν νῦν γε κακοῖς ἔχεαι πολέεσσι.

"""Stockman,"" answered Odysseus, ""you seem to be a very well-disposed person, and I can see that you are a man of sense. Therefore I will tell you, and will confirm my words with an oath: by Zeus, the chief of all gods, and by that hearth of Odysseus to which I am now come, Odysseus shall return before you leave this place, and if you are so minded you shall see him killing the suitors who are now masters here."""	τὸν δʼ ἀπαμειβόμενος προσέφη πολύμητις Ὀδυσσεύς· βουκόλʼ, ἐπεὶ οὔτε κακῷ οὔτʼ ἄφρονι φωτὶ ἔοικας, γιγνώσκω δὲ καὶ αὐτὸς ὅ τοι πινυτὴ φρένας ἵκει, τοὔνεκά τοι ἐρέω καὶ ἐπὶ μέγαν ὅρκον ὀμοῦμαι· ἴστω νῦν Ζεὺς πρῶτα θεῶν ξενίη τε τράπεζα ἱστίη τʼ Ὀδυσῆος ἀμύμονος, ἣν ἀφικάνω, ἦ σέθεν ἐνθάδʼ ἐόντος ἐλεύσεται οἴκαδʼ Ὀδυσσεύς· σοῖσιν δʼ ὀφθαλμοῖσιν ἐπόψεαι, αἴ κʼ ἐθέλῃσθα, κτεινομένους μνηστῆρας, οἳ ἐνθάδε κοιρανέουσιν.
"""If Zeus were to bring this to pass,"" replied the stockman, ""you should see how I would do my very utmost to help him."""	τὸν δʼ αὖτε προσέειπε βοῶν ἐπιβουκόλος ἀνήρ· αἲ γὰρ τοῦτο, ξεῖνε, ἔπος τελέσειε Κρονίων· γνοίης χʼ οἵη ἐμὴ δύναμις καὶ χεῖρες ἕπονται.
And in like manner Eumaios prayed that Odysseus might return home.	ὣς δʼ αὔτως Εὔμαιος ἐπεύξατο πᾶσι θεοῖσι νοστῆσαι Ὀδυσῆα πολύφρονα ὅνδε δόμονδε.
"Thus did they converse. Meanwhile the suitors were hatching a plot to murder Telemakhos: but a bird flew near them on their left hand - an eagle with a dove in its talons. On this Amphinomos said, ""My friends, this plot of ours to murder Telemakhos will not succeed; let us go to dinner instead."""	ὣς οἱ μὲν τοιαῦτα πρὸς ἀλλήλους ἀγόρευον, μνηστῆρες δʼ ἄρα Τηλεμάχῳ θάνατόν τε μόρον τε ἤρτυον· αὐτὰρ ὁ τοῖσιν ἀριστερὸς ἤλυθεν ὄρνις, αἰετὸς ὑψιπέτης, ἔχε δὲ τρήρωνα πέλειαν. τοῖσιν δʼ Ἀμφίνομος ἀγορήσατο καὶ μετέειπεν· ὦ φίλοι, οὐχ ἡμῖν συνθεύσεται ἥδε γε βουλή, Τηλεμάχοιο φόνος· ἀλλὰ μνησώμεθα δαιτός.
The others assented, so they went inside and laid their cloaks on the benches and seats. They sacrificed the sheep, goats, pigs, and the heifer, and when the inward meats were cooked they served them round. They mixed the wine in the mixing-bowls, and the swineherd gave every man his cup, while Philoitios handed round the bread in the breadbaskets, and Melanthios poured them out their wine. Then they laid their hands upon the good things that were before them.	ὣς ἔφατʼ Ἀμφίνομος, τοῖσιν δʼ ἐπιήνδανε μῦθος. ἐλθόντες δʼ ἐς δώματʼ Ὀδυσσῆος θείοιο χλαίνας μὲν κατέθεντο κατὰ κλισμούς τε θρόνους τε, οἱ δʼ ἱέρευον ὄϊς μεγάλους καὶ πίονας αἶγας, ἵρευον δὲ σύας σιάλους καὶ βοῦν ἀγελαίην· σπλάγχνα δʼ ἄρʼ ὀπτήσαντες ἐνώμων, ἐν δέ τε οἶνον κρητῆρσιν κερόωντο· κύπελλα δὲ νεῖμε συβώτης. σῖτον δέ σφʼ ἐπένειμε Φιλοίτιος, ὄρχαμος ἀνδρῶν, καλοῖς ἐν κανέοισιν, ἐῳνοχόει δὲ Μελανθεύς. οἱ δʼ ἐπʼ ὀνείαθʼ ἑτοῖμα προκείμενα χεῖρας ἴαλλον.
"Telemakhos deliberately   made Odysseus sit in the part of the room that was paved with stone; he gave him a shabby-looking seat at a little table to himself, and had his portion of the inward meats brought to him, with his wine in a gold cup. ""Sit there,"" said he, ""and drink your wine among the great people. I will put a stop to the gibes and blows of the suitors, for this is no public house, but belongs to Odysseus, and has passed from him to me. Therefore, suitors, keep your hands and your tongues to yourselves, or there will be trouble."""

"The suitors bit their lips, and marveled at the boldness of his speech; then Antinoos said, ""We do not like such language but we will put up with it, for Telemakhos is threatening us in good earnest. If Zeus had let us we should have put a stop to his brave talk ere now."""	ὣς ἔφαθʼ, οἱ δʼ ἄρα πάντες ὀδὰξ ἐν χείλεσι φύντες Τηλέμαχον θαύμαζον, ὃ θαρσαλέως ἀγόρευε. τοῖσιν δʼ Ἀντίνοος μετέφη, Εὐπείθεος υἱός· καὶ χαλεπόν περ ἐόντα δεχώμεθα μῦθον, Ἀχαιοί, Τηλεμάχου· μάλα δʼ ἧμιν ἀπειλήσας ἀγορεύει. οὐ γὰρ Ζεὺς εἴασε Κρονίων· τῷ κέ μιν ἤδη παύσαμεν ἐν μεγάροισι, λιγύν περ ἐόντʼ ἀγορητήν.
Thus spoke Antinoos, but Telemakhos heeded him not. Meanwhile the heralds were bringing the holy hecatomb through the city, and the Achaeans gathered under the shady grove of Apollo.	ὣς ἔφατʼ Ἀντίνοος· ὁ δʼ ἄρʼ οὐκ ἐμπάζετο μύθων. κήρυκες δʼ ἀνὰ ἄστυ θεῶν ἱερὴν ἑκατόμβην ἦγον· τοὶ δʼ ἀγέροντο κάρη κομόωντες Ἀχαιοὶ ἄλσος ὕπο σκιερὸν ἑκατηβόλου Ἀπόλλωνος.
Then they roasted the outer meat, drew it off the spits, gave every man his portion, and feasted to their hearts’ content; those who waited at table gave Odysseus exactly the same portion as the others had, for Telemakhos had told them to do so.	οἱ δʼ ἐπεὶ ὤπτησαν κρέʼ ὑπέρτερα καὶ ἐρύσαντο, μοίρας δασσάμενοι δαίνυντʼ ἐρικυδέα δαῖτα· πὰρ δʼ ἄρʼ Ὀδυσσῆϊ μοῖραν θέσαν οἳ πονέοντο ἴσην, ὡς αὐτοί περ ἐλάγχανον· ὣς γὰρ ἀνώγει Τηλέμαχος, φίλος υἱὸς Ὀδυσσῆος θείοιο.
"But Athena would not let the suitors for one moment drop their insolence, for she wanted Odysseus to become still more bitter   against them. Now there happened to be among them a ribald fellow, whose name was Ktesippos, and who came from Same. This man, confident in his great wealth, was paying court to the wife of Odysseus, and said to the suitors, ""Hear what I have to say. The stranger has already had as large a portion as any one else; this is well, for it is not right nor reasonable   to ill-treat any guest of Telemakhos who comes here. I will, however, make him a present on my own account, that he may have something to give to the bath-woman, or to some other of Odysseus’ servants."""	μνηστῆρας δʼ οὐ πάμπαν ἀγήνορας εἴα Ἀθήνη λώβης ἴσχεσθαι θυμαλγέος, ὄφρʼ ἔτι μᾶλλον δύη ἄχος κραδίην Λαερτιάδην Ὀδυσῆα. ἦν δέ τις ἐν μνηστῆρσιν ἀνὴρ ἀθεμίστια εἰδώς, Κτήσιππος δʼ ὄνομʼ ἔσκε, Σάμῃ δʼ ἐνὶ οἰκία ναῖεν· ὃς δή τοι κτεάτεσσι πεποιθὼς θεσπεσίοισι μνάσκετʼ Ὀδυσσῆος δὴν οἰχομένοιο δάμαρτα. ὅς ῥα τότε μνηστῆρσιν ὑπερφιάλοισι μετηύδα· κέκλυτέ μευ, μνηστῆρες ἀγήνορες, ὄφρα τι εἴπω· μοῖραν μὲν δὴ ξεῖνος ἔχει πάλαι, ὡς ἐπέοικεν, ἴσην· οὐ γὰρ καλὸν ἀτέμβειν οὐδὲ δίκαιον ξείνους Τηλεμάχου, ὅς κεν τάδε δώμαθʼ ἵκηται. ἀλλʼ ἄγε οἱ καὶ ἐγὼ δῶ ξείνιον, ὄφρα καὶ αὐτὸς ἠὲ λοετροχόῳ δώῃ γέρας ἠέ τῳ ἄλλῳ δμώων, οἳ κατὰ δώματʼ Ὀδυσσῆος θείοιο.
"As he spoke he picked up a heifer's foot from the meat-basket in which it lay, and threw it at Odysseus, but Odysseus turned his head a little aside, and avoided it, smiling sardonically as he did so, and it hit the wall, not him. On this Telemakhos spoke fiercely to Ktesippos, ""It is a good thing for you,"" said he, ""that the stranger turned his head so that you missed him. If you had hit him I should have run you through with my spear, and your father would have had to see about getting you buried rather than married in this house. So let me have no more unseemly behavior from any of you, for I am grown up now to the knowledge of good and evil and understand what is going on, instead of being the child that I have been heretofore. I have long seen you killing my sheep and making free with my grain and wine: I have put up with this, for one man is no match for many, but do me no further violence. Still, if you wish to kill me, kill me; I would far rather die than see such disgraceful scenes day after day - guests insulted, and men dragging the women servants about the house in an unseemly way."""	ὣς εἰπὼν ἔρριψε βοὸς πόδα χειρὶ παχείῃ. κείμενον ἐκ κανέοιο λαβών· ὁ δʼ ἀλεύατʼ Ὀδυσσεὺς ἦκα παρακλίνας κεφαλήν, μείδησε δὲ θυμῷ σαρδάνιον μάλα τοῖον· ὁ δʼ εὔδμητον βάλε τοῖχον.

"They all held their peace till at last Agelaos son of Damastor said, ""No one should take offense at what has just been said, nor gainsay it, for it is quite reasonable  . Leave off, therefore, ill-treating the stranger, or any one else of the servants who are about the house; I would say, however, a friendly word to Telemakhos and his mother, which I trust may commend itself to both. ‘As long,’ I would say, ‘as you had ground for hoping that Odysseus would one day come home, there will be no as a result of your waiting and suffering the suitors to be in your house. It would have been better that he should have returned, but it is now sufficiently clear that he will never do so; therefore talk all this quietly over with your mother, and tell her to marry the best man, and the one who makes her the most advantageous offer. Thus you will yourself be able to manage your own inheritance, and to eat and drink in peace, while your mother will look after some other man's house, not yours.""’"	ὣς ἔφαθʼ, οἱ δʼ ἄρα πάντες ἀκὴν ἐγένοντο σιωπῇ· ὀψὲ δὲ δὴ μετέειπε Δαμαστορίδης Ἀγέλαος· ὦ φίλοι, οὐκ ἂν δή τις ἐπὶ ῥηθέντι δικαίῳ ἀντιβίοις ἐπέεσσι καθαπτόμενος χαλεπαίνοι· μήτε τι τὸν ξεῖνον στυφελίζετε μήτε τινʼ ἄλλον δμώων, οἳ κατὰ δώματʼ Ὀδυσσῆος θείοιο.

"To this Telemakhos answered, ""By Zeus, Agelaos, and by the sorrows of my unhappy father, who has either perished far from Ithaca , or is wandering in some distant land, I throw no obstacles in the way of my mother's marriage; on the contrary I urge her to choose whomsoever she will, and I will give her numberless gifts into the bargain, but I dare not insist point blank that she shall leave the house against her own wishes. Heaven forbid that I should do this."""	τὸν δʼ αὖ Τηλέμαχος πεπνυμένος ἀντίον ηὔδα· οὐ μὰ Ζῆνʼ, Ἀγέλαε, καὶ ἄλγεα πατρὸς ἐμοῖο, ὅς που τῆλʼ Ἰθάκης ἢ ἔφθιται ἢ ἀλάληται, οὔ τι διατρίβω μητρὸς γάμον, ἀλλὰ κελεύω γήμασθʼ ᾧ κʼ ἐθέλῃ, ποτὶ δʼ ἄσπετα δῶρα δίδωμι. αἰδέομαι δʼ ἀέκουσαν ἀπὸ μεγάροιο δίεσθαι μύθῳ ἀναγκαίῳ· μὴ τοῦτο θεὸς τελέσειεν.
"Athena now made the suitors fall to laughing immoderately, and set their wits wandering; but they were laughing with a forced laughter. Their meat became smeared with blood; their eyes filled with tears, and their hearts were heavy with forebodings. Theoklymenos saw this and said, ""Unhappy men, what is it that ails you? There is a shroud of darkness drawn over you from head to foot, your cheeks are wet with tears; the air is alive with wailing voices; the walls and roof-beams drip blood; the gate of the cloisters and the court beyond them are full of ghosts trooping down into the night of Hades; the sun is blotted out of heaven, and a blighting gloom is over all the land."""	ὣς φάτο Τηλέμαχος· μνηστῆρσι δὲ Παλλὰς Ἀθήνη ἄσβεστον γέλω ὦρσε, παρέπλαγξεν δὲ νόημα. οἱ δʼ ἤδη γναθμοῖσι γελοίων ἀλλοτρίοισιν, αἱμοφόρυκτα δὲ δὴ κρέα ἤσθιον· ὄσσε δʼ ἄρα σφέων δακρυόφιν πίμπλαντο, γόον δʼ ὠΐετο θυμός. τοῖσι δὲ καὶ μετέειπε Θεοκλύμενος θεοειδής· ἆ δειλοί, τί κακὸν τόδε πάσχετε; νυκτὶ μὲν ὑμέων εἰλύαται κεφαλαί τε πρόσωπά τε νέρθε τε γοῦνα. οἰμωγὴ δὲ δέδηε, δεδάκρυνται δὲ παρειαί, αἵματι δʼ ἐρράδαται τοῖχοι καλαί τε μεσόδμαι· εἰδώλων δὲ πλέον πρόθυρον, πλείη δὲ καὶ αὐλή, ἱεμένων Ἔρεβόσδε ὑπὸ ζόφον· ἠέλιος δὲ οὐρανοῦ ἐξαπόλωλε, κακὴ δʼ ἐπιδέδρομεν ἀχλύς.
"Thus did he speak, and they all of them laughed heartily. Eurymakhos then said, ""This stranger who has lately come here has lost his senses. Servants, turn him out into the streets, since he finds it so dark here."""	ὣς ἔφαθʼ, οἱ δʼ ἄρα πάντες ἐπʼ αὐτῷ ἡδὺ γέλασσαν. τοῖσιν δʼ Εὐρύμαχος, Πολύβου πάϊς, ἦρχʼ ἀγορεύειν· ἀφραίνει ξεῖνος νέον ἄλλοθεν εἰληλουθώς. ἀλλά μιν αἶψα, νέοι, δόμου ἐκπέμψασθε θύραζε εἰς ἀγορὴν ἔρχεσθαι, ἐπεὶ τάδε νυκτὶ ἐΐσκει.
"But Theoklymenos said, ""Eurymakhos, you need not send any one with me. I have eyes, ears, and a pair of feet of my own, to say nothing of an understanding mind  . I will take these out of the house with me, for I see mischief overhanging you, from which not one of you men who are insulting people and plotting ill deeds in the house of Odysseus will be able to escape."""	τὸν δʼ αὖτε προσέειπε Θεοκλύμενος θεοειδής· Εὐρύμαχʼ, οὔ τί σʼ ἄνωγα ἐμοὶ πομπῆας ὀπάζειν· εἰσί μοι ὀφθαλμοί τε καὶ οὔατα καὶ πόδες ἄμφω καὶ νόος ἐν στήθεσσι τετυγμένος οὐδὲν ἀεικής. τοῖς ἔξειμι θύραζε, ἐπεὶ νοέω κακὸν ὔμμιν ἐρχόμενον, τό κεν οὔ τις ὑπεκφύγοι οὐδʼ ἀλέαιτο μνηστήρων, οἳ δῶμα κάτʼ ἀντιθέου Ὀδυσῆος ἀνέρας ὑβρίζοντες ἀτάσθαλα μηχανάασθε.
"He left the house as he spoke, and went back to Peiraios who gave him welcome, but the suitors kept looking at one another and provoking Telemakhos by laughing at the strangers. One insolent fellow said to him, ""Telemakhos, you are not happy in your guests; first you have this importunate tramp, who comes begging bread and wine and has no skill for work or for hard fighting  , but is perfectly useless, and now here is another fellow who is setting himself up as a seer. Let me persuade you, for it will be much better, to put them on board ship and send them off to the Sicels to sell for what they will bring."""	ὣς εἰπὼν ἐξῆλθε δόμων εὖ ναιεταόντων, ἵκετο δʼ ἐς Πείραιον, ὅ μιν πρόφρων ὑπέδεκτο. μνηστῆρες δʼ ἄρα πάντες ἐς ἀλλήλους ὁρόωντες Τηλέμαχον ἐρέθιζον, ἐπὶ ξείνοις γελόωντες· ὧδε δέ τις εἴπεσκε νέων ὑπερηνορεόντων· Τηλέμαχʼ, οὔ τις σεῖο κακοξεινώτερος ἄλλος· οἷον μέν τινα τοῦτον ἔχεις ἐπίμαστον ἀλήτην, σίτου καὶ οἴνου κεχρημένον, οὐδέ τι ἔργων ἔμπαιον οὐδὲ βίης, ἀλλʼ αὔτως ἄχθος ἀρούρης. ἄλλος δʼ αὖτέ τις οὗτος ἀνέστη μαντεύεσθαι. ἀλλʼ εἴ μοί τι πίθοιο, τό κεν πολὺ κέρδιον εἴη· τοὺς ξείνους ἐν νηῒ πολυκληῗδι βαλόντες ἐς Σικελοὺς πέμψωμεν, ὅθεν κέ τοι ἄξιον ἄλφοι.
Telemakhos gave him no heed, but sat silently watching his father, expecting every moment that he would begin his attack upon the suitors.	ὣς ἔφασαν μνηστῆρες· ὁ δʼ οὐκ ἐμπάζετο μύθων, ἀλλʼ ἀκέων πατέρα προσεδέρκετο, δέγμενος αἰεί, ὁππότε δὴ μνηστῆρσιν ἀναιδέσι χεῖρας ἐφήσει.
Meanwhile the daughter of Ikarios, wise Penelope, had had a rich seat placed for her facing the court and cloisters, so that she could hear what every one was saying. The dinner indeed had been prepared amid merriment; it had been both good and abundant, for they had sacrificed many victims; but the supper was yet to come, and nothing can be conceived more gruesome than the meal which a goddess and a brave man were soon to lay before them - for they had brought their doom upon themselves.	ἡ δὲ κατʼ ἄντηστιν θεμένη περικαλλέα δίφρον κούρη Ἰκαρίοιο, περίφρων Πηνελόπεια, ἀνδρῶν ἐν μεγάροισιν ἑκάστου μῦθον ἄκουεν. δεῖπνον μὲν γάρ τοί γε γελοίωντες τετύκοντο ἡδὺ τε καὶ μενοεικές, ἐπεὶ μάλα πόλλʼ ἱέρευσαν· δόρπου δʼ οὐκ ἄν πως ἀχαρίστερον ἄλλο γένοιτο, οἷον δὴ τάχʼ ἔμελλε θεὰ καὶ καρτερὸς ἀνὴρ
Athena now put it in Penelope's mind to make the suitors try their skill with the bow and with the iron axes, in contest among themselves, as a means of bringing about their destruction. She went upstairs and got the store room key, which was made of bronze and had a handle of ivory; she then went with her maidens into the store room at the end of the house, where her husband's treasures of gold, bronze, and wrought iron were kept, and where was also his bow, and the quiver full of deadly arrows that had been given him by a friend whom he had met in Lacedaemon - Iphitos the son of Eurytos. The two fell in with one another in Messene at the house of Ortilokhos, where Odysseus was staying in order to recover a debt that was owing from the whole ; for the Messenians had carried off three hundred sheep from Ithaca , and had sailed away with them and with their shepherds. In quest of these Odysseus took a long journey while still quite young, for his father and the other chieftains sent him on a mission to recover them. Iphitos had gone there also to try and get back twelve brood mares that he had lost, and the mule foals that were running with them. These mares were the death of him in the end, for when he went to the house of Zeus’ son, mighty Herakles, who performed such prodigies of valor, Herakles to his shame killed him, though he was his guest, for he feared not heaven's vengeance, nor yet respected his own table which he had set before Iphitos, but killed him in spite of everything, and kept the mares himself. It was when claiming these that Iphitos met Odysseus, and gave him the bow which mighty Eurytos had been used to carry, and which on his death had been left by him to his son. Odysseus gave him in return a sword and a spear, and this was the beginning of a fast friendship, although they never visited at one another's houses, for Zeus’ son Herakles killed Iphitos ere they could do so. This bow, then, given him by Iphitos, had not been taken with him by Odysseus when he sailed for Troy ; he had used it so long as he had been at home, but had left it behind as having been a keepsake from a valued friend.	τῇ δʼ ἄρʼ ἐπὶ φρεσὶ θῆκε θεὰ γλαυκῶπις Ἀθήνη, κούρῃ Ἰκαρίοιο, περίφρονι Πηνελοπείῃ, τόξον μνηστήρεσσι θέμεν πολιόν τε σίδηρον ἐν μεγάροις Ὀδυσῆος, ἀέθλια καὶ φόνου ἀρχήν. κλίμακα δʼ ὑψηλὴν προσεβήσετο οἷο δόμοιο, εἵλετο δὲ κληῗδʼ εὐκαμπέα χειρὶ παχείῃ καλὴν χαλκείην· κώπη δʼ ἐλέφαντος ἐπῆεν. βῆ δʼ ἴμεναι θάλαμόνδε σὺν ἀμφιπόλοισι γυναιξὶν ἔσχατον· ἔνθα δέ οἱ κειμήλια κεῖτο ἄνακτος, χαλκός τε χρυσός τε πολύκμητός τε σίδηρος. ἔνθα δὲ τόξον κεῖτο παλίντονον ἠδὲ φαρέτρη ἰοδόκος, πολλοὶ δʼ ἔνεσαν στονόεντες ὀϊστοί, δῶρα τά οἱ ξεῖνος Λακεδαίμονι δῶκε τυχήσας Ἴφιτος Εὐρυτίδης, ἐπιείκελος ἀθανάτοισι. τὼ δʼ ἐν Μεσσήνῃ ξυμβλήτην ἀλλήλοιϊν οἴκῳ ἐν Ὀρτιλόχοιο δαΐφρονος. ἦ τοι Ὀδυσσεὺς ἦλθε μετὰ χρεῖος, τό ῥά οἱ πᾶς δῆμος ὄφελλε· μῆλα γὰρ ἐξ Ἰθάκης Μεσσήνιοι ἄνδρες ἄειραν νηυσὶ πολυκλήϊσι τριηκόσιʼ ἠδὲ νομῆας. τῶν ἕνεκʼ ἐξεσίην πολλὴν ὁδὸν ἦλθεν Ὀδυσσεὺς παιδνὸς ἐών· πρὸ γὰρ ἧκε πατὴρ ἄλλοι τε γέροντες.

Penelope presently reached the oak threshold of the store room; the carpenter had planed this duly, and had drawn a line on it so as to get it quite straight; he had then set the door posts into it and hung the doors. She loosed the strap from the handle of the door, put in the key, and drove it straight home to shoot back the bolts that held the doors; these flew open with a noise like a bull bellowing in a meadow, and Penelope stepped upon the raised platform, where the chests stood in which the fair linen and clothes were laid by along with fragrant herbs: reaching thence, she took down the bow with its bow case from the peg on which it hung. She sat down with it on her knees, weeping bitterly as she took the bow out of its case, and when her tears had relieved her, she went to the room where the suitors were, carrying the bow and the quiver, with the many deadly arrows that were inside it. Along with her came her maidens, bearing a chest that contained much iron and bronze which her husband had won as prizes. When she reached the suitors, she stood by one of the bearing-posts supporting the roof of the room, holding a veil before her face, and with a maid on either side of her. Then she said:	ἡ δʼ ὅτε δὴ θάλαμον τὸν ἀφίκετο δῖα γυναικῶν οὐδόν τε δρύϊνον προσεβήσετο, τόν ποτε τέκτων ξέσσεν ἐπισταμένως καὶ ἐπὶ στάθμην ἴθυνεν, ἐν δὲ σταθμοὺς ἄρσε, θύρας δʼ ἐπέθηκε φαεινάς, αὐτίκʼ ἄρʼ ἥ γʼ ἱμάντα θοῶς ἀπέλυσε κορώνης, ἐν δὲ κληῗδʼ ἧκε, θυρέων δʼ ἀνέκοπτεν ὀχῆας ἄντα τιτυσκομένη· τὰ δʼ ἀνέβραχεν ἠΰτε ταῦρος βοσκόμενος λειμῶνι· τόσʼ ἔβραχε καλὰ θύρετρα πληγέντα κληΐδι, πετάσθησαν δέ οἱ ὦκα. ἡ δʼ ἄρʼ ἐφʼ ὑψηλῆς σανίδος βῆ· ἔνθα δὲ χηλοὶ ἕστασαν, ἐν δʼ ἄρα τῇσι θυώδεα εἵματʼ ἔκειτο. ἔνθεν ὀρεξαμένη ἀπὸ πασσάλου αἴνυτο τόξον αὐτῷ γωρυτῷ, ὅς οἱ περίκειτο φαεινός. ἑζομένη δὲ κατʼ αὖθι, φίλοις ἐπὶ γούνασι θεῖσα, κλαῖε μάλα λιγέως, ἐκ δʼ ᾕρεε τόξον ἄνακτος. ἡ δʼ ἐπεὶ οὖν τάρφθη πολυδακρύτοιο γόοιο, βῆ ῥʼ ἴμεναι μέγαρόνδε μετὰ μνηστῆρας ἀγαυοὺς τόξον ἔχουσʼ ἐν χειρὶ παλίντονον ἠδὲ φαρέτρην ἰοδόκον· πολλοὶ δʼ ἔνεσαν στονόεντες ὀϊστοί. τῇ δʼ ἄρʼ ἅμʼ ἀμφίπολοι φέρον ὄγκιον, ἔνθα σίδηρος κεῖτο πολὺς καὶ χαλκός, ἀέθλια τοῖο ἄνακτος. ἡ δʼ ὅτε δὴ μνηστῆρας ἀφίκετο δῖα γυναικῶν, στῆ ῥα παρὰ σταθμὸν τέγεος πύκα ποιητοῖο, ἄντα παρειάων σχομένη λιπαρὰ κρήδεμνα. ἀμφίπολος δʼ ἄρα οἱ κεδνὴ ἑκάτερθε παρέστη. αὐτίκα δὲ μνηστῆρσι μετηύδα καὶ φάτο μῦθον·
"""Listen to me you suitors, who persist in abusing the hospitality of this house because its owner has been long absent, and without other pretext than that you want to marry me; this, then, being the prize that you are contending for, I will bring out the mighty bow of Odysseus, and whomsoever of you shall string it most easily and send his arrow through each one of twelve axes, him will I follow and quit this house of my lawful husband, so goodly, and so abounding in wealth. But even so I doubt not that I shall remember it in my dreams."""	κέκλυτέ μευ, μνηστῆρες ἀγήνορες, οἳ τόδε δῶμα ἐχράετʼ ἐσθιέμεν καὶ πινέμεν ἐμμενὲς αἰεὶ ἀνδρὸς ἀποιχομένοιο πολὺν χρόνον· οὐδέ τινʼ ἄλλην μύθου ποιήσασθαι ἐπισχεσίην ἐδύνασθε, ἀλλʼ ἐμὲ ἱέμενοι γῆμαι θέσθαι τε γυναῖκα. ἀλλʼ ἄγετε, μνηστῆρες, ἐπεὶ τόδε φαίνετʼ ἄεθλον. θήσω γὰρ μέγα τόξον Ὀδυσσῆος θείοιο· ὃς δέ κε ῥηΐτατʼ ἐντανύσῃ βιὸν ἐν παλάμῃσι καὶ διοϊστεύσῃ πελέκεων δυοκαίδεκα πάντων, τῷ κεν ἅμʼ ἑσποίμην, νοσφισσαμένη τόδε δῶμα κουρίδιον, μάλα καλόν, ἐνίπλειον βιότοιο, τοῦ ποτὲ μεμνήσεσθαι ὀΐομαι ἔν περ ὀνείρῳ.
"As she spoke, she told Eumaios to set the bow and the pieces of iron before the suitors, and Eumaios wept as he took them to do as she had bidden him. Hard by, the stockman wept also when he saw his master's bow, but Antinoos scolded them. ""You country louts,"" said he, ""silly simpletons; why should you add to the sorrows of your mistress by crying in this way? She has enough to grieve her in the loss of her husband; sit still, therefore, and eat your dinners in silence, or go outside if you want to cry, and leave the bow behind you. We suitors shall have to contend   for it with might and main, for we shall find it no light matter to string such a bow as this is. There is not a man of us all who is such another as Odysseus; for I have seen him and remember him, though I was then only a child."""	ὣς φάτο, καί ῥʼ Εὔμαιον ἀνώγει, δῖον ὑφορβόν, τόξον μνηστήρεσσι θέμεν πολιόν τε σίδηρον. δακρύσας δʼ Εὔμαιος ἐδέξατο καὶ κατέθηκε· κλαῖε δὲ βουκόλος ἄλλοθʼ, ἐπεὶ ἴδε τόξον ἄνακτος.

This was what he said, but all the time he was expecting to be able to string the bow and shoot through the iron, whereas in fact he was to be the first that should taste of the arrows from the hands of Odysseus, whom he was dishonoring in his own house - egging the others on to do so also.	ὣς φάτο, τῷ δʼ ἄρα θυμὸς ἐνὶ στήθεσσιν ἐώλπει νευρὴν ἐντανύσειν διοϊστεύσειν τε σιδήρου. ἦ τοι ὀϊστοῦ γε πρῶτος γεύσεσθαι ἔμελλεν ἐκ χειρῶν Ὀδυσῆος ἀμύμονος, ὃν τότʼ ἀτίμα ἥμενος ἐν μεγάροις, ἐπὶ δʼ ὤρνυε πάντας ἑταίρους.
"Then Telemakhos spoke. ""Great heavens!"" he exclaimed, ""Zeus must have robbed me of my senses. Here is my dear and excellent mother saying she will quit this house and marry again, yet I am laughing and enjoying myself as though there were nothing happening. But, suitors, as the contest   has been agreed upon, let it go forward. It is for a woman whose peer is not to be found in Pylos , Argos , or Mycenae , nor yet in Ithaca nor on the mainland. You know this as well as I do; what need have I to speak in praise   of my mother? Come on, then, make no excuses for delay, but let us see whether you can string the bow or no. I too will make trial of it, for if I can string it and shoot through the iron, I shall not suffer my mother to quit this house with a stranger, not if I can win the prizes which my father won before me."""	τοῖσι δὲ καὶ μετέειφʼ ἱερὴ ἲς Τηλεμάχοιο· ὢ πόποι, ἦ μάλα με Ζεὺς ἄφρονα θῆκε Κρονίων· μήτηρ μέν μοί φησι φίλη, πινυτή περ ἐοῦσα, ἄλλῳ ἅμʼ ἕψεσθαι νοσφισσαμένη τόδε δῶμα· αὐτὰρ ἐγὼ γελόω καὶ τέρπομαι ἄφρονι θυμῷ. ἀλλʼ ἄγετε, μνηστῆρες, ἐπεὶ τόδε φαίνετʼ ἄεθλον, οἵη νῦν οὐκ ἔστι γυνὴ κατʼ Ἀχαιΐδα γαῖαν, οὔτε Πύλου ἱερῆς οὔτʼ Ἄργεος οὔτε Μυκήνης· οὔτʼ αὐτῆς Ἰθάκης οὔτʼ ἠπείροιο μελαίνης· καὶ δʼ αὐτοὶ τόδε γʼ ἴστε· τί με χρὴ μητέρος αἴνου; ἀλλʼ ἄγε μὴ μύνῃσι παρέλκετε μηδʼ ἔτι τόξου δηρὸν ἀποτρωπᾶσθε τανυστύος, ὄφρα ἴδωμεν. καὶ δέ κεν αὐτὸς ἐγὼ τοῦ τόξου πειρησαίμην· εἰ δέ κεν ἐντανύσω διοϊστεύσω τε σιδήρου, οὔ κέ μοι ἀχνυμένῳ τάδε δώματα πότνια μήτηρ λείποι ἅμʼ ἄλλῳ ἰοῦσʼ, ὅτʼ ἐγὼ κατόπισθε λιποίμην οἷός τʼ ἤδη πατρὸς ἀέθλια κάλʼ ἀνελέσθαι.
As he spoke he sprang from his seat, threw his crimson cloak from him, and took his sword from his shoulder. First he set the axes in a row, in a long groove which he had dug for them, and had made straight by line. Then he stamped the earth tight round them, and everyone was surprised when they saw him set up so orderly, though he had never seen anything of the kind before. This done, he went on to the pavement to make trial of the bow; thrice did he tug at it, trying with all his might to draw the string, and thrice he had to rest his strength  , though he had hoped to string the bow and shoot through the iron. He was trying forcefully   for the fourth time, and would have strung it had not Odysseus made a sign to check him in spite of all his eagerness. So he said:	ἦ καὶ ἀπʼ ὤμοιϊν χλαῖναν θέτο φοινικόεσσαν ὀρθὸς ἀναΐξας, ἀπὸ δὲ ξίφος ὀξὺ θέτʼ ὤμων. πρῶτον μὲν πελέκεας στῆσεν, διὰ τάφρον ὀρύξας πᾶσι μίαν μακρήν, καὶ ἐπὶ στάθμην ἴθυνεν, ἀμφὶ δὲ γαῖαν ἔναξε· τάφος δʼ ἕλε πάντας ἰδόντας, ὡς εὐκόσμως στῆσε· πάρος δʼ οὐ πώ ποτʼ ὀπώπει. στῆ δʼ ἄρʼ ἐπʼ οὐδὸν ἰὼν καὶ τόξου πειρήτιζε. τρὶς μέν μιν πελέμιξεν ἐρύσσεσθαι μενεαίνων, τρὶς δὲ μεθῆκε βίης, ἐπιελπόμενος τό γε θυμῷ, νευρὴν ἐντανύειν διοϊστεύσειν τε σιδήρου. καί νύ κε δή ῥʼ ἐτάνυσσε βίῃ τὸ τέταρτον ἀνέλκων, ἀλλʼ Ὀδυσεὺς ἀνένευε καὶ ἔσχεθεν ἱέμενόν περ. τοῖς δʼ αὖτις μετέειφʼ ἱερὴ ἲς Τηλεμάχοιο·
"""Alas! I shall either be always feeble and of no prowess, or I am too young, and have not yet reached my full strength so as to be able to hold my own if any one attacks me. You others, therefore, who are stronger   than I, make trial of the bow and get this contest   settled."""	ὢ πόποι, ἦ καὶ ἔπειτα κακός τʼ ἔσομαι καὶ ἄκικυς, ἠὲ νεώτερός εἰμι καὶ οὔ πω χερσὶ πέποιθα ἄνδρʼ ἀπαμύνασθαι, ὅτε τις πρότερος χαλεπήνῃ. ἀλλʼ ἄγεθʼ, οἵ περ ἐμεῖο βίῃ προφερέστεροί ἐστε, τόξου πειρήσασθε, καὶ ἐκτελέωμεν ἄεθλον.
On this he put the bow down, letting it lean against the door that led into the house with the arrow standing against the top of the bow. Then he sat down on the seat from which he had risen, and Antinoos said:	ὣς εἰπὼν τόξον μὲν ἀπὸ ἕο θῆκε χαμᾶζε, κλίνας κολλητῇσιν ἐϋξέστῃς σανίδεσσιν, αὐτοῦ δʼ ὠκὺ βέλος καλῇ προσέκλινε κορώνῃ, ἂψ δʼ αὖτις κατʼ ἄρʼ ἕζετʼ ἐπὶ θρόνου ἔνθεν ἀνέστη. τοῖσιν δʼ Ἀντίνοος μετέφη, Εὐπείθεος υἱός·
"""Come on each of you in his turn, going towards the right from the place at which the cupbearer begins when he is handing round the wine."""	ὄρνυσθʼ ἑξείης ἐπιδέξια πάντες ἑταῖροι, ἀρξάμενοι τοῦ χώρου ὅθεν τέ περ οἰνοχοεύει.
"The rest agreed, and Leiodes son of Oinops was the first to rise. He was sacrificial priest to the suitors, and sat in the corner near the mixing-bowl. He was the only man to whom their evil deeds were hateful  and was indignant with the others. He was now the first to take the bow and arrow, so he went on to the pavement to make his trial, but he could not string the bow, for his hands were weak and unused to hard work, they therefore soon grew tired, and he said to the suitors, ""My friends, I cannot string it; let another have it; this bow shall take the life and soul   out of many a chief among us, for it is better to die than to live after having missed the prize that we have so long striven for, and which has brought us so long together. Some one of us is even now hoping and praying that he may marry Penelope, but when he has seen this bow and tried it, let him woo and make bridal offerings to some other woman, and let Penelope marry whoever makes her the best offer and whose lot it is to win her."""	ὣς ἔφατʼ Ἀντίνοος, τοῖσιν δʼ ἐπιήνδανε μῦθος. Λειώδης δὲ πρῶτος ἀνίστατο, Οἴνοπος υἱός, ὅ σφι θυοσκόος ἔσκε, παρὰ κρητῆρα δὲ καλὸν ἷζε μυχοίτατος αἰέν· ἀτασθαλίαι δέ οἱ οἴῳ ἐχθραὶ ἔσαν, πᾶσιν δὲ νεμέσσα μνηστήρεσσιν· ὅς ῥα τότε πρῶτος τόξον λάβε καὶ βέλος ὠκύ. στῆ δʼ ἄρʼ ἐπʼ οὐδὸν ἰὼν καὶ τόξου πειρήτιζεν, οὐδέ μιν ἐντάνυσε· πρὶν γὰρ κάμε χεῖρας ἀνέλκων ἀτρίπτους ἁπαλάς· μετὰ δὲ μνηστῆρσιν ἔειπεν· ὦ φίλοι, οὐ μὲν ἐγὼ τανύω, λαβέτω δὲ καὶ ἄλλος. πολλοὺς γὰρ τόδε τόξον ἀριστῆας κεκαδήσει θυμοῦ καὶ ψυχῆς, ἐπεὶ ἦ πολὺ φέρτερόν ἐστι τεθνάμεν ἢ ζώοντας ἁμαρτεῖν, οὗθʼ ἕνεκʼ αἰεὶ ἐνθάδʼ ὁμιλέομεν, ποτιδέγμενοι ἤματα πάντα. νῦν μέν τις καὶ ἔλπετʼ ἐνὶ φρεσὶν ἠδὲ μενοινᾷ γῆμαι Πηνελόπειαν, Ὀδυσσῆος παράκοιτιν. αὐτὰρ ἐπὴν τόξου πειρήσεται ἠδὲ ἴδηται, ἄλλην δή τινʼ ἔπειτα Ἀχαιϊάδων εὐπέπλων μνάσθω ἐέδνοισιν διζήμενος· ἡ δέ κʼ ἔπειτα γήμαιθʼ ὅς κε πλεῖστα πόροι καὶ μόρσιμος ἔλθοι.
On this he put the bow down, letting it lean against the door, with the arrow standing against the tip of the bow. Then he took his seat again on the seat from which he had risen; and Antinoos rebuked him saying:	ὣς ἄρʼ ἐφώνησεν καὶ ἀπὸ ἕο τόξον ἔθηκε, κλίνας κολλητῇσιν ἐϋξέστῃς σανίδεσσιν, αὐτοῦ δʼ ὠκὺ βέλος καλῇ προσέκλινε κορώνῃ, ἂψ δʼ αὖτις κατʼ ἄρ ἕζετʼ ἐπὶ θρόνου ἔνθεν ἀνέστη.
"""Leiodes, what are you talking about? Your words are monstrous and intolerable; it makes me angry to listen to you. Shall, then, this bow take the life   of many a chief among us, merely because you cannot bend it yourself? True, you were not born to be an archer, but there are others who will soon string it."""	Ἀντίνοος δʼ ἐνένιπεν ἔπος τʼ ἔφατʼ ἔκ τʼ ὀνόμαζε· Λειῶδες, ποῖόν σε ἔπος φύγεν ἕρκος ὀδόντων, δεινόν τʼ ἀργαλέον τε, —νεμεσσῶμαι δέ τʼ ἀκούων— εἰ δὴ τοῦτό γε τόξον ἀριστῆας κεκαδήσει θυμοῦ καὶ ψυχῆς, ἐπεὶ οὐ δύνασαι σὺ τανύσσαι. οὐ γάρ τοί σέ γε τοῖον ἐγείνατο πότνια μήτηρ οἷόν τε ῥυτῆρα βιοῦ τʼ ἔμεναι καὶ ὀϊστῶν· ἀλλʼ ἄλλοι τανύουσι τάχα μνηστῆρες ἀγαυοί.
"Then he said to Melanthios the goatherd, ""Look sharp, light a fire in the court, and set a seat hard by with a sheep skin on it; bring us also a large ball of lard, from what they have in the house. Let us warm the bow and grease it; we will then make trial of it again, and bring the contest   to an end."""	ὣς φάτο, καί ῥʼ ἐκέλευσε Μελάνθιον, αἰπόλον αἰγῶν· ἄγρει δή, πῦρ κῆον ἐνὶ μεγάροισι, Μελανθεῦ, πὰρ δὲ τίθει δίφρον τε μέγαν καὶ κῶας ἐπʼ αὐτοῦ, ἐκ δὲ στέατος ἔνεικε μέγαν τροχὸν ἔνδον ἐόντος, ὄφρα νέοι θάλποντες, ἐπιχρίοντες ἀλοιφῇ, τόξου πειρώμεσθα καὶ ἐκτελέωμεν ἄεθλον.
Melanthios lit the fire, and set a seat covered with sheep skins beside it. He also brought a great ball of lard from what they had in the house, and the suitors warmed the bow and again made trial of it, but they were none of them nearly strong   enough to string it. Nevertheless there still remained Antinoos and Eurymakhos, who were the ringleaders among the suitors and much the foremost in among them all.	ὣς φάθʼ, ὁ δʼ αἶψʼ ἀνέκαιε Μελάνθιος ἀκάματον πῦρ, πὰρ δὲ φέρων δίφρον θῆκεν καὶ κῶας ἐπʼ αὐτοῦ, ἐκ δὲ στέατος ἔνεικε μέγαν τροχὸν ἔνδον ἐόντος· τῷ ῥα νέοι θάλποντες ἐπειρῶντʼ· οὐδʼ ἐδύναντο ἐντανύσαι, πολλὸν δὲ βίης ἐπιδευέες ἦσαν. Ἀντίνοος δʼ ἔτʼ ἐπεῖχε καὶ Εὐρύμαχος θεοειδής, ἀρχοὶ μνηστήρων· ἀρετῇ δʼ ἔσαν ἔξοχʼ ἄριστοι.
Then the swineherd and the stockman left the cloisters together, and Odysseus followed them. When they had got outside the gates and the outer yard, Odysseus said to them quietly:	τὼ δʼ ἐξ οἴκου βῆσαν ὁμαρτήσαντες ἅμʼ ἄμφω βουκόλος ἠδὲ συφορβὸς Ὀδυσσῆος θείοιο· ἐκ δʼ αὐτὸς μετὰ τοὺς δόμου ἤλυθε δῖος Ὀδυσσεύς. ἀλλʼ ὅτε δή ῥʼ ἐκτὸς θυρέων ἔσαν ἠδὲ καὶ αὐλῆς, φθεγξάμενός σφε ἔπεσσι προσηύδα μειλιχίοισι·
"""Stockman, and you swineherd, I have something in my mind which I am in doubt whether to say or no; but I think I will say it. What manner of men would you be to stand by Odysseus, if some god should bring him back here all of a sudden? Say which you are disposed to do - to side with the suitors, or with Odysseus?"""	βουκόλε καὶ σύ, συφορβέ, ἔπος τί κε μυθησαίμην, ἦ αὐτὸς κεύθω; φάσθαι δέ με θυμὸς ἀνώγει. ποῖοί κʼ εἶτʼ Ὀδυσῆϊ ἀμυνέμεν, εἴ ποθεν ἔλθοι ὧδε μάλʼ ἐξαπίνης καί τις θεὸς αὐτὸν ἐνείκαι; ἤ κε μνηστήρεσσιν ἀμύνοιτʼ ἦ Ὀδυσῆϊ; εἴπαθʼ ὅπως ὑμέας κραδίη θυμός τε κελεύει.
"""Father Zeus,"" answered the stockman, ""would indeed that you might so ordain it. If some were but to bring Odysseus back, you should see with what might and main I would fight for him."""	τὸν δʼ αὖτε προσέειπε βοῶν ἐπιβουκόλος ἀνήρ· Ζεῦ πάτερ, αἲ γὰρ τοῦτο τελευτήσειας ἐέλδωρ, ὡς ἔλθοι μὲν κεῖνος ἀνήρ, ἀγάγοι δέ ἑ δαίμων· γνοίης χʼ οἵη ἐμὴ δύναμις καὶ χεῖρες ἕπονται.
"In like words Eumaios prayed to all the gods that Odysseus might return; when, therefore, he saw for certain what mind   they were of, Odysseus said, ""It is I, Odysseus, who am here. I have suffered much, but at last, in the twentieth year, I am come back to my own country. I find that you two alone of all my servants are glad that I should do so, for I have not heard any of the others praying for my return. To you two, therefore, will I unfold the truth   as it shall be. If heaven shall deliver the suitors into my hands, I will find wives for both of you, will give you house and holding close to my own, and you shall be to me as though you were brothers and friends of Telemakhos. I will now give you a convincing proof   that you may know me and be assured. See, here is the scar from the boar's tooth that ripped me when I was out hunting on Mount Parnassus with the sons of Autolykos."""	ὣς δʼ αὔτως Εὔμαιος ἐπεύχετο πᾶσι θεοῖσι νοστῆσαι Ὀδυσῆα πολύφρονα ὅνδε δόμονδε. αὐτὰρ ἐπεὶ δὴ τῶν γε νόον νημερτέʼ ἀνέγνω, ἐξαῦτίς σφε ἔπεσσιν ἀμειβόμενος προσέειπεν· ἔνδον μὲν δὴ ὅδʼ αὐτὸς ἐγώ, κακὰ πολλὰ μογήσας ἤλυθον εἰκοστῷ ἔτεϊ ἐς πατρίδα γαῖαν. γιγνώσκω δʼ ὡς σφῶϊν ἐελδομένοισιν ἱκάνω οἴοισι δμώων· τῶν δʼ ἄλλων οὔ τευ ἄκουσα εὐξαμένου ἐμὲ αὖτις ὑπότροπον οἴκαδʼ ἱκέσθαι. σφῶϊν δʼ, ὡς ἔσεταί περ, ἀληθείην καταλέξω. εἴ χʼ ὑπʼ ἐμοί γε θεὸς δαμάσῃ μνηστῆρας ἀγαυούς, ἄξομαι ἀμφοτέροις ἀλόχους καὶ κτήματʼ ὀπάσσω οἰκία τʼ ἐγγὺς ἐμεῖο τετυγμένα· καί μοι ἔπειτα Τηλεμάχου ἑτάρω τε κασιγνήτω τε ἔσεσθον. εἰ δʼ ἄγε δή, καὶ σῆμα ἀριφραδὲς ἄλλο τι δείξω, ὄφρα μʼ ἐῢ γνῶτον πιστωθῆτόν τʼ ἐνὶ θυμῷ, οὐλήν, τήν ποτέ με σῦς ἤλασε λευκῷ ὀδόντι Παρνησόνδʼ ἐλθόντα σὺν υἱάσιν Αὐτολύκοιο.
As he spoke he drew his rags aside from the great scar, and when they had examined it thoroughly, they both of them wept about Odysseus, threw their arms round him and kissed his head and shoulders, while Odysseus kissed their hands and faces in return. The sun would have gone down upon their mourning if Odysseus had not checked them and said:	ὣς εἰπὼν ῥάκεα μεγάλης ἀποέργαθεν οὐλῆς. τὼ δʼ ἐπεὶ εἰσιδέτην εὖ τʼ ἐφράσσαντο ἕκαστα, κλαῖον ἄρʼ ἀμφʼ Ὀδυσῆϊ δαΐφρονι χεῖρε βαλόντε, καὶ κύνεον ἀγαπαζόμενοι κεφαλήν τε καὶ ὤμους ὣς δʼ αὔτως Ὀδυσεὺς κεφαλὰς καὶ χεῖρας ἔκυσσε. καί νύ κʼ ὀδυρομένοισιν ἔδυ φάος ἠελίοιο, εἰ μὴ Ὀδυσσεὺς αὐτὸς ἐρύκακε φώνησέν τε·
"""Cease your weeping, lest some one should come outside and see us, and tell those who are within. When you go in, do so separately, not both together; I will go first, and do you follow afterwards; Let this moreover be the sign   between us; the suitors will all of them try to prevent me from getting hold of the bow and quiver; do you, therefore, Eumaios, place it in my hands when you are carrying it about, and tell the women to close the doors of their apartment. If they hear any groaning or uproar as of men fighting about the house, they must not come out; they must keep quiet, and stay where they are at their work. And I charge you, Philoitios, to make fast the doors of the outer court, and to bind them securely at once."""	παύεσθον κλαυθμοῖο γόοιό τε, μή τις ἴδηται ἐξελθὼν μεγάροιο, ἀτὰρ εἴπῃσι καὶ εἴσω. ἀλλὰ προμνηστῖνοι ἐσέλθετε, μηδʼ ἅμα πάντες, πρῶτος ἐγώ, μετὰ δʼ ὔμμες· ἀτὰρ τόδε σῆμα τετύχθω· ἄλλοι μὲν γὰρ πάντες, ὅσοι μνηστῆρες ἀγαυοί, οὐκ ἐάσουσιν ἐμοὶ δόμεναι βιὸν ἠδὲ φαρέτρην· ἀλλὰ σύ, δῖʼ Εὔμαιε, φέρων ἀνὰ δώματα τόξον ἐν χείρεσσιν ἐμοὶ θέμεναι, εἰπεῖν τε γυναιξὶ κληῗσαι μεγάροιο θύρας πυκινῶς ἀραρυίας, ἢν δέ τις ἢ στοναχῆς ἠὲ κτύπου ἔνδον ἀκούσῃ ἀνδρῶν ἡμετέροισιν ἐν ἕρκεσι, μή τι θύραζε προβλώσκειν, ἀλλʼ αὐτοῦ ἀκὴν ἔμεναι παρὰ ἔργῳ. σοὶ δέ, Φιλοίτιε δῖε, θύρας ἐπιτέλλομαι αὐλῆς κληῗσαι κληῗδι, θοῶς δʼ ἐπὶ δεσμὸν ἰῆλαι.
When he had thus spoken, he went back to the house and took the seat that he had left. Presently, his two servants followed him inside.	ὣς εἰπὼν εἰσῆλθε δόμους εὖ ναιετάοντας· ἕζετʼ ἔπειτʼ ἐπὶ δίφρον ἰών, ἔνθεν περ ἀνέστη· ἐς δʼ ἄρα καὶ τὼ δμῶε ἴτην θείου Ὀδυσῆος.
"At this moment the bow was in the hands of Eurymakhos, who was warming it by the fire, but even so he could not string it, and he was greatly grieved. He heaved a deep sigh and said, ""I grieve   for myself and for us all; I grieve that I shall have to forgo the marriage, but I do not care nearly so much about this, for there are plenty of other women in Ithaca and elsewhere; what I feel most is the fact of our being so inferior to Odysseus in strength   that we cannot string his bow. This will disgrace us in the eyes of those who are yet unborn."""

"""It shall not be so, Eurymakhos,"" said Antinoos, ""and you know it yourself. To-day is the feast of Apollo throughout all the ; who can string a bow on such a day as this? Put it on one side - as for the axes they can stay where they are, for no one is likely to come to the house and take them away: let the cupbearer go round with his cups, that we may make our drink-offerings and drop this matter of the bow; we will tell Melanthios to bring us in some goats tomorrow - the best he has; we can then offer thigh bones to Apollo the mighty archer, and again make trial of the bow, so as to bring the contest   to an end."""	τὸν δʼ αὖτʼ Ἀντίνοος προσέφη, Εὐπείθεος υἱός· Εὐρύμαχʼ, οὐχ οὕτως ἔσται· νοέεις δὲ καὶ αὐτός. νῦν μὲν γὰρ κατὰ δῆμον ἑορτὴ τοῖο θεοῖο ἁγνή· τίς δέ κε τόξα τιταίνοιτʼ; ἀλλὰ ἕκηλοι κάτθετʼ· ἀτὰρ πελέκεάς γε καὶ εἴ κʼ εἰῶμεν ἅπαντας ἑστάμεν· οὐ μὲν γάρ τινʼ ἀναιρήσεσθαι ὀΐω, ἐλθόντʼ ἐς μέγαρον Λαερτιάδεω Ὀδυσῆος. ἀλλʼ ἄγετʼ, οἰνοχόος μὲν ἐπαρξάσθω δεπάεσσιν, ὄφρα σπείσαντες καταθείομεν ἀγκύλα τόξα· ἠῶθεν δὲ κέλεσθε Μελάνθιον, αἰπόλον αἰγῶν, αἶγας ἄγειν, αἳ πᾶσι μέγʼ ἔξοχοι αἰπολίοισιν, ὄφρʼ ἐπὶ μηρία θέντες Ἀπόλλωνι κλυτοτόξῳ τόξου πειρώμεσθα καὶ ἐκτελέωμεν ἄεθλον.
The rest approved his words, and thereon men servants poured water over the hands of the guests, while pages filled the mixing-bowls with wine and water and handed it round after giving every man his drink-offering. Then, when they had made their offerings and had drunk each as much as he desired, Odysseus craftily said:	ὣς ἔφατʼ Ἀντίνοος, τοῖσιν δʼ ἐπιήνδανε μῦθος. τοῖσι δὲ κήρυκες μὲν ὕδωρ ἐπὶ χεῖρας ἔχευαν, κοῦροι δὲ κρητῆρας ἐπεστέψαντο ποτοῖο, νώμησαν δʼ ἄρα πᾶσιν ἐπαρξάμενοι δεπάεσσιν. οἱ δʼ ἐπεὶ οὖν σπεῖσάν τʼ ἔπιόν θʼ ὅσον ἤθελε θυμός, τοῖς δὲ δολοφρονέων μετέφη πολύμητις Ὀδυσσεύς·
"""Suitors of the illustrious queen, listen that I may speak even as I am minded. I appeal more especially to Eurymakhos, and to Antinoos who has just spoken with so much reason. Cease shooting for the present and leave the matter to the gods, but in the morning let heaven give victory to whom it will. For the moment, however, give me the bow that I may prove the power of my hands among you all, and see whether I still have as much strength as I used to have, or whether travel and neglect have made an end of it."""	κέκλυτέ μευ, μνηστῆρες ἀγακλειτῆς βασιλείης· ὄφρʼ εἴπω τά με θυμὸς ἐνὶ στήθεσσι κελεύει· Εὐρύμαχον δὲ μάλιστα καὶ Ἀντίνοον θεοειδέα λίσσομʼ, ἐπεὶ καὶ τοῦτο ἔπος κατὰ μοῖραν ἔειπε, νῦν μὲν παῦσαι τόξον, ἐπιτρέψαι δὲ θεοῖσιν· ἠῶθεν δὲ θεὸς δώσει κράτος ᾧ κʼ ἐθέλῃσιν. ἀλλʼ ἄγʼ ἐμοὶ δότε τόξον ἐΰξοον, ὄφρα μεθʼ ὑμῖν χειρῶν καὶ σθένεος πειρήσομαι, ἤ μοι ἔτʼ ἐστὶν ἴς, οἵη πάρος ἔσκεν ἐνὶ γναμπτοῖσι μέλεσσιν, ἦ ἤδη μοι ὄλεσσεν ἄλη τʼ ἀκομιστίη τε.
"This made them all very angry, for they feared he might string the bow; Antinoos therefore rebuked him fiercely saying, ""Wretched creature, you have not so much as a grain of sense in your whole body; you ought to think yourself lucky in being allowed to dine unharmed among your betters, without having any smaller portion served you than we others have had, and in being allowed to hear our conversation. No other beggar or stranger has been allowed to hear what we say among ourselves; the wine must have been doing you a mischief, as it does with all those drink immoderately. It was wine that inflamed the Centaur Eurytion when he was staying with Peirithoos among the Lapiths. When the wine had got into his head he went mad and did ill deeds about the house of Peirithoos; this grieved   the heroes who were there assembled, so they rushed at him and cut off his ears and nostrils; then they dragged him through the doorway out of the house, so he went away crazed, and bore the burden   of his crime, bereft of understanding. Henceforth, therefore, there was war between humankind and the centaurs, but he brought it upon himself through his own drunkenness. In like manner I can tell you that it will go hardly with you if you string the bow: you will find no mercy from any one in our , for we shall at once ship you off to king Echetos, who kills every one that comes near him: you will never get away alive, so drink and keep quiet without getting into a quarrel with men younger than yourself."""	ὣς ἔφαθʼ, οἱ δʼ ἄρα πάντες ὑπερφιάλως νεμέσησαν, δείσαντες μὴ τόξον ἐΰξοον ἐντανύσειεν. Ἀντίνοος δʼ ἐνένιπεν ἔπος τʼ ἔφατʼ ἔκ τʼ ὀνόμαζεν· ἆ δειλὲ ξείνων, ἔνι τοι φρένες οὐδʼ ἠβαιαί· οὐκ ἀγαπᾷς ὃ ἕκηλος ὑπερφιάλοισι μεθʼ ἡμῖν δαίνυσαι, οὐδέ τι δαιτὸς ἀμέρδεαι, αὐτὰρ ἀκούεις μύθων ἡμετέρων καὶ ῥήσιος; οὐδέ τις ἄλλος ἡμετέρων μύθων ξεῖνος καὶ πτωχὸς ἀκούει. οἶνός σε τρώει μελιηδής, ὅς τε καὶ ἄλλους βλάπτει, ὃς ἄν μιν χανδὸν ἕλῃ μηδʼ αἴσιμα πίνῃ. οἶνος καὶ Κένταυρον, ἀγακλυτὸν Εὐρυτίωνα, ἄασʼ ἐνὶ μεγάρῳ μεγαθύμου Πειριθόοιο, ἐς Λαπίθας ἐλθόνθʼ· ὁ δʼ ἐπεὶ φρένας ἄασεν οἴνῳ, μαινόμενος κάκʼ ἔρεξε δόμον κάτα Πειριθόοιο· ἥρωας δʼ ἄχος εἷλε, διὲκ προθύρου δὲ θύραζε ἕλκον ἀναΐξαντες, ἀπʼ οὔατα νηλέϊ χαλκῷ ῥῖνάς τʼ ἀμήσαντες· ὁ δὲ φρεσὶν ᾗσιν ἀασθεὶς ἤϊεν ἣν ἄτην ὀχέων ἀεσίφρονι θυμῷ. ἐξ οὗ Κενταύροισι καὶ ἀνδράσι νεῖκος ἐτύχθη, οἷ δʼ αὐτῷ πρώτῳ κακὸν εὕρετο οἰνοβαρείων. ὣς καὶ σοὶ μέγα πῆμα πιφαύσκομαι, αἴ κε τὸ τόξον ἐντανύσῃς· οὐ γάρ τευ ἐπητύος ἀντιβολήσεις ἡμετέρῳ ἐνὶ δήμῳ, ἄφαρ δέ σε νηῒ μελαίνῃ εἰς Ἔχετον βασιλῆα, βροτῶν δηλήμονα πάντων, πέμψομεν· ἔνθεν δʼ οὔ τι σαώσεαι· ἀλλὰ ἕκηλος πῖνέ τε, μηδʼ ἐρίδαινε μετʼ ἀνδράσι κουροτέροισιν.
"Penelope then spoke to him. ""Antinoos,"" said she, ""it is not right   that you should ill-treat any guest of Telemakhos who comes to this house. If the stranger should prove strong   enough to string the mighty bow of Odysseus, can you suppose that he would take me home with him and make me his wife? Even the man himself can have no such idea in his mind: none of you need let that disturb his feasting; it would be out of all reason."""	τὸν δʼ αὖτε προσέειπε περίφρων Πηνελόπεια· Ἀντίνοʼ, οὐ μὲν καλὸν ἀτέμβειν οὐδὲ δίκαιον ξείνους Τηλεμάχου, ὅς κεν τάδε δώμαθʼ ἵκηται· ἔλπεαι, αἴ χʼ ὁ ξεῖνος Ὀδυσσῆος μέγα τόξον ἐντανύσῃ χερσίν τε βίηφί τε ἧφι πιθήσας, οἴκαδέ μʼ ἄξεσθαι καὶ ἑὴν θήσεσθαι ἄκοιτιν; οὐδʼ αὐτός που τοῦτό γʼ ἐνὶ στήθεσσιν ἔολπε· μηδέ τις ὑμείων τοῦ γʼ εἵνεκα θυμὸν ἀχεύων ἐνθάδε δαινύσθω, ἐπεὶ οὐδὲ μὲν οὐδὲ ἔοικεν.
"""Queen Penelope,"" answered Eurymakhos, ""we do not suppose that this man will take you away with him; it is impossible; but we are afraid lest some of the baser sort, men or women among the Achaeans, should go gossiping about and say, ‘These suitors are a feeble folk; they are paying court to the wife of a brave man whose bow not one of them was able to string, and yet a beggarly tramp who came to the house strung it at once and sent an arrow through the iron.’ This is what will be said, and it will be a scandal against us."""	τὴν δʼ αὖτʼ Εὐρύμαχος, Πολύβου πάϊς, ἀντίον ηὔδα· κούρη Ἰκαρίοιο, περίφρον Πηνελόπεια, οὔ τί σε τόνδʼ ἄξεσθαι ὀϊόμεθʼ· οὐδὲ ἔοικεν· ἀλλʼ αἰσχυνόμενοι φάτιν ἀνδρῶν ἠδὲ γυναικῶν, μή ποτέ τις εἴπῃσι κακώτερος ἄλλος Ἀχαιῶν ἦ πολὺ χείρονες ἄνδρες ἀμύμονος ἀνδρὸς ἄκοιτιν μνῶνται, οὐδέ τι τόξον ἐΰξοον ἐντανύουσιν· ἀλλʼ ἄλλος τις πτωχὸς ἀνὴρ ἀλαλήμενος ἐλθὼν ῥηϊδίως ἐτάνυσσε βιόν, διὰ δʼ ἧκε σιδήρου. ὣς ἐρέουσʼ, ἡμῖν δʼ ἂν ἐλέγχεα ταῦτα γένοιτο.
"""Eurymakhos,"" Penelope answered, ""people who persist in eating up the estate of a great chieftain and dishonoring his house must not expect others in the to think well of them. Why then should you mind if men talk as you think they will? This stranger is strong and well-built, he says moreover that he is of noble birth. Give him the bow, and let us see whether he can string it or no. I say - and it shall surely be - that if Apollo grants him the glory of stringing it, I will give him a cloak and shirt of good wear, with a javelin to keep off dogs and robbers, and a sharp sword. I will also give him sandals, and will see him sent safely wherever he wants to go."""	τὸν δʼ αὖτε προσέειπε περίφρων Πηνελόπεια· Εὐρύμαχʼ, οὔ πως ἔστιν ἐϋκλεῖας κατὰ δῆμον ἔμμεναι οἳ δὴ οἶκον ἀτιμάζοντες ἔδουσιν ἀνδρὸς ἀριστῆος· τί δʼ ἐλέγχεα ταῦτα τίθεσθε; οὗτος δὲ ξεῖνος μάλα μὲν μέγας ἠδʼ εὐπηγής, πατρὸς δʼ ἐξ ἀγαθοῦ γένος εὔχεται ἔμμεναι υἱός. ἀλλʼ ἄγε οἱ δότε τόξον ἐΰξοον, ὄφρα ἴδωμεν. ὧδε γὰρ ἐξερέω, τὸ δὲ καὶ τετελεσμένον ἔσται· εἴ κέ μιν ἐντανύσῃ, δώῃ δέ οἱ εὖχος Ἀπόλλων, ἕσσω μιν χλαῖνάν τε χιτῶνά τε, εἵματα καλά, δώσω δʼ ὀξὺν ἄκοντα, κυνῶν ἀλκτῆρα καὶ ἀνδρῶν, καὶ ξίφος ἄμφηκες· δώσω δʼ ὑπὸ ποσσὶ πέδιλα, πέμψω δʼ ὅππη μιν κραδίη θυμός τε κελεύει.
"Then Telemakhos said, ""Mother, I am the only man either in Ithaca or in the islands that are over against Elis who has the right to let any one have the bow or to refuse it. No one shall force me one way or the other, not even though I choose to make the stranger a present of the bow outright, and let him take it away with him. Go, then, within the house and busy yourself with your daily duties, your loom, your distaff, and the ordering of your servants. This bow is a man's matter, and mine above all others, for it is I who am master here."""	τὴν δʼ αὖ Τηλέμαχος πεπνυμένος ἀντίον ηὔδα· μῆτερ ἐμή, τόξον μὲν Ἀχαιῶν οὔ τις ἐμεῖο κρείσσων, ᾧ κʼ ἐθέλω, δόμεναί τε καὶ ἀρνήσασθαι, οὔθʼ ὅσσοι κραναὴν Ἰθάκην κάτα κοιρανέουσιν, οὔθʼ ὅσσοι νήσοισι πρὸς Ἤλιδος ἱπποβότοιο· τῶν οὔ τίς μʼ ἀέκοντα βιήσεται, αἴ κʼ ἐθέλωμι καὶ καθάπαξ ξείνῳ δόμεναι τάδε τόξα φέρεσθαι. ἀλλʼ εἰς οἶκον ἰοῦσα τὰ σʼ αὐτῆς ἔργα κόμιζε, ἱστόν τʼ ἠλακάτην τε, καὶ ἀμφιπόλοισι κέλευε ἔργον ἐποίχεσθαι· τόξον δʼ ἄνδρεσσι μελήσει πᾶσι, μάλιστα δʼ ἐμοί· τοῦ γὰρ κράτος ἔστʼ ἐνὶ οἴκῳ.
She went wondering back into the house, and laid her son's saying in her heart. Then going upstairs with her handmaids into her room, she mourned her dear husband till Athena sent sweet sleep over her eyelids.	ἡ μὲν θαμβήσασα πάλιν οἶκόνδε βεβήκει· παιδὸς γὰρ μῦθον πεπνυμένον ἔνθετο θυμῷ. ἐς δʼ ὑπερῷʼ ἀναβᾶσα σὺν ἀμφιπόλοισι γυναιξὶ κλαῖεν ἔπειτʼ Ὀδυσῆα, φίλον πόσιν, ὄφρα οἱ ὕπνον ἡδὺν ἐπὶ βλεφάροισι βάλε γλαυκῶπις Ἀθήνη.
"The swineherd now took up the bow and was for taking it to Odysseus, but the suitors clamored at him from all parts of the cloisters, and one of them said, ""You idiot, where are you taking the bow to? Are you out of your wits? If Apollo and the other gods will answer our prayer, your own boarhounds shall get you into some quiet little place, and worry you to death."""	αὐτὰρ ὁ τόξα λαβὼν φέρε καμπύλα δῖος ὑφορβός· μνηστῆρες δʼ ἄρα πάντες ὁμόκλεον ἐν μεγάροισιν· ὧδε δέ τις εἴπεσκε νέων ὑπερηνορεόντων· πῆ δὴ καμπύλα τόξα φέρεις, ἀμέγαρτε συβῶτα, πλαγκτέ; τάχʼ αὖ σʼ ἐφʼ ὕεσσι κύνες ταχέες κατέδονται οἶον ἀπʼ ἀνθρώπων, οὓς ἔτρεφες, εἴ κεν Ἀπόλλων ἡμῖν ἱλήκῃσι καὶ ἀθάνατοι θεοὶ ἄλλοι.
"Eumaios was frightened at the outcry they all raised, so he put the bow down then and there, but Telemakhos shouted out at him from the other side of the cloisters, and threatened him saying, ""Father Eumaios, bring the bow on in spite of them, or young as I am I will pelt you with stones back to the country, for I am the stronger   man of the two. I wish I was as much stronger than all the other suitors in the house as I am than you, I would soon send some of them off sick and sorry, for they mean mischief."""	ὣς φάσαν, αὐτὰρ, ὁ θῆκε φέρων αὐτῇ ἐνὶ χώρῃ, δείσας, οὕνεκα πολλοὶ ὁμόκλεον ἐν μεγάροισιν. Τηλέμαχος δʼ ἑτέρωθεν ἀπειλήσας ἐγεγώνει· ἄττα, πρόσω φέρε τόξα· τάχʼ οὐκ εὖ πᾶσι πιθήσεις μή σε καὶ ὁπλότερός περ ἐὼν ἀγρόνδε δίωμαι, βάλλων χερμαδίοισι· βίηφι δὲ φέρτερός εἰμι. αἲ γὰρ πάντων τόσσον, ὅσοι κατὰ δώματʼ ἔασι, μνηστήρων χερσίν τε βίηφί τε φέρτερος εἴην· τῷ κε τάχα στυγερῶς τινʼ ἐγὼ πέμψαιμι νέεσθαι ἡμετέρου ἐξ οἴκου, ἐπεὶ κακὰ μηχανόωνται.
"Thus did he speak, and they all of them laughed heartily, which put them in a better humor with Telemakhos; so Eumaios brought the bow on and placed it in the hands of Odysseus. When he had done this, he called Eurykleia apart and said to her, ""Eurykleia, Telemakhos says you are to close the doors of the women's apartments. If they hear any groaning or uproar as of men fighting about the house, they are not to come out, but are to keep quiet and stay where they are at their work."""	ὣς ἔφαθʼ, οἱ δʼ ἄρα πάντες ἐπʼ αὐτῷ ἡδὺ γέλασσαν μνηστῆρες, καὶ δὴ μέθιεν χαλεποῖο χόλοιο Τηλεμάχῳ· τὰ δὲ τόξα φέρων ἀνὰ δῶμα συβώτης ἐν χείρεσσʼ Ὀδυσῆϊ δαΐφρονι θῆκε παραστάς. ἐκ δὲ καλεσσάμενος προσέφη τροφὸν Εὐρύκλειαν· Τηλέμαχος κέλεταί σε, περίφρων Εὐρύκλεια, κληῗσαι μεγάροιο θύρας πυκινῶς ἀραρυίας. ἢν δέ τις ἤ στοναχῆς ἠὲ κτύπου ἔνδον ἀκούσῃ ἀνδρῶν ἡμετέροισιν ἐν ἕρκεσι, μή τι θύραζε προβλώσκειν, ἀλλʼ αὐτοῦ ἀκὴν ἔμεναι παρὰ ἔργῳ.
Eurykleia did as she was told and closed the doors of the women's apartments.	ὣς ἄρʼ ἐφώνησεν, τῇ δʼ ἄπτερος ἔπλετο μῦθος, κλήϊσεν δὲ θύρας μεγάρων εὖ ναιεταόντων.
"Meanwhile Philoitios slipped quietly out and made fast the gates of the outer court. There was a ship's cable of papyrus fiber lying in the gatehouse, so he made the gates fast with it and then came in again, resuming the seat that he had left, and keeping an eye on Odysseus, who had now got the bow in his hands, and was turning it every way about, and proving it all over to see whether the worms had been eating into its two horns during his absence. Then would one turn towards his neighbor saying, ""This is some tricky old bow-fancier; either he has got one like it at home, or he wants to make one, in such workmanlike style does the old vagabond handle it."""	σιγῇ δʼ ἐξ οἴκοιο Φιλοίτιος ἆλτο θύραζε, κλήϊσεν δʼ ἄρʼ ἔπειτα θύρας εὐερκέος αὐλῆς. κεῖτο δʼ ὑπʼ αἰθούσῃ ὅπλον νεὸς ἀμφιελίσσης βύβλινον, ᾧ ῥʼ ἐπέδησε θύρας, ἐς δʼ ἤϊεν αὐτός· ἕζετʼ ἔπειτʼ ἐπὶ δίφρον ἰών, ἔνθεν περ ἀνέστη, εἰσορόων Ὀδυσῆα. ὁ δʼ ἤδη τόξον ἐνώμα πάντη ἀναστρωφῶν, πειρώμενος ἔνθα καὶ ἔνθα, μὴ κέρα ἶπες ἔδοιεν ἀποιχομένοιο ἄνακτος. ὧδε τις εἴπεσκεν ἰδὼν ἐς πλησίον ἄλλον· ἦ τις θηητὴρ καὶ ἐπίκλοπος ἔπλετο τόξων· ἤ ῥά νύ που τοιαῦτα καὶ αὐτῷ οἴκοθι κεῖται ἢ ὅ γʼ ἐφορμᾶται ποιησέμεν, ὡς ἐνὶ χερσὶ νωμᾷ ἔνθα καὶ ἔνθα κακῶν ἔμπαιος ἀλήτης.
"Another said, ""I hope he may be no more successful in other things than he is likely to be in stringing this bow."""	ἄλλος δʼ αὖ εἴπεσκε νέων ὑπερηνορεόντων· αἲ γὰρ δὴ τοσσοῦτον ὀνήσιος ἀντιάσειεν ὡς οὗτός ποτε τοῦτο δυνήσεται ἐντανύσασθαι.
But Odysseus, when he had taken it up and examined it all over, strung it as easily as a skilled bard strings a new peg of his lyre and makes the twisted gut fast at both ends. Then he took it in his right hand to prove the string, and it sang sweetly under his touch like the twittering of a swallow. The suitors were dismayed  , and turned color as they heard it; at that moment, moreover, Zeus thundered loudly as a sign  , and the heart of Odysseus rejoiced as he heard the omen that the son of scheming Kronos had sent him.	ὣς ἄρʼ ἔφαν μνηστῆρες· ἀτὰρ πολύμητις Ὀδυσσεύς, αὐτίκʼ ἐπεὶ μέγα τόξον ἐβάστασε καὶ ἴδε πάντη, ὡς ὅτʼ ἀνὴρ φόρμιγγος ἐπιστάμενος καὶ ἀοιδῆς ῥηϊδίως ἐτάνυσσε νέῳ περὶ κόλλοπι χορδήν, ἅψας ἀμφοτέρωθεν ἐϋστρεφὲς ἔντερον οἰός, ὣς ἄρʼ ἄτερ σπουδῆς τάνυσεν μέγα τόξον Ὀδυσσεύς. δεξιτερῇ ἄρα χειρὶ λαβὼν πειρήσατο νευρῆς· ἡ δʼ ὑπὸ καλὸν ἄεισε, χελιδόνι εἰκέλη αὐδήν. μνηστῆρσιν δʼ ἄρʼ ἄχος γένετο μέγα, πᾶσι δʼ ἄρα χρὼς ἐτράπετο· Ζεὺς δὲ μεγάλʼ ἔκτυπε σήματα φαίνων· γήθησέν τʼ ἄρʼ ἔπειτα πολύτλας δῖος Ὀδυσσεύς. ὅττι ῥά οἱ τέρας ἧκε Κρόνου πάϊς ἀγκυλομήτεω·
He took an arrow that was lying upon the table - for those which the Achaeans were so shortly about to taste were all inside the quiver - he laid it on the center-piece of the bow, and drew the notch of the arrow and the string toward him, still seated on his seat. When he had taken aim he let fly, and his arrow pierced every one of the handle-holes of the axes from the first onwards till it had gone right through them, and into the outer courtyard. Then he said to Telemakhos:	εἵλετο δʼ ὠκὺν ὀϊστόν, ὅ οἱ παρέκειτο τραπέζῃ γυμνός· τοὶ δʼ ἄλλοι κοίλης ἔντοσθε φαρέτρης κείατο, τῶν τάχʼ ἔμελλον Ἀχαιοὶ πειρήσεσθαι. τόν ῥʼ ἐπὶ πήχει ἑλὼν ἕλκεν νευρὴν γλυφίδας τε, αὐτόθεν ἐκ δίφροιο καθήμενος, ἧκε δʼ ὀϊστὸν ἄντα τιτυσκόμενος, πελέκεων δʼ οὐκ ἤμβροτε πάντων πρώτης στειλειῆς, διὰ δʼ ἀμπερὲς ἦλθε θύραζε ἰὸς χαλκοβαρής· ὁ δὲ Τηλέμαχον προσέειπε· Τηλέμαχʼ, οὔ σʼ ὁ ξεῖνος ἐνὶ μεγάροισιν ἐλέγχει
"""Your guest has not disgraced you, Telemakhos. I did not miss what I aimed at, and I was not long in stringing my bow. I am still strong, and not as the suitors mock me for being. Now, however, it is time   for the Achaeans to prepare supper while there is still daylight, and then otherwise to disport themselves with song and dance which are the crowning ornaments of a banquet."""	ἥμενος, οὐδέ τι τοῦ σκοποῦ ἤμβροτον οὐδέ τι τόξον δὴν ἔκαμον τανύων· ἔτι μοι μένος ἔμπεδόν ἐστιν, οὐχ ὥς με μνηστῆρες ἀτιμάζοντες ὄνονται. νῦν δʼ ὥρη καὶ δόρπον Ἀχαιοῖσιν τετυκέσθαι ἐν φάει, αὐτὰρ ἔπειτα καὶ ἄλλως ἑψιάασθαι μολπῇ καὶ φόρμιγγι· τὰ γάρ τʼ ἀναθήματα δαιτός.
As he spoke he made a sign with his eyebrows, and Telemakhos girded on his sword, grasped his spear, and stood armed beside his father's seat.	ἦ καὶ ἐπʼ ὀφρύσι νεῦσεν· ὁ δʼ ἀμφέθετο ξίφος ὀξὺ Τηλέμαχος, φίλος υἱὸς Ὀδυσσῆος θείοιο, ἀμφὶ δὲ χεῖρα φίλην βάλεν ἔγχεϊ, ἄγχι δʼ ἄρʼ αὐτοῦ
"Then Odysseus tore off his rags, and sprang on to the broad pavement with his bow and his quiver full of arrows. He shed the arrows on to the ground at his feet and said, ""The mighty contest   is at an end. I will now see whether Apollo will grant it to me to hit another mark which no man has yet hit."""	αὐτὰρ ὁ γυμνώθη ῥακέων πολύμητις Ὀδυσσεύς, ἆλτο δʼ ἐπὶ μέγαν οὐδόν, ἔχων βιὸν ἠδὲ φαρέτρην ἰῶν ἐμπλείην, ταχέας δʼ ἐκχεύατʼ ὀϊστοὺς αὐτοῦ πρόσθε ποδῶν, μετὰ δὲ μνηστῆρσιν ἔειπεν· οὗτος μὲν δὴ ἄεθλος ἀάατος ἐκτετέλεσται· νῦν αὖτε σκοπὸν ἄλλον, ὃν οὔ πώ τις βάλεν ἀνήρ, εἴσομαι, αἴ κε τύχωμι, πόρῃ δέ μοι εὖχος Ἀπόλλων.
"On this he aimed a deadly arrow at Antinoos, who was about to take up a two-handled gold cup to drink his wine and already had it in his hands. He had no thought of death - who amongst all the revelers would think that one man, however brave, would stand alone among so many and kill him? The arrow struck Antinoos in the throat, and the point went clean through his neck, so that he fell over and the cup dropped from his hand, while a thick stream of blood gushed from his nostrils. He kicked the table from him and upset the things on it, so that the bread and roasted meats were all soiled as they fell over on to the ground. The suitors were in an uproar when they saw that a man had been hit; they sprang in dismay one and all of them from their seats and looked everywhere towards the walls, but there was neither shield nor spear, and they rebuked Odysseus very angrily. ""Stranger,"" said they, ""you shall pay for shooting people in this way: you shall see no other contest  ; you are a doomed man; he whom you have slain was the foremost youth in Ithaca , and the vultures shall devour you for having killed him."""	ἦ καὶ ἐπʼ Ἀντινόῳ ἰθύνετο πικρὸν ὀϊστόν. ἦ τοι ὁ καλὸν ἄλεισον ἀναιρήσεσθαι ἔμελλε, χρύσεον ἄμφωτον, καὶ δὴ μετὰ χερσὶν ἐνώμα, ὄφρα πίοι οἴνοιο· φόνος δέ οἱ οὐκ ἐνὶ θυμῷ μέμβλετο· τίς κʼ οἴοιτο μετʼ ἀνδράσι δαιτυμόνεσσι μοῦνον ἐνὶ πλεόνεσσι, καὶ εἰ μάλα καρτερὸς εἴη, οἷ τεύξειν θάνατόν τε κακὸν καὶ κῆρα μέλαιναν; τὸν δʼ Ὀδυσεὺς κατὰ λαιμὸν ἐπισχόμενος βάλεν ἰῷ, ἀντικρὺ δʼ ἁπαλοῖο διʼ αὐχένος ἤλυθʼ ἀκωκή. ἐκλίνθη δʼ ἑτέρωσε, δέπας δέ οἱ ἔκπεσε χειρὸς βλημένου, αὐτίκα δʼ αὐλὸς ἀνὰ ῥῖνας παχὺς ἦλθεν αἵματος ἀνδρομέοιο· θοῶς δʼ ἀπὸ εἷο τράπεζαν ὦσε ποδὶ πλήξας, ἀπὸ δʼ εἴδατα χεῦεν ἔραζε· σῖτός τε κρέα τʼ ὀπτὰ φορύνετο. τοὶ δʼ ὁμάδησαν μνηστῆρες κατὰ δώμαθʼ, ὅπως ἴδον ἄνδρα πεσόντα, ἐκ δὲ θρόνων ἀνόρουσαν ὀρινθέντες κατὰ δῶμα, πάντοσε παπταίνοντες ἐϋδμήτους ποτὶ τοίχους· οὐδέ πη ἀσπὶς ἔην οὐδʼ ἄλκιμον ἔγχος ἑλέσθαι. νείκειον δʼ Ὀδυσῆα χολωτοῖσιν ἐπέεσσι· ξεῖνε, κακῶς ἀνδρῶν τοξάζεαι· οὐκέτʼ ἀέθλων ἄλλων ἀντιάσεις· νῦν τοι σῶς αἰπὺς ὄλεθρος. καὶ γὰρ δὴ νῦν φῶτα κατέκτανες ὃς μέγʼ ἄριστος κούρων εἰν Ἰθάκῃ· τῷ σʼ ἐνθάδε γῦπες ἔδονται.
Thus they spoke, for they thought that he had killed Antinoos by mistake, and did not perceive that death was hanging over the head of every one of them. But Odysseus glared at them and said:	ἴσκεν ἕκαστος ἀνήρ, ἐπεὶ ἦ φάσαν οὐκ ἐθέλοντα ἄνδρα κατακτεῖναι· τὸ δὲ νήπιοι οὐκ ἐνόησαν, ὡς δή σφιν καὶ πᾶσιν ὀλέθρου πείρατʼ ἐφῆπτο. τοὺς δʼ ἄρʼ ὑπόδρα ἰδὼν προσέφη πολύμητις Ὀδυσσεύς·
"""Dogs, did you think that I should not come back from the of the Trojans? You have wasted my substance, have forced my women servants to lie with you, and have wooed my wife while I was still living. You have feared neither the gods nor that there would be future from men, and now you shall die."""	ὦ κύνες, οὔ μʼ ἔτʼ ἐφάσκεθʼ ὑπότροπον οἴκαδʼ ἱκέσθαι δήμου ἄπο Τρώων, ὅτι μοι κατεκείρετε οἶκον, δμῳῇσιν δὲ γυναιξὶ παρευνάζεσθε βιαίως, αὐτοῦ τε ζώοντος ὑπεμνάασθε γυναῖκα, οὔτε θεοὺς δείσαντες, οἳ οὐρανὸν εὐρὺν ἔχουσιν, οὔτε τινʼ ἀνθρώπων νέμεσιν κατόπισθεν ἔσεσθαι· νῦν ὑμῖν καὶ πᾶσιν ὀλέθρου πείρατʼ ἐφῆπται.
They turned pale with fear as he spoke, and every man looked round about to see whither he might flee for safety, but Eurymakhos alone spoke.	ὣς φάτο, τοὺς δʼ ἄρα πάντας ὑπὸ χλωρὸν δέος εἷλεν· πάπτηνεν δὲ ἕκαστος ὅπη φύγοι αἰπὺν ὄλεθρον.
"""If you are Odysseus,"" said he, ""then what you have said is just. We have done much wrong on your lands and in your house. But Antinoos, who was the head and front of the offending  , lies low already. It was all his doing. It was not that he wanted to marry Penelope; he did not so much care about that; what he wanted was something quite different, and Zeus has not granted it to him; he wanted to kill your son and to be chief man in Ithaca . Now, therefore, that he has met the death which was his due, spare the lives of your people. We will make everything good among ourselves in this district  , and pay you in full for all that we have eaten and drunk. Each one of us shall pay you a fine worth twenty oxen, and we will keep on giving you gold and bronze till your heart is softened. Until we have done this no one can complain of your being enraged against us."""	Εὐρύμαχος δέ μιν οἶος ἀμειβόμενος προσέειπεν· εἰ μὲν δὴ Ὀδυσεὺς Ἰθακήσιος εἰλήλουθας, ταῦτα μὲν αἴσιμα εἶπας, ὅσα ῥέζεσκον Ἀχαιοί, πολλὰ μὲν ἐν μεγάροισιν ἀτάσθαλα, πολλὰ δʼ ἐπʼ ἀγροῦ. ἀλλʼ ὁ μὲν ἤδη κεῖται ὃς αἴτιος ἔπλετο πάντων, Ἀντίνοος· οὗτος γὰρ ἐπίηλεν τάδε ἔργα, οὔ τι γάμου τόσσον κεχρημένος οὐδὲ χατίζων, ἀλλʼ ἄλλα φρονέων, τά οἱ οὐκ ἐτέλεσσε Κρονίων, ὄφρʼ Ἰθάκης κατὰ δῆμον ἐϋκτιμένης βασιλεύοι αὐτός, ἀτὰρ σὸν παῖδα κατακτείνειε λοχήσας. νῦν δʼ ὁ μὲν ἐν μοίρῃ πέφαται, σὺ δὲ φείδεο λαῶν σῶν· ἀτὰρ ἄμμες ὄπισθεν ἀρεσσάμενοι κατὰ δῆμον, ὅσσα τοι ἐκπέποται καὶ ἐδήδοται ἐν μεγάροισι, τιμὴν ἀμφὶς ἄγοντες ἐεικοσάβοιον ἕκαστος, χαλκόν τε χρυσόν τʼ ἀποδώσομεν, εἰς ὅ κε σὸν κῆρ ἰανθῇ· πρὶν δʼ οὔ τι νεμεσσητὸν κεχολῶσθαι.
"Odysseus again glared at him and said, ""Though you should give me all that you have in the world both now and all that you ever shall have, I will not stay my hand till I have paid all of you in full. You must fight, or flee for your lives; and flee, not a man of you shall."""	τὸν δʼ ἄρʼ ὑπόδρα ἰδὼν προσέφη πολύμητις Ὀδυσσεύς· Εὐρύμαχʼ, οὐδʼ εἴ μοι πατρώϊα πάντʼ ἀποδοῖτε, ὅσσα τε νῦν ὔμμʼ ἐστὶ καὶ εἴ ποθεν ἄλλʼ ἐπιθεῖτε, οὐδέ κεν ὣς ἔτι χεῖρας ἐμὰς λήξαιμι φόνοιο πρὶν πᾶσαν μνηστῆρας ὑπερβασίην ἀποτῖσαι. νῦν ὑμῖν παράκειται ἐναντίον ἠὲ μάχεσθαι ἢ φεύγειν, ὅς κεν θάνατον καὶ κῆρας ἀλύξῃ· ἀλλά τινʼ οὐ φεύξεσθαι ὀΐομαι αἰπὺν ὄλεθρον.
Their hearts sank as they heard him, but Eurymakhos again spoke saying:	ὣς φάτο, τῶν δʼ αὐτοῦ λύτο γούνατα καὶ φίλον ἦτορ. τοῖσιν δʼ Εὐρύμαχος προσεφώνεε δεύτερον αὖτις·
"""My friends, this man will give us no quarter. He will stand where he is and shoot us down till he has killed every man among us. Let us then show fight; draw your swords, and hold up the tables to shield you from his arrows. Let us have at him with a rush, to drive him from the pavement and doorway: we can then get through into the town, and raise such an alarm as shall soon stay his shooting."""	ὦ φίλοι, οὐ γὰρ σχήσει ἀνὴρ ὅδε χεῖρας ἀάπτους, ἀλλʼ ἐπεὶ ἔλλαβε τόξον ἐΰξοον ἠδὲ φαρέτρην, οὐδοῦ ἄπο ξεστοῦ τοξάσσεται, εἰς ὅ κε πάντας ἄμμε κατακτείνῃ· ἀλλὰ μνησώμεθα χάρμης. φάσγανά τε σπάσσασθε καὶ ἀντίσχεσθε τραπέζας ἰῶν ὠκυμόρων· ἐπὶ δʼ αὐτῷ πάντες ἔχωμεν ἀθρόοι, εἴ κέ μιν οὐδοῦ ἀπώσομεν ἠδὲ θυράων, ἔλθωμεν δʼ ἀνὰ ἄστυ, βοὴ δʼ ὤκιστα γένοιτο· τῷ κε τάχʼ οὗτος ἀνὴρ νῦν ὕστατα τοξάσσαιτο.
As he spoke he drew his keen blade of bronze, sharpened on both sides, and with a loud cry sprang towards Odysseus, but Odysseus instantly shot an arrow into his breast that caught him by the nipple and fixed itself in his liver. He dropped his sword and fell doubled up over his table. The cup and all the meats went over on to the ground as he smote the earth with his forehead in the agonies of death, and he kicked the stool with his feet until his eyes were closed in darkness.	ὣς ἄρα φωνήσας εἰρύσσατο φάσγανον ὀξὺ χάλκεον, ἀμφοτέρωθεν ἀκαχμένον, ἆλτο δʼ ἐπʼ αὐτῷ σμερδαλέα ἰάχων· ὁ δʼ ἁμαρτῆ δῖος Ὀδυσσεὺς ἰὸν ἀποπροίει, βάλε δὲ στῆθος παρὰ μαζόν, ἐν δέ οἱ ἥπατι πῆξε θοὸν βέλος· ἐκ δʼ ἄρα χειρὸς φάσγανον ἧκε χαμᾶζε, περιρρηδὴς δὲ τραπέζῃ κάππεσεν ἰδνωθείς, ἀπὸ δʼ εἴδατα χεῦεν ἔραζε καὶ δέπας ἀμφικύπελλον· ὁ δὲ χθόνα τύπτε μετώπῳ θυμῷ ἀνιάζων, ποσὶ δὲ θρόνον ἀμφοτέροισι λακτίζων ἐτίνασσε· κατʼ ὀφθαλμῶν δʼ ἔχυτʼ ἀχλύς.
Then Amphinomos drew his sword and made straight at Odysseus to try and get him away from the door; but Telemakhos was too quick for him, and struck him from behind; the spear caught him between the shoulders and went right through his chest, so that he fell heavily to the ground and struck the earth with his forehead. Then Telemakhos sprang away from him, leaving his spear still in the body, for he feared that if he stayed to draw it out, some one of the Achaeans might come up and hack at him with his sword, or knock him down, so he set off at a run, and immediately was at his father's side. Then he said:	Ἀμφίνομος δʼ Ὀδυσῆος ἐείσατο κυδαλίμοιο ἀντίος ἀΐξας, εἴρυτο δὲ φάσγανον ὀξύ, εἴ πώς οἱ εἴξειε θυράων. ἀλλʼ ἄρα μιν φθῆ Τηλέμαχος κατόπισθε βαλὼν χαλκήρεϊ δουρὶ ὤμων μεσσηγύς, διὰ δὲ στήθεσφιν ἔλασσεν· δούπησεν δὲ πεσών, χθόνα δʼ ἤλασε παντὶ μετώπῳ. Τηλέμαχος δʼ ἀπόρουσε, λιπὼν δολιχόσκιον ἔγχος αὐτοῦ ἐν Ἀμφινόμῳ· περὶ γὰρ δίε μή τις Ἀχαιῶν ἔγχος ἀνελκόμενον δολιχόσκιον ἢ ἐλάσειε φασγάνῳ ἀΐξας ἠὲ προπρηνέα τύψας. βῆ δὲ θέειν, μάλα δʼ ὦκα φίλον πατέρʼ εἰσαφίκανεν, ἀγχοῦ δʼ ἱστάμενος ἔπεα πτερόεντα προσηύδα·
"""Father, let me bring you a shield, two spears, and a brass helmet for your temples. I will arm myself as well, and will bring other armor for the swineherd and the stockman, for we had better be armed."""	ὦ πάτερ, ἤδη τοι σάκος οἴσω καὶ δύο δοῦρε καὶ κυνέην πάγχαλκον, ἐπὶ κροτάφοις ἀραρυῖαν αὐτός τʼ ἀμφιβαλεῦμαι ἰών, δώσω δὲ συβώτῃ καὶ τῷ βουκόλῳ ἄλλα· τετευχῆσθαι γὰρ ἄμεινον.
"""Run and fetch them,"" answered Odysseus, ""while my arrows hold out, or when I am alone they may get me away from the door."""	τὸν δʼ ἀπαμειβόμενος προσέφη πολύμητις Ὀδυσσεύς· οἶσε θέων, ἧός μοι ἀμύνεσθαι πάρʼ ὀϊστοί, μή μʼ ἀποκινήσωσι θυράων μοῦνον ἐόντα.
Telemakhos did as his father said, and went off to the store room where the armor was kept. He chose four shields, eight spears, and four brass helmets with horse-hair plumes. He brought them with all speed to his father, and armed himself first, while the stockman and the swineherd also put on their armor, and took their places near Odysseus. Meanwhile Odysseus, as long as his arrows lasted, had been shooting the suitors one by one, and they fell thick on one another: when his arrows gave out, he set the bow to stand against the end wall of the house by the door post, and hung a shield four hides thick about his shoulders; on his comely head he set his helmet, well wrought with a crest of horse-hair that nodded menacingly above it, and he grasped two redoubtable bronze-shod spears.	ὣς φάτο, Τηλέμαχος δὲ φίλῳ ἐπεπείθετο πατρί, βῆ δʼ ἴμεναι θάλαμόνδʼ, ὅθι οἱ κλυτὰ τεύχεα κεῖτο. ἔνθεν τέσσαρα μὲν σάκεʼ ἔξελε, δούρατα δʼ ὀκτὼ καὶ πίσυρας κυνέας χαλκήρεας ἱπποδασείας· βῆ δὲ φέρων, μάλα δʼ ὦκα φίλον πατέρʼ εἰσαφίκανεν, αὐτὸς δὲ πρώτιστα περὶ χροῒ δύσετο χαλκόν· ὣς δʼ αὔτως τὼ δμῶε δυέσθην τεύχεα καλά, ἔσταν δʼ ἀμφʼ Ὀδυσῆα δαΐφρονα ποικιλομήτην. αὐτὰρ ὅ γʼ, ὄφρα μὲν αὐτῷ ἀμύνεσθαι ἔσαν ἰοί. τόφρα μνηστήρων ἕνα γʼ αἰεὶ ᾧ ἐνὶ οἴκῳ βάλλε τιτυσκόμενος· τοὶ δʼ ἀγχιστῖνοι ἔπιπτον. αὐτὰρ ἐπεὶ λίπον ἰοὶ ὀϊστεύοντα ἄνακτα, τόξον μὲν πρὸς σταθμὸν ἐϋσταθέος μεγάροιο ἔκλινʼ ἑστάμεναι, πρὸς ἐνώπια παμφανόωντα, αὐτὸς δʼ ἀμφʼ ὤμοισι σάκος θέτο τετραθέλυμνον, κρατὶ δʼ ἐπʼ ἰφθίμῳ κυνέην εὔτυκτον ἔθηκεν, ἵππουριν, δεινὸν δὲ λόφος καθύπερθεν ἔνευεν· εἵλετο δʼ ἄλκιμα δοῦρε δύω κεκορυθμένα χαλκῷ.
"Now there was a trap door on the wall, while at one end of the pavement there was an exit leading to a narrow passage, and this exit was closed by a well-made door. Odysseus told Philoitios to stand by this door and guard it, for only one person could attack it at a time. But Agelaos shouted out, ""Cannot some one go up to the trap door and tell the people what is going on? Help would come at once, and we should soon make an end of this man and his shooting."""	ὀρσοθύρη δέ τις ἔσκεν ἐϋδμήτῳ ἐνὶ τοίχῳ, ἀκρότατον δὲ παρʼ οὐδὸν ἐϋσταθέος μεγάροιο ἦν ὁδὸς ἐς λαύρην, σανίδες δʼ ἔχον εὖ ἀραρυῖαι. τὴν δʼ Ὀδυσεὺς φράζεσθαι ἀνώγει δῖον ὑφορβὸν ἑσταότʼ ἄγχʼ αὐτῆς· μία δʼ οἴη γίγνετʼ ἐφορμή. τοῖς δʼ Ἀγέλεως μετέειπεν, ἔπος πάντεσσι πιφαύσκων· ὦ φίλοι, οὐκ ἂν δή τις ἀνʼ ὀρσοθύρην ἀναβαίη καὶ εἴποι λαοῖσι, βοὴ δʼ ὤκιστα γένοιτο; τῷ κε τάχʼ οὗτος ἀνὴρ νῦν ὕστατα τοξάσσαιτο.
"""This may not be, Agelaos,"" answered Melanthios, ""the mouth of the narrow passage is dangerously near the entrance to the outer court. One brave man could prevent any number from getting in. But I know what I will do, I will bring you arms from the store room, for I am sure it is there that Odysseus and his son have put them."""	τὸν δʼ αὖτε προσέειπε Μελάνθιος, αἰπόλος αἰγῶν· οὔ πως ἔστʼ, Ἀγέλαε διοτρεφές· ἄγχι γὰρ αἰνῶς αὐλῆς καλὰ θύρετρα καὶ ἀργαλέον στόμα λαύρης· καί χʼ εἷς πάντας ἐρύκοι ἀνήρ, ὅς τʼ ἄλκιμος εἴη. ἀλλʼ ἄγεθʼ, ὑμῖν τεύχεʼ ἐνείκω θωρηχθῆναι ἐκ θαλάμου· ἔνδον γάρ, ὀΐομαι, οὐδέ πη ἄλλῃ τεύχεα κατθέσθην Ὀδυσεὺς καὶ φαίδιμος υἱός.
"On this the goatherd Melanthios went by back passages to the store room of Odysseus, house. There he chose twelve shields, with as many helmets and spears, and brought them back as fast as he could to give them to the suitors. Odysseus’ heart began to fail him when he saw the suitors putting on their armor and brandishing their spears. He saw the greatness of the danger, and said to Telemakhos, ""Some one of the women inside is helping the suitors against us, or it may be Melanthios."""	ὣς εἰπὼν ἀνέβαινε Μελάνθιος, αἰπόλος αἰγῶν, εἰς θαλάμους Ὀδυσῆος ἀνὰ ῥῶγας μεγάροιο. ἔνθεν δώδεκα μὲν σάκεʼ ἔξελε, τόσσα δὲ δοῦρα καὶ τόσσας κυνέας χαλκήρεας ἱπποδασείας· βῆ δʼ ἴμεναι, μάλα δʼ ὦκα φέρων μνηστῆρσιν ἔδωκεν. καὶ τότʼ Ὀδυσσῆος λύτο γούνατα καὶ φίλον ἦτορ, ὡς περιβαλλομένους ἴδε τεύχεα χερσί τε δοῦρα μακρὰ τινάσσοντας· μέγα δʼ αὐτῷ φαίνετο ἔργον. αἶψα δὲ Τηλέμαχον ἔπεα πτερόεντα προσηύδα· Τηλέμαχʼ, ἦ μάλα δή τις ἐνὶ μεγάροισι γυναικῶν νῶϊν ἐποτρύνει πόλεμον κακὸν ἠὲ Μελανθεύς.
"Telemakhos answered, ""The fault  , father, is mine, and mine only; I left the store room door open, and they have kept a sharper look out than I have. Go, Eumaios, put the door to, and see whether it is one of the women who is doing this, or whether, as I suspect, it is Melanthios the son of Dolios."""	τὸν δʼ αὖ Τηλέμαχος πεπνυμένος ἀντίον ηὔδα· ὦ πάτερ, αὐτὸς ἐγὼ τόδε γʼ ἤμβροτον—οὐδέ τις ἄλλος αἴτιος—ὃς θαλάμοιο θύρην πυκινῶς ἀραρυῖαν κάλλιπον ἀγκλίνας· τῶν δὲ σκοπὸς ἦεν ἀμείνων. ἀλλʼ ἴθι, δῖʼ Εὔμαιε, θύρην ἐπίθες θαλάμοιο καὶ φράσαι ἤ τις ἄρʼ ἐστὶ γυναικῶν ἣ τάδε ῥέζει, ἢ υἱὸς Δολίοιο, Μελανθεύς, τόν περ ὀΐω.
"Thus did they converse. Meanwhile Melanthios was again going to the store room to fetch more armor, but the swineherd saw him and said to Odysseus who was beside him, ""Odysseus, noble son of Laertes , it is that scoundrel Melanthios, just as we suspected, who is going to the store room. Say, shall I kill him, if I can get the better of him, or shall I bring him here that you may take your own revenge for all the many wrongs that he has done in your house?"""	ὣς οἱ μὲν τοιαῦτα πρὸς ἀλλήλους ἀγόρευον, βῆ δʼ αὖτις θάλαμόνδε Μελάνθιος, αἰπόλος αἰγῶν, οἴσων τεύχεα καλά. νόησε δὲ δῖος ὑφορβός, αἶψα δʼ Ὀδυσσῆα προσεφώνεεν ἐγγὺς ἐόντα· διογενὲς Λαερτιάδη, πολυμήχανʼ Ὀδυσσεῦ, κεῖνος δʼ αὖτʼ ἀΐδηλος ἀνήρ, ὃν ὀϊόμεθʼ αὐτοί, ἔρχεται ἐς θάλαμον· σὺ δέ μοι νημερτὲς ἐνίσπες, ἤ μιν ἀποκτείνω, αἴ κε κρείσσων γε γένωμαι, ἦε σοὶ ἐνθάδʼ ἄγω, ἵνʼ ὑπερβασίας ἀποτίσῃ πολλάς, ὅσσας οὗτος ἐμήσατο σῷ ἐνὶ οἴκῳ.
"Odysseus answered, ""Telemakhos and I will hold these suitors in check, no matter what they do; go back both of you and bind Melanthios’ hands and feet behind him. Throw him into the store room and make the door fast behind you; then fasten a noose about his body, and string him close up to the rafters from a high bearing-post, that he may linger on in an agony."""	τὸν δʼ ἀπαμειβόμενος προσέφη πολύμητις Ὀδυσσεύς· ἦ τοι ἐγὼ καὶ Τηλέμαχος μνηστῆρας ἀγαυοὺς σχήσομεν ἔντοσθεν μεγάρων, μάλα περ μεμαῶτας. σφῶϊ δʼ ἀποστρέψαντε πόδας καὶ χεῖρας ὕπερθεν ἐς θάλαμον βαλέειν, σανίδας δʼ ἐκδῆσαι ὄπισθε, σειρὴν δὲ πλεκτὴν ἐξ αὐτοῦ πειρήναντε κίονʼ ἀνʼ ὑψηλὴν ἐρύσαι πελάσαι τε δοκοῖσιν, ὥς κεν δηθὰ ζωὸς ἐὼν χαλέπʼ ἄλγεα πάσχῃ·
"Thus did he speak, and they did even as he had said; they went to the store room, which they entered before Melanthios saw them, for he was busy searching for arms in the innermost part of the room, so the two took their stand on either side of the door and waited. By and by Melanthios came out with a helmet in one hand, and an old dry-rotted shield in the other, which had been borne by Laertes when he was young, but which had been long since thrown aside, and the straps had become unsewn; on this the two seized him, dragged him back by the hair, and threw him struggling to the ground. They bent his hands and feet well behind his back, and bound them tight with a painful bond as Odysseus had told them; then they fastened a noose about his body and strung him up from a high pillar till he was close up to the rafters, and over him did you then vaunt, O swineherd Eumaios, saying, ""Melanthios, you will pass the night on a soft bed as you deserve. You will know very well when morning comes from the streams of Okeanos, and it is time for you to be driving in your goats for the suitors to feast on."""	ὣς ἔφαθʼ, οἱ δʼ ἄρα τοῦ μάλα μὲν κλύον ἠδʼ ἐπίθοντο, βὰν δʼ ἴμεν ἐς θάλαμον, λαθέτην δέ μιν ἔνδον ἐόντα. ἦ τοι ὁ μὲν θαλάμοιο μυχὸν κάτα τεύχεʼ ἐρεύνα, τὼ δʼ ἔσταν ἑκάτερθε παρὰ σταθμοῖσι μένοντε. εὖθʼ ὑπὲρ οὐδὸν ἔβαινε Μελάνθιος, αἰπόλος αἰγῶν, τῇ ἑτέρῃ μὲν χειρὶ φέρων καλὴν τρυφάλειαν, τῇ δʼ ἑτέρῃ σάκος εὐρὺ γέρον, πεπαλαγμένον ἄζῃ, Λαέρτεω ἥρωος, ὃ κουρίζων φορέεσκε· δὴ τότε γʼ ἤδη κεῖτο, ῥαφαὶ δὲ λέλυντο ἱμάντων· τὼ δʼ ἄρʼ ἐπαΐξανθʼ ἑλέτην ἔρυσάν τέ μιν εἴσω κουρίξ, ἐν δαπέδῳ δὲ χαμαὶ βάλον ἀχνύμενον κῆρ, σὺν δὲ πόδας χεῖράς τε δέον θυμαλγέϊ δεσμῷ εὖ μάλʼ ἀποστρέψαντε διαμπερές, ὡς ἐκέλευσεν υἱὸς Λαέρταο, πολύτλας δῖος Ὀδυσσεύς· σειρὴν δὲ πλεκτὴν ἐξ αὐτοῦ πειρήναντε κίονʼ ἀνʼ ὑψηλὴν ἔρυσαν πέλασάν τε δοκοῖσι. τὸν δʼ ἐπικερτομέων προσέφης, Εὔμαιε συβῶτα· νῦν μὲν δὴ μάλα πάγχυ, Μελάνθιε, νύκτα φυλάξεις, εὐνῇ ἔνι μαλακῇ καταλέγμενος, ὥς σε ἔοικεν· οὐδέ σέ γʼ ἠριγένεια παρʼ Ὠκεανοῖο ῥοάων λήσει ἐπερχομένη χρυσόθρονος, ἡνίκʼ ἀγινεῖς αἶγας μνηστήρεσσι δόμον κάτα δαῖτα πένεσθαι.
"There, then, they left him in very cruel bondage, and having put on their armor they closed the door behind them and went back to take their places by the side of Odysseus; whereon the four men stood in the room, fierce and full of fury; nevertheless, those who were in the body of the court were still both brave and many. Then Zeus’ daughter Athena came up to them, having assumed the voice and form of Mentor. Odysseus was glad when he saw her and said, ""Mentor, lend me your help, and forget not your old comrade, nor the many good turns he has done you. Besides, you are my age-mate."""	ὣς ὁ μὲν αὖθι λέλειπτο, ταθεὶς ὀλοῷ ἐνὶ δεσμῷ· τὼ δʼ ἐς τεύχεα δύντε, θύρην ἐπιθέντε φαεινήν, βήτην εἰς Ὀδυσῆα δαΐφρονα, ποικιλομήτην. ἔνθα μένος πνείοντες ἐφέστασαν, οἱ μὲν ἐπʼ οὐδοῦ τέσσαρες, οἱ δʼ ἔντοσθε δόμων πολέες τε καὶ ἐσθλοί. τοῖσι δʼ ἐπʼ ἀγχίμολον θυγάτηρ Διὸς ἦλθεν Ἀθήνη, Μέντορι εἰδομένη ἠμὲν δέμας ἠδὲ καὶ αὐδήν. τὴν δʼ Ὀδυσεὺς γήθησεν ἰδὼν καὶ μῦθον ἔειπε· Μέντορ, ἄμυνον ἀρήν, μνῆσαι δʼ ἑτάροιο φίλοιο, ὅς σʼ ἀγαθὰ ῥέζεσκον· ὁμηλικίην δέ μοί ἐσσι.
"But all the time he felt sure it was Athena, and the suitors from the other side raised an uproar when they saw her. Agelaos was the first to reproach her. ""Mentor,"" he cried, ""do not let Odysseus beguile you into siding with him and fighting the suitors. This is what will be our plan  : when we have killed these people, father and son, we will kill you too. You shall pay for it with your head, and when we have killed you, we will take all you have, in doors or out, and merge it with Odysseus’ property; we will not let your sons live in your house, nor your daughters, nor shall your widow continue to live in the city of Ithaca ."""	ὣς φάτʼ, ὀϊόμενος λαοσσόον ἔμμεν Ἀθήνην. μνηστῆρες δʼ ἑτέρωθεν ὁμόκλεον ἐν μεγάροισι· πρῶτος τήν γʼ ἐνένιπε Δαμαστορίδης Ἀγέλαος· Μέντορ, μή σʼ ἐπέεσσι παραιπεπίθῃσιν Ὀδυσσεὺς μνηστήρεσσι μάχεσθαι, ἀμυνέμεναι δέ οἱ αὐτῷ. ὧδε γὰρ ἡμέτερόν γε νόον τελέεσθαι ὀΐω· ὁππότε κεν τούτους κτέωμεν, πατέρʼ ἠδὲ καὶ υἱόν, ἐν δὲ σὺ τοῖσιν ἔπειτα πεφήσεαι, οἷα μενοινᾷς ἔρδειν ἐν μεγάροις· σῷ δʼ αὐτοῦ κράατι τίσεις. αὐτὰρ ἐπὴν ὑμέων γε βίας ἀφελώμεθα χαλκῷ, κτήμαθʼ ὁπόσσα τοί ἐστι, τά τʼ ἔνδοθι καὶ τὰ θύρηφι, τοῖσιν Ὀδυσσῆος μεταμίξομεν· οὐδέ τοι υἷας ζώειν ἐν μεγάροισιν ἐάσομεν, οὐδέ θύγατρας οὐδʼ ἄλοχον κεδνὴν Ἰθάκης κατὰ ἄστυ πολεύειν.
"This made Athena still more furious, so she scolded Odysseus very angrily. ""Odysseus,"" said she, ""your strength and prowess are no longer what they were when you fought for nine long years among the Trojans about the noble lady Helen. You killed many a man in those days, and it was through your stratagem that Priam's city was taken. How comes it that you are so lamentably less valiant now that you are on your own ground, face to face with the suitors in your own house? Come on, my good fellow, stand by my side and see how Mentor, son of Alkinoos shall fight your foes and requite your kindnesses conferred upon him."""	ὣς φάτʼ, Ἀθηναίη δὲ χολώσατο κηρόθι μᾶλλον, νείκεσσεν δʼ Ὀδυσῆα χολωτοῖσιν ἐπέεσσιν· οὐκέτι σοί γʼ, Ὀδυσεῦ, μένος ἔμπεδον οὐδέ τις ἀλκή οἵη ὅτʼ ἀμφʼ Ἑλένῃ λευκωλένῳ εὐπατερείῃ, εἰνάετες Τρώεσσιν ἐμάρναο νωλεμὲς αἰεί, πολλοὺς δʼ ἄνδρας ἔπεφνες ἐν αἰνῇ δηϊοτῆτι, σῇ δʼ ἥλω βουλῇ Πριάμου πόλις εὐρυάγυια. πῶς δὴ νῦν, ὅτε σόν τε δόμον καὶ κτήμαθʼ ἱκάνεις, ἄντα μνηστήρων ὀλοφύρεαι ἄλκιμος εἶναι; ἀλλʼ ἄγε δεῦρο, πέπον, παρʼ ἔμʼ ἵστασο καὶ ἴδε ἔργον, ὄφρʼ εἰδῇς οἷός τοι ἐν ἀνδράσι δυσμενέεσσιν Μέντωρ Ἀλκιμίδης εὐεργεσίας ἀποτίνειν.
But she would not give him full victory as yet, for she wished still further to prove his own prowess and that of his brave son, so she flew up to one of the rafters in the roof of the room and sat upon it in the form of a swallow.	ἦ ῥα, καὶ οὔ πω πάγχυ δίδου ἑτεραλκέα νίκην, ἀλλʼ ἔτʼ ἄρα σθένεός τε καὶ ἀλκῆς πειρήτιζεν ἠμὲν Ὀδυσσῆος ἠδʼ υἱοῦ κυδαλίμοιο. αὐτὴ δʼ αἰθαλόεντος ἀνὰ μεγάροιο μέλαθρον ἕζετʼ ἀναΐξασα, χελιδόνι εἰκέλη ἄντην.
"Meanwhile Agelaos son of Damastor, Eurynomos, Amphimedon, Demoptolemos, Peisandros, and Polybos son of Polyktor bore the brunt of the fight upon the suitors’ side; of all those who were still fighting for their lives  , they were by far the most excellent in , for the others had already fallen under the arrows of Odysseus. Agelaos shouted to them and said, ""My friends, he will soon have to leave off, for Mentor has gone away after having done nothing for him but brag. They are standing at the doors unsupported. Do not aim at him all at once, but six of you throw your spears first, and see if you cannot cover yourselves with glory by killing him. When he has fallen we need not be uneasy about the others."""	μνηστῆρας δʼ ὤτρυνε Δαμαστορίδης Ἀγέλαος, Εὐρύνομός τε καὶ Ἀμφιμέδων Δημοπτόλεμός τε, Πείσανδρός τε Πολυκτορίδης Πόλυβός τε δαΐφρων· οἱ γὰρ μνηστήρων ἀρετῇ ἔσαν ἔξοχʼ ἄριστοι, ὅσσοι ἔτʼ ἔζωον περί τε ψυχέων ἐμάχοντο· τοὺς δʼ ἤδη ἐδάμασσε βιὸς καὶ ταρφέες ἰοί. τοῖς δʼ Ἀγέλεως μετέειπεν, ἔπος πάντεσσι πιφαύσκων· ὦ φίλοι, ἤδη σχήσει ἀνὴρ ὅδε χεῖρας ἀάπτους· καὶ δή οἱ Μέντωρ μὲν ἔβη κενὰ εὔγματα εἰπών, οἱ δʼ οἶοι λείπονται ἐπὶ πρώτῃσι θύρῃσι. τῷ νῦν μὴ ἅμα πάντες ἐφίετε δούρατα μακρά, ἀλλʼ ἄγεθʼ οἱ ἓξ πρῶτον ἀκοντίσατʼ, αἴ κέ ποθι Ζεὺς δώῃ Ὀδυσσῆα βλῆσθαι καὶ κῦδος ἀρέσθαι. τῶν δʼ ἄλλων οὐ κῆδος, ἐπὴν οὗτός γε πέσῃσιν.
"They threw their spears as he bade them, but Athena made them all of no effect. One hit the door post; another went against the door; the pointed shaft of another struck the wall; and as soon as they had avoided all the spears of the suitors Odysseus said to his own men, ""My friends, I should say we too had better let drive into the middle of them, or they will crown all the harm they have done us by killing us outright."""	ὣς ἔφαθʼ, οἱ δʼ ἄρα πάντες ἀκόντισαν ὡς ἐκέλευεν, ἱέμενοι· τὰ δὲ πάντα ἐτώσια θῆκεν Ἀθήνη, τῶν ἄλλος μὲν σταθμὸν ἐϋσταθέος μεγάροιο βεβλήκει, ἄλλος δὲ θύρην πυκινῶς ἀραρυῖαν· ἄλλου δʼ ἐν τοίχῳ μελίη πέσε χαλκοβάρεια. αὐτὰρ ἐπεὶ δὴ δούρατʼ ἀλεύαντο μνηστήρων, τοῖς δʼ ἄρα μύθων ἦρχε πολύτλας δῖος Ὀδυσσεύς· ὦ φίλοι, ἤδη μέν κεν ἐγὼν εἴποιμι καὶ ἄμμι μνηστήρων ἐς ὅμιλον ἀκοντίσαι, οἳ μεμάασιν ἡμέας ἐξεναρίξαι ἐπὶ προτέροισι κακοῖσιν.
They therefore aimed straight in front of them and threw their spears. Odysseus killed Demoptolemos, Telemakhos Euryades, Eumaios Elatus, while the stockman killed Peisandros. These all bit the dust, and as the others drew back into a corner Odysseus and his men rushed forward and regained their spears by drawing them from the bodies of the dead.	ὣς ἔφαθʼ, οἱ δʼ ἄρα πάντες ἀκόντισαν ὀξέα δοῦρα ἄντα τιτυσκόμενοι· Δημοπτόλεμον μὲν Ὀδυσσεύς, Εὐρυάδην δʼ ἄρα Τηλέμαχος, Ἔλατον δὲ συβώτης, Πείσανδρον δʼ ἄρʼ ἔπεφνε βοῶν ἐπιβουκόλος ἀνήρ. οἱ μὲν ἔπειθʼ ἅμα πάντες ὀδὰξ ἕλον ἄσπετον οὖδας, μνηστῆρες δʼ ἀνεχώρησαν μεγάροιο μυχόνδε· τοὶ δʼ ἄρʼ ἐπήϊξαν, νεκύων δʼ ἐξ ἔγχεʼ ἕλοντο.
"The suitors now aimed a second time, but again Athena made their weapons for the most part without effect. One hit a bearing-post of the room; another went against the door; while the pointed shaft of another struck the wall. Still, Amphimedon just took a piece of the top skin from off Telemakhos’ wrist, and Ktesippos managed to graze Eumaios’ shoulder above his shield; but the spear went on and fell to the ground. Then Odysseus and his men let drive into the crowd of suitors. Odysseus hit Eurydamas, Telemakhos Amphimedon, and Eumaios Polybos. After this the stockman hit Ktesippos in the breast, and taunted him saying, ""Foul-mouthed son of Polytherses, do not be so foolish as to talk wickedly another time, but let heaven direct your speech, for the gods are far stronger than men. I make you a present of this advice to repay you for the foot which you gave Odysseus when he was begging about in his own house."""	αὖτις δὲ μνηστῆρες ἀκόντισαν ὀξέα δοῦρα ἱέμενοι· τὰ δὲ πολλὰ ἐτώσια θῆκεν Ἀθήνη. τῶν ἄλλος μὲν σταθμὸν ἐϋσταθέος μεγάροιο βεβλήκειν, ἄλλος δὲ θύρην πυκινῶς ἀραρυῖαν· ἄλλου δʼ ἐν τοίχῳ μελίη πέσε χαλκοβάρεια.

Thus spoke the stockman, and Odysseus struck the son of Damastor with a spear in close fight, while Telemakhos hit Leiokritos son of Euenor in the belly, and the dart went clean through him, so that he fell forward full on his face upon the ground. Then Athena from her seat on the rafter held up her deadly aegis, and the hearts of the suitors quailed. They fled to the other end of the court like a herd of cattle maddened by the gadfly in early summer   when the days are at their longest. As eagle-beaked, crook-taloned vultures from the mountains swoop down on the smaller birds that cower in flocks upon the ground, and kill them, for they cannot either fight or flee, and lookers on enjoy the sport - even so did Odysseus and his men fall upon the suitors and smite them on every side. They made a horrible groaning as their brains were being battered in, and the ground seethed with their blood.	ἦ ῥα βοῶν ἑλίκων ἐπιβουκόλος· αὐτὰρ Ὀδυσσεὺς οὖτα Δαμαστορίδην αὐτοσχεδὸν ἔγχεϊ μακρῷ.

"Leiodes then caught the knees of Odysseus and said, ""Odysseus I beseech you have mercy upon me and spare me. I never wronged any of the women in your house either in word or deed, and I tried to stop the others. I saw them, but they would not listen, and now they are paying for their folly. I was their sacrificing priest; if you kill me, I shall die without having done anything to deserve it, and shall have got no thanks   for all the good that I did."""	Λειώδης δʼ Ὀδυσῆος ἐπεσσύμενος λάβε γούνων, καί μιν λισσόμενος ἔπεα πτερόεντα προσηύδα· γουνοῦμαί σʼ, Ὀδυσεῦ· σὺ δέ μʼ αἴδεο καί μʼ ἐλέησον· οὐ γάρ πώ τινά φημι γυναικῶν ἐν μεγάροισιν εἰπεῖν οὐδέ τι ῥέξαι ἀτάσθαλον· ἀλλὰ καὶ ἄλλους παύεσκον μνηστῆρας, ὅτις τοιαῦτά γε ῥέζοι. ἀλλά μοι οὐ πείθοντο κακῶν ἄπο χεῖρας ἔχεσθαι· τῷ καὶ ἀτασθαλίῃσιν ἀεικέα πότμον ἐπέσπον. αὐτὰρ ἐγὼ μετὰ τοῖσι θυοσκόος οὐδὲν ἐοργὼς κείσομαι, ὡς οὐκ ἔστι χάρις μετόπισθʼ εὐεργέων·
"Odysseus looked sternly at him and answered, ""If you were their sacrificing priest, you must have prayed many a time that it might be long before I got home again  , and that you might marry my wife and have children by her. Therefore you shall die."""	τὸν δʼ ἄρʼ ὑπόδρα ἰδὼν προσέφη πολύμητις Ὀδυσσεύς· εἰ μὲν δὴ μετὰ τοῖσι θυοσκόος εὔχεαι εἶναι, πολλάκι που μέλλεις ἀρήμεναι ἐν μεγάροισι τηλοῦ ἐμοὶ νόστοιο τέλος γλυκεροῖο γενέσθαι, σοὶ δʼ ἄλοχόν τε φίλην σπέσθαι καὶ τέκνα τεκέσθαι· τῷ οὐκ ἂν θάνατόν γε δυσηλεγέα προφύγοισθα.
With these words he picked up the sword that Agelaos had dropped when he was being killed, and which was lying upon the ground. Then he struck Leiodes on the back of his neck, so that his head fell rolling in the dust while he was yet speaking.	ὣς ἄρα φωνήσας ξίφος εἵλετο χειρὶ παχείῃ κείμενον, ὅ ῥʼ Ἀγέλαος ἀποπροέηκε χαμᾶζε κτεινόμενος· τῷ τόν γε κατʼ αὐχένα μέσσον ἔλασσε. φθεγγομένου δʼ ἄρα τοῦ γε κάρη κονίῃσιν ἐμίχθη.
"The minstrel Phemios son of Terpes - he who had been forced by the suitors to sing to them - now tried to save his life. He was standing near towards the trap door, and held his lyre in his hand. He did not know whether to flee out of the room and sit down by the altar of Zeus that was in the outer court, and on which both Laertes and Odysseus had offered up the thigh bones of many an ox, or whether to go straight up to Odysseus and embrace his knees, but in the end he deemed it best to embrace Odysseus’ knees. So he laid his lyre on the ground the ground between the mixing-bowl and the silver-studded seat; then going up to Odysseus he caught hold of his knees and said, ""Odysseus, I beseech you have mercy on me and spare me. You will be sorry   for it afterwards if you kill a bard who can sing both for gods and men as I can. I make all my lays myself, and heaven visits me with every kind of inspiration. I would sing to you as though you were a god, do not therefore be in such a hurry to cut my head off. Your own son Telemakhos will tell you that I did not want to frequent your house and sing to the suitors after their meals, but they were too many and too strong for me, so they made me."""

"Telemakhos heard him, and at once went up to his father. ""Hold!"" he cried, ""the man is guiltless, do him no hurt; and we will spare Medon too, who was always good to me when I was a boy, unless Philoitios or Eumaios has already killed him, or he has fallen in your way when you were raging about the court."""	ὣς φάτο, τοῦ δʼ ἤκουσʼ ἱερὴ ἲς Τηλεμάχοιο, αἶψα δʼ ἑὸν πατέρα προσεφώνεεν ἐγγὺς ἐόντα· ἴσχεο μηδέ τι τοῦτον ἀναίτιον οὔταε χαλκῷ· καὶ κήρυκα Μέδοντα σαώσομεν, ὅς τέ μευ αἰεὶ οἴκῳ ἐν ἡμετέρῳ κηδέσκετο παιδὸς ἐόντος, εἰ δὴ μή μιν ἔπεφνε Φιλοίτιος ἠὲ συβώτης, ἠὲ σοὶ ἀντεβόλησεν ὀρινομένῳ κατὰ δῶμα.
Medon caught these words of Telemakhos, for he was crouching under a seat beneath which he had hidden by covering himself up with a freshly flayed heifer's hide, so he threw off the hide, went up to Telemakhos, and laid hold of his knees.	ὣς φάτο, τοῦ δʼ ἤκουσε Μέδων πεπνυμένα εἰδώς· πεπτηὼς γὰρ ἔκειτο ὑπὸ θρόνον, ἀμφὶ δὲ δέρμα ἕστο βοὸς νεόδαρτον, ἀλύσκων κῆρα μέλαιναν. αἶψα δʼ ἀπὸ θρόνου ὦρτο, θοῶς δʼ ἀπέδυνε βοείην.

"""Here I am, my dear sir,"" said he, ""stay your hand therefore, and tell your father, or he will kill me in his rage against the suitors for having wasted his substance and been so foolishly disrespectful to yourself."""	ὦ φίλʼ, ἐγὼ μὲν ὅδʼ εἰμί, σὺ δʼ ἴσχεο εἰπὲ δὲ πατρὶ μή με περισθενέων δηλήσεται ὀξέϊ χαλκῷ, ἀνδρῶν μνηστήρων κεχολωμένος, οἵ οἱ ἔκειρον κτήματʼ ἐνὶ μεγάροις, σὲ δὲ νήπιοι οὐδὲν ἔτιον.
"Odysseus smiled at him and answered, ""Fear not; Telemakhos has saved your life, that you may know in future, and tell other people, how greatly better good deeds prosper than evil ones. Go, therefore, outside the cloisters into the outer court, and be out of the way of the slaughter - you and the bard - while I finish my work here inside."""	τὸν δʼ ἐπιμειδήσας προσέφη πολύμητις Ὀδυσσεύς· θάρσει, ἐπεὶ δή σʼ οὗτος ἐρύσσατο καὶ ἐσάωσεν, ὄφρα γνῷς κατὰ θυμόν, ἀτὰρ εἴπῃσθα καὶ ἄλλῳ, ὡς κακοεργίης εὐεργεσίη μέγʼ ἀμείνων. ἀλλʼ ἐξελθόντες μεγάρων ἕζεσθε θύραζε ἐκ φόνου εἰς αὐλήν, σύ τε καὶ πολύφημος ἀοιδός, ὄφρʼ ἂν ἐγὼ κατὰ δῶμα πονήσομαι ὅττεό με χρή.
The pair went into the outer court as fast as they could, and sat down by Zeus’ great altar, looking fearfully round, and still expecting that they would be killed. Then Odysseus searched the whole court carefully over, to see if anyone had managed to hide himself and was still living, but he found them all lying in the dust and weltering in their blood. They were like fishes which fishermen have netted out of the sea, and thrown upon the beach to lie gasping for water till the heat of the sun makes an end of them. Even so were the suitors lying all huddled up one against the other.	ὣς φάτο, τὼ δʼ ἔξω βήτην μεγάροιο κιόντε, ἑζέσθην δʼ ἄρα τώ γε Διὸς μεγάλου ποτὶ βωμόν, πάντοσε παπταίνοντε, φόνον ποτιδεγμένω αἰεί. πάπτηνεν δʼ Ὀδυσεὺς καθʼ ἑὸν δόμον, εἴ τις ἔτʼ ἀνδρῶν ζωὸς ὑποκλοπέοιτο, ἀλύσκων κῆρα μέλαιναν. τοὺς δὲ ἴδεν μάλα πάντας ἐν αἵματι καὶ κονίῃσι πεπτεῶτας πολλούς, ὥστʼ ἰχθύας, οὕς θʼ ἁλιῆες κοῖλον ἐς αἰγιαλὸν πολιῆς ἔκτοσθε θαλάσσης δικτύῳ ἐξέρυσαν πολυωπῷ· οἱ δέ τε πάντες κύμαθʼ ἁλὸς ποθέοντες ἐπὶ ψαμάθοισι κέχυνται· τῶν μέν τʼ Ἠέλιος φαέθων ἐξείλετο θυμόν· ὣς τότʼ ἄρα μνηστῆρες ἐπʼ ἀλλήλοισι κέχυντο.
"Then Odysseus said to Telemakhos, ""Call nurse Eurykleia; I have something to say to her."""	δὴ τότε Τηλέμαχον προσέφη πολύμητις Ὀδυσσεύς· Τηλέμαχʼ, εἰ δʼ ἄγε μοι κάλεσον τροφὸν Εὐρύκλειαν, ὄφρα ἔπος εἴπωμι τό μοι καταθύμιόν ἐστιν.
"Telemakhos went and knocked at the door of the women's room. ""Make haste,"" said he, ""you old woman who have been set over all the other women in the house. Come outside; my father wishes to speak to you."""	ὣς φάτο, Τηλέμαχος δὲ φίλῳ ἐπεπείθετο πατρί, κινήσας δὲ θύρην προσέφη τροφὸν Εὐρύκλειαν· δεῦρο δὴ ὄρσο, γρηῢ παλαιγενές, ἥ τε γυναικῶν δμῳάων σκοπός ἐσσι κατὰ μέγαρʼ ἡμετεράων· ἔρχεο· κικλήσκει σε πατὴρ ἐμός, ὄφρα τι εἴπῃ.
"When Eurykleia heard this she unfastened the door of the women's room and came out, following Telemakhos. She found Odysseus among the corpses bespattered with blood and filth like a lion that has just been devouring an ox, and his breast and both his cheeks are all bloody, so that he is a fearful sight; even so was Odysseus besmirched from head to foot with gore. When she saw all the corpses and such a quantity of blood, she was beginning to cry out for joy, for she saw that a great deed had been done; but Odysseus checked her, ""Old woman,"" said he, ""rejoice in silence; restrain yourself, and do not make any noise about it; it is an unholy thing to vaunt over dead men. Heaven's doom and their own evil deeds have brought these men to destruction, for they respected no man in the whole world, neither rich nor poor, who came near them, and they have come to a bad end as a punishment for their wickedness and folly. Now, however, tell me which of the women in the house have misconducted themselves, and who are innocent."""	ὣς ἄρʼ ἐφώνησεν, τῇ δʼ ἄπτερος ἔπλετο μῦθος, ὤϊξεν δὲ θύρας μεγάρων εὖ ναιεταόντων, βῆ δʼ ἴμεν· αὐτὰρ Τηλέμαχος πρόσθʼ ἡγεμόνευεν. εὗρεν ἔπειτʼ Ὀδυσῆα μετὰ κταμένοισι νέκυσσιν, αἵματι καὶ λύθρῳ πεπαλαγμένον ὥστε λέοντα, ὅς ῥά τε βεβρωκὼς βοὸς ἔρχεται ἀγραύλοιο· πᾶν δʼ ἄρα οἱ στῆθός τε παρήϊά τʼ ἀμφοτέρωθεν αἱματόεντα πέλει, δεινὸς δʼ εἰς ὦπα ἰδέσθαι· ὣς Ὀδυσεὺς πεπάλακτο πόδας καὶ χεῖρας ὕπερθεν. ἡ δʼ ὡς οὖν νέκυάς τε καὶ ἄσπετον εἴσιδεν αἷμα, ἴθυσέν ῥʼ ὀλολύξαι, ἐπεὶ μέγα εἴσιδεν ἔργον· ἀλλʼ Ὀδυσεὺς κατέρυκε καὶ ἔσχεθεν ἱεμένην περ, καί μιν φωνήσας ἔπεα πτερόεντα προσηύδα· ἐν θυμῷ, γρηῦ, χαῖρε καὶ ἴσχεο μηδʼ ὀλόλυζε· οὐχ ὁσίη κταμένοισιν ἐπʼ ἀνδράσιν εὐχετάασθαι. τούσδε δὲ μοῖρʼ ἐδάμασσε θεῶν καὶ σχέτλια ἔργα· οὔ τινα γὰρ τίεσκον ἐπιχθονίων ἀνθρώπων, οὐ κακὸν οὐδὲ μὲν ἐσθλόν, ὅτις σφέας εἰσαφίκοιτο· τῷ καὶ ἀτασθαλίῃσιν ἀεικέα πότμον ἐπέσπον. ἀλλʼ ἄγε μοι σὺ γυναῖκας ἐνὶ μεγάροις κατάλεξον, αἵ τέ μʼ ἀτιμάζουσι καὶ αἳ νηλείτιδές εἰσιν.
"""I will tell you the truth  , my son,"" answered Eurykleia. ""There are fifty women in the house whom we teach to do things, such as carding wool, and all kinds of household work. Of these, twelve in all have misbehaved, and have been wanting in respect to me, and also to Penelope. They showed no disrespect to Telemakhos, for he has only lately grown and his mother never permitted him to give orders to the female servants; but let me go upstairs and tell your wife all that has happened, for some god has been sending her to sleep."""	τὸν δʼ αὖτε προσέειπε φίλη τροφὸς Εὐρύκλεια· τοιγὰρ ἐγώ τοι, τέκνον, ἀληθείην καταλέξω. πεντήκοντά τοί εἰσιν ἐνὶ μεγάροισι γυναῖκες δμῳαί, τὰς μέν τʼ ἔργα διδάξαμεν ἐργάζεσθαι, εἴριά τε ξαίνειν καὶ δουλοσύνην ἀνέχεσθαι· τάων δώδεκα πᾶσαι ἀναιδείης ἐπέβησαν, οὔτʼ ἐμὲ τίουσαι οὔτʼ αὐτὴν Πηνελόπειαν.

"""Do not wake her yet,"" answered Odysseus, ""but tell the women who have misconducted themselves to come to me."""	τὴν δʼ ἀπαμειβόμενος προσέφη πολύμητις Ὀδυσσεύς
"Eurykleia left the room to tell the women, and make them come to Odysseus; in the meantime he called Telemakhos, the stockman, and the swineherd. ""Begin,"" said he, ""to remove the dead, and make the women help you. Then, get sponges and clean water to swill down the tables and seats. When you have thoroughly cleansed the whole cloisters, take the women into the space between the domed room and the wall of the outer court, and run them through with your swords till they are quite dead, and have forgotten all about love and the way in which they used to lie in secret with the suitors."""	μή πω τήνδʼ ἐπέγειρε· σὺ δʼ ἐνθάδε εἰπὲ γυναιξὶν ἐλθέμεν, αἵ περ πρόσθεν ἀεικέα μηχανόωντο. ὣς ἄρʼ ἔφη, γρηῢς δὲ διὲκ μεγάροιο βεβήκει ἀγγελέουσα γυναιξὶ καὶ ὀτρυνέουσα νέεσθαι. αὐτὰρ ὁ Τηλέμαχον καὶ βουκόλον ἠδὲ συβώτην εἰς ἓ καλεσσάμενος ἔπεα πτερόεντα προσηύδα· ἄρχετε νῦν νέκυας φορέειν καὶ ἄνωχθε γυναῖκας· αὐτὰρ ἔπειτα θρόνους περικαλλέας ἠδὲ τραπέζας ὕδατι καὶ σπόγγοισι πολυτρήτοισι καθαίρειν. αὐτὰρ ἐπὴν δὴ πάντα δόμον κατακοσμήσησθε, δμῳὰς ἐξαγαγόντες ἐϋσταθέος μεγάροιο, μεσσηγύς τε θόλου καὶ ἀμύμονος ἕρκεος αὐλῆς, θεινέμεναι ξίφεσιν τανυήκεσιν, εἰς ὅ κε πασέων ψυχὰς ἐξαφέλησθε καὶ ἐκλελάθωντʼ Ἀφροδίτης, τὴν ἄρʼ ὑπὸ μνηστῆρσιν ἔχον μίσγοντό τε λάθρη.
"On this the women came down in a body, weeping and wailing bitterly. First they carried the dead bodies out, and propped them up against one another in the gatehouse. Odysseus ordered them about and made them do their work quickly, so they had to carry the bodies out. When they had done this, they cleaned all the tables and seats with sponges and water, while Telemakhos and the two others shoveled up the blood and dirt from the ground, and the women carried it all away and put it out of doors. Then when they had made the whole place quite clean and orderly, they took the women out and hemmed them in the narrow space between the wall of the domed room and that of the yard, so that they could not get away: and Telemakhos said to the other two, ""I shall not let these women die a clean death, for they were insolent to me and my mother, and used to sleep with the suitors."""	ὣς ἔφαθʼ, αἱ δὲ γυναῖκες ἀολλέες ἦλθον ἅπασαι, αἴνʼ ὀλοφυρόμεναι, θαλερὸν κατὰ δάκρυ χέουσαι. πρῶτα μὲν οὖν νέκυας φόρεον κατατεθνηῶτας, κὰδ δʼ ἄρʼ ὑπʼ αἰθούσῃ τίθεσαν εὐερκέος αὐλῆς, ἀλλήλοισιν ἐρείδουσαι· σήμαινε δʼ Ὀδυσσεὺς αὐτὸς ἐπισπέρχων· ταὶ δʼ ἐκφόρεον καὶ ἀνάγκῃ. αὐτὰρ ἔπειτα θρόνους περικαλλέας ἠδὲ τραπέζας ὕδατι καὶ σπόγγοισι πολυτρήτοισι κάθαιρον. αὐτὰρ Τηλέμαχος καὶ βουκόλος ἠδὲ συβώτῃς λίστροισιν δάπεδον πύκα ποιητοῖο δόμοιο ξῦον· ταὶ δʼ ἐφόρεον δμῳαί, τίθεσαν δὲ θύραζε. αὐτὰρ ἐπειδὴ πᾶν μέγαρον διεκοσμήσαντο, δμῳὰς δʼ ἐξαγαγόντες ἐϋσταθέος μεγάροιο, μεσσηγύς τε θόλου καὶ ἀμύμονος ἕρκεος αὐλῆς, εἴλεον ἐν στείνει, ὅθεν οὔ πως ἦεν ἀλύξαι. τοῖσι δὲ Τηλέμαχος πεπνυμένος ἦρχʼ ἀγορεύειν· μὴ μὲν δὴ καθαρῷ θανάτῳ ἀπὸ θυμὸν ἑλοίμην τάων, αἳ δὴ ἐμῇ κεφαλῇ κατʼ ὀνείδεα χεῦαν μητέρι θʼ ἡμετέρῃ παρά τε μνηστῆρσιν ἴαυον.
So saying he made a ship's cable fast to one of the bearing-posts that supported the roof of the domed room, and secured it all around the building, at a good height, lest any of the women's feet should touch the ground; and as thrushes or doves beat against a net that has been set for them in a thicket just as they were getting to their nest, and a terrible fate awaits them, even so did the women have to put their heads in nooses one after the other and die most miserably. Their feet moved convulsively for a while, but not for very long.	ὣς ἄρʼ ἔφη, καὶ πεῖσμα νεὸς κυανοπρῴροιο κίονος ἐξάψας μεγάλης περίβαλλε θόλοιο, ὑψόσʼ ἐπεντανύσας, μή τις ποσὶν οὖδας ἵκοιτο. ὡς δʼ ὅτʼ ἂν ἢ κίχλαι τανυσίπτεροι ἠὲ πέλειαι ἕρκει ἐνιπλήξωσι, τό θʼ ἑστήκῃ ἐνὶ θάμνῳ, αὖλιν ἐσιέμεναι, στυγερὸς δʼ ὑπεδέξατο κοῖτος, ὣς αἵ γʼ ἑξείης κεφαλὰς ἔχον, ἀμφὶ δὲ πάσαις δειρῇσι βρόχοι ἦσαν, ὅπως οἴκτιστα θάνοιεν. ἤσπαιρον δὲ πόδεσσι μίνυνθά περ οὔ τι μάλα δήν.
As for Melanthios, they took him through the room into the inner court. There they cut off his nose and his ears; they drew out his vitals and gave them to the dogs raw, and then in their fury they cut off his hands and his feet.	ἐκ δὲ Μελάνθιον ἦγον ἀνὰ πρόθυρόν τε καὶ αὐλήν· τοῦ δʼ ἀπὸ μὲν ῥῖνάς τε καὶ οὔατα νηλέϊ χαλκῷ τάμνον, μήδεά τʼ ἐξέρυσαν, κυσὶν ὠμὰ δάσασθαι, χεῖράς τʼ ἠδὲ πόδας κόπτον κεκοτηότι θυμῷ.
"When they had done this they washed their hands and feet and went back into the house, for all was now over; and Odysseus said to the dear old nurse Eurykleia, ""Bring me sulfur, which cleanses all pollution, and fetch fire also that I may burn it, and purify the cloisters. Go, moreover, and tell Penelope to come here with her attendants, and also all the maid servants that are in the house."""	οἱ μὲν ἔπειτʼ ἀπονιψάμενοι χεῖράς τε πόδας τε εἰς Ὀδυσῆα δόμονδε κίον, τετέλεστο δὲ ἔργον· αὐτὰρ ὅ γε προσέειπε φίλην τροφὸν Εὐρύκλειαν· οἶσε θέειον, γρηΰ, κακῶν ἄκος, οἶσε δέ μοι πῦρ, ὄφρα θεειώσω μέγαρον· σὺ δὲ Πηνελόπειαν ἐλθεῖν ἐνθάδʼ ἄνωχθι σὺν ἀμφιπόλοισι γυναιξί· πάσας δʼ ὄτρυνον δμῳὰς κατὰ δῶμα νέεσθαι.
"""All that you have said is true,"" answered Eurykleia, ""but let me bring you some clean clothes - a shirt and cloak. Do not keep these rags on your back any longer. It is not right."""	τὸν δʼ αὖτε προσέειπε φίλη τροφὸς Εὐρύκλεια· ναὶ δὴ ταῦτά γε, τέκνον ἐμόν, κατὰ μοῖραν ἔειπες. ἀλλʼ ἄγε τοι χλαῖνάν τε χιτῶνά τε εἵματʼ ἐνείκω, μηδʼ οὕτω ῥάκεσιν πεπυκασμένος εὐρέας ὤμους ἕσταθʼ ἐνὶ μεγάροισι· νεμεσσητὸν δέ κεν εἴη.
"""First light me a fire,"" replied Odysseus."	τὴν δʼ ἀπαμειβόμενος προσέφη πολύμητις Ὀδυσσεύς· πῦρ νῦν μοι πρώτιστον ἐνὶ μεγάροισι γενέσθω.
She brought the fire and sulfur, as he had bidden her, and Odysseus thoroughly purified the cloisters and both the inner and outer courts. Then she went inside to call the women and tell them what had happened; whereon they came from their apartment with torches in their hands, and pressed round Odysseus to embrace him, kissing his head and shoulders and taking hold of his hands. It made him feel as if he should like to weep, for he remembered every one of them.	ὣς ἔφατʼ, οὐδʼ ἀπίθησε φίλη τροφὸς Εὐρύκλεια, ἤνεικεν δʼ ἄρα πῦρ καὶ θήϊον· αὐτὰρ Ὀδυσσεὺς εὖ διεθείωσεν μέγαρον καὶ δῶμα καὶ αὐλήν. γρηῢς δʼ αὖτʼ ἀπέβη διὰ δώματα κάλʼ Ὀδυσῆος ἀγγελέουσα γυναιξὶ καὶ ὀτρυνέουσα νέεσθαι· αἱ δʼ ἴσαν ἐκ μεγάροιο δάος μετὰ χερσὶν ἔχουσαι. αἱ μὲν ἄρʼ ἀμφεχέοντο καὶ ἠσπάζοντʼ Ὀδυσῆα, καὶ κύνεον ἀγαπαξόμεναι κεφαλήν τε καὶ ὤμους χεῖράς τʼ αἰνύμεναι· τὸν δὲ γλυκὺς ἵμερος ᾕρει
"Eurykleia now went upstairs laughing to tell her mistress that her dear husband had come home. Her aged knees became young again and her feet were nimble for joy as she went up to her mistress and bent over her head to speak to her. ""Wake up Penelope, my dear child,"" she exclaimed, ""and see with your own eyes something that you have been wanting this long time past. Odysseus has at last indeed come home again, and has killed the suitors who were giving so much trouble in his house, eating up his estate and ill-treating his son."""	γρηῢς δʼ εἰς ὑπερῷʼ ἀνεβήσετο καγχαλόωσα, δεσποίνῃ ἐρέουσα φίλον πόσιν ἔνδον ἐόντα· γούνατα δʼ ἐρρώσαντο, πόδες δʼ ὑπερικταίνοντο. στῆ δʼ ἄρʼ ὑπὲρ κεφαλῆς καί μιν πρὸς μῦθον ἔειπεν· ἔγρεο, Πηνελόπεια, φίλον τέκος, ὄφρα ἴδηαι ὀφθαλμοῖσι τεοῖσι τά τʼ ἔλδεαι ἤματα πάντα. ἦλθʼ Ὀδυσεὺς καὶ οἶκον ἱκάνεται, ὀψέ περ ἐλθών. μνηστῆρας δʼ ἔκτεινεν ἀγήνορας, οἵ θʼ ἑὸν οἶκον κήδεσκον καὶ κτήματʼ ἔδον βιόωντό τε παῖδα.
"""My good nurse,"" answered Penelope, ""you must be mad. The gods sometimes send some very sensible people out of their minds, and make foolish people become sensible. This is what they must have been doing to you; for you always used to be a reasonable person. Why should you thus mock me when I have trouble enough already - talking such nonsense, and waking me up out of a sweet sleep that had taken possession of my eyes and closed them? I have never slept so soundly from the day my poor husband went to that city with the ill-omened name. Go back again into the women's room; if it had been any one else, who had woke me up to bring me such absurd news I should have sent her away with a severe scolding. As it is, your age shall protect you."""	τὴν δʼ αὖτε προσέειπε περίφρων Πηνελόπεια· μαῖα φίλη, μάργην σε θεοὶ θέσαν, οἵ τε δύνανται ἄφρονα ποιῆσαι καὶ ἐπίφρονά περ μάλʼ ἐόντα, καί τε χαλιφρονέοντα σαοφροσύνης ἐπέβησαν· οἵ σέ περ ἔβλαψαν· πρὶν δὲ φρένας αἰσίμη ἦσθα. τίπτε με λωβεύεις πολυπενθέα θυμὸν ἔχουσαν ταῦτα παρὲξ ἐρέουσα καὶ ἐξ ὕπνου μʼ ἀνεγείρεις ἡδέος, ὅς μʼ ἐπέδησε φίλα βλέφαρʼ ἀμφικαλύψας; οὐ γάρ πω τοιόνδε κατέδραθον, ἐξ οὗ Ὀδυσσεὺς ᾤχετʼ ἐποψόμενος Κακοΐλιον οὐκ ὀνομαστήν. ἀλλʼ ἄγε νῦν κατάβηθι καὶ ἂψ ἔρχευ μέγαρόνδε. εἰ γάρ τίς μʼ ἄλλη γε γυναικῶν, αἵ μοι ἔασι, ταῦτʼ ἐλθοῦσʼ ἤγγειλε καὶ ἐξ ὕπνου ἀνέγειρεν, τῷ κε τάχα στυγερῶς μιν ἐγὼν ἀπέπεμψα νέεσθαι αὖτις ἔσω μέγαρον· σὲ δὲ τοῦτό γε γῆρας ὀνήσει.
"""My dear child,"" answered Eurykleia, ""I am not mocking you. It is quite true as I tell you that Odysseus is come home again. He was the stranger whom they all kept on treating so badly in the room. Telemakhos knew all the time that he was come back, but kept his father's secret that he might have his revenge on all these wicked people."	τὴν δʼ αὖτε προσέειπε φίλη τροφὸς Εὐρύκλεια· οὔ τί σε λωβεύω, τέκνον φίλον, ἀλλʼ ἔτυμόν τοι ἦλθʼ Ὀδυσεὺς καὶ οἶκον ἱκάνεται, ὡς ἀγορεύω, ὁ ξεῖνος, τὸν πάντες ἀτίμων ἐν μεγάροισι.

"Then Penelope sprang up from her couch, threw her arms round Eurykleia, and wept for joy. ""But my dear nurse,"" said she, ""explain this to me; if he has really come home as you say, how did he manage to overcome the wicked suitors single handed, seeing what a number of them there always were?"""	ὣς ἔφαθʼ, ἡ δʼ ἐχάρη καὶ ἀπὸ λέκτροιο θοροῦσα γρηῒ περιπλέχθη, βλεφάρων δʼ ἀπὸ δάκρυον ἧκεν· καί μιν φωνήσασʼ ἔπεα πτερόεντα προσηύδα· εἰ δʼ ἄγε δή μοι, μαῖα φίλη, νημερτὲς ἐνίσπες, εἰ ἐτεὸν δὴ οἶκον ἱκάνεται, ὡς ἀγορεύεις, ὅππως δὴ μνηστῆρσιν ἀναιδέσι χεῖρας ἐφῆκε μοῦνος ἐών, οἱ δʼ αἰὲν ἀολλέες ἔνδον ἔμιμνον.
"""I was not there,"" answered Eurykleia, ""and do not know; I only heard them groaning while they were being killed. We sat crouching and huddled up in a corner of the women's room with the doors closed, till your son came to fetch me because his father sent him. Then I found Odysseus standing over the corpses that were lying on the ground all round him, one on top of the other. You would have enjoyed it if you could have seen him standing there all bespattered with blood and filth, and looking just like a lion. But the corpses are now all piled up in the gatehouse that is in the outer court, and Odysseus has lit a great fire to purify the house with sulfur. He has sent me to call you, so come with me that you may both be happy together after all; for now at last the desire of your heart has been fulfilled; your husband is come home to find both wife and son alive and well, and to take his revenge in his own house on the suitors who behaved so badly to him."""	τὴν δʼ αὖτε προσέειπε φίλη τροφὸς Εὐρύκλεια· οὐκ ἴδον, οὐ πυθόμην, ἀλλὰ στόνον οἶον ἄκουσα κτεινομένων· ἡμεῖς δὲ μυχῷ θαλάμων εὐπήκτων ἥμεθʼ ἀτυζόμεναι, σανίδες δʼ ἔχον εὖ ἀραρυῖαι, πρίν γʼ ὅτε δή με σὸς υἱὸς ἀπὸ μεγάροιο κάλεσσε Τηλέμαχος· τὸν γάρ ῥα πατὴρ προέηκε καλέσσαι. εὗρον ἔπειτʼ Ὀδυσῆα μετὰ κταμένοισι νέκυσσιν ἑσταόθʼ· οἱ δέ μιν ἀμφί, κραταίπεδον οὖδας ἔχοντες, κείατʼ ἐπʼ ἀλλήλοισιν· ἰδοῦσά κε θυμὸν ἰάνθης. νῦν δʼ οἱ μὲν δὴ πάντες ἐπʼ αὐλείῃσι θύρῃσιν ἀθρόοι, αὐτὰρ ὁ δῶμα θεειοῦται περικαλλές, πῦρ μέγα κηάμενος· σὲ δέ με προέηκε καλέσσαι. ἀλλʼ ἕπευ, ὄφρα σφῶϊν ἐϋφροσύνης ἐπιβῆτον ἀμφοτέρω φίλον ἦτορ, ἐπεὶ κακὰ πολλὰ πέποσθε. νῦν δʼ ἤδη τόδε μακρὸν ἐέλδωρ ἐκτετέλεσται· ἦλθε μὲν αὐτὸς ζωὸς ἐφέστιος, εὗρε δὲ καὶ σὲ καὶ παῖδʼ ἐν μεγάροισι· κακῶς δʼ οἵ πέρ μιν ἔρεζον μνηστῆρες, τοὺς πάντας ἐτίσατο ᾧ ἐνὶ οἴκῳ.
"""‘My dear nurse,"" said Penelope, ""do not exult too confidently over all this. You know how delighted every one would be to see Odysseus come home - more particularly myself, and the son who has been born to both of us; but what you tell me cannot be really true. It is some god who is angry with the suitors for their great wickedness  , and has made an end of them; for they respected no man in the whole world, neither rich nor poor, who came near them, who came near them, and they have come to a bad end in consequence of their iniquity. Odysseus is dead far away from the Achaean land; he will never return home again  ."""	τὴν δʼ αὖτε προσέειπε περίφρων Πηνελόπεια· μαῖα φίλη, μή πω μέγʼ ἐπεύχεο καγχαλόωσα. οἶσθα γὰρ ὥς κʼ ἀσπαστὸς ἐνὶ μεγάροισι φανείη πᾶσι, μάλιστα δʼ ἐμοί τε καὶ υἱέϊ, τὸν τεκόμεσθα· ἀλλʼ οὐκ ἔσθʼ ὅδε μῦθος ἐτήτυμος, ὡς ἀγορεύεις, ἀλλά τις ἀθανάτων κτεῖνε μνηστῆρας ἀγαυούς, ὕβριν ἀγασσάμενος θυμαλγέα καὶ κακὰ ἔργα. οὔ τινα γὰρ τίεσκον ἐπιχθονίων ἀνθρώπων, οὐ κακὸν οὐδὲ μὲν ἐσθλόν, ὅτις σφέας εἰσαφίκοιτο· τῷ διʼ ἀτασθαλίας ἔπαθον κακόν· αὐτὰρ Ὀδυσσεὺς ὤλεσε τηλοῦ νόστον Ἀχαιΐδος, ὤλετο δʼ αὐτός.
"Then nurse Eurykleia said, ""My child, what are you talking about? But you were all hard of belief and have made up your mind that your husband is never coming, although he is in the house and by his own fire side at this very moment. Besides I can give you another proof  ; when I was washing him I perceived the scar which the wild boar gave him, and I wanted to tell you about it, but in his wisdom   he would not let me, and clapped his hands over my mouth; so come with me and I will make this bargain with you - if I am deceiving you, you may have me killed by the cruelest death you can think of."""	τὴν δʼ ἠμείβετʼ ἔπειτα φίλη τροφὸς Εὐρύκλεια· τέκνον ἐμόν, ποῖόν σε ἔπος φύγεν ἕρκος ὀδόντων, ἣ πόσιν ἔνδον ἐόντα παρʼ ἐσχάρῃ οὔ ποτʼ ἔφησθα οἴκαδʼ ἐλεύσεσθαι· θυμὸς δέ τοι αἰὲν ἄπιστος. ἀλλʼ ἄγε τοι καὶ σῆμα ἀριφραδὲς ἄλλο τι εἴπω, οὐλήν, τήν ποτέ μιν σῦς ἤλασε λευκῷ ὀδόντι. τὴν ἀπονίζουσα φρασάμην, ἔθελον δὲ σοὶ αὐτῇ εἰπέμεν· ἀλλά με κεῖνος ἑλὼν ἐπὶ μάστακα χερσὶν οὐκ ἔα εἰπέμεναι πολυϊδρείῃσι νόοιο. ἀλλʼ ἕπευ· αὐτὰρ ἐγὼν ἐμέθεν περιδώσομαι αὐτῆς, αἴ κέν σʼ ἐξαπάφω, κτεῖναί μʼ οἰκτίστῳ ὀλέθρῳ.
"""My dear nurse,"" said Penelope, ""however wise you may be you can hardly fathom the counsels of the gods. Nevertheless, we will go in search of my son, that I may see the corpses of the suitors, and the man who has killed them."""	τὴν δʼ ἠμείβετʼ ἔπειτα περίφρων Πηνελόπεια· μαῖα φίλη, χαλεπόν σε θεῶν αἰειγενετάων δήνεα εἴρυσθαι, μὰλα περ πολύϊδριν ἐοῦσαν. ἀλλʼ ἔμπης ἴομεν μετὰ παῖδʼ ἐμόν, ὄφρα ἴδωμαι ἄνδρας μνηστῆρας τεθνηότας, ἠδʼ ὃς ἔπεφνεν.
On this she came down from her upper room, and while doing so she considered whether she should keep at a distance from her husband and question him, or whether she should at once go up to him and embrace him. When, however, she had crossed the stone floor of the room, she sat down opposite Odysseus by the fire, against the wall at right angles to that by which she had entered, while Odysseus sat near one of the bearing-posts, looking upon the ground, and waiting to see what his wife would say to him when she saw him. For a long time she sat silent and as one lost in amazement. At one moment she looked him full in the face, but then again directly, she was misled by his shabby clothes and failed to recognize him, till Telemakhos began to reproach her and said:	ὣς φαμένη κατέβαινʼ ὑπερώϊα· πολλὰ δέ οἱ κῆρ ὥρμαινʼ, ἢ ἀπάνευθε φίλον πόσιν ἐξερεείνοι, ἦ παρστᾶσα κύσειε κάρη καὶ χεῖρε λαβοῦσα. ἡ δʼ ἐπεὶ εἰσῆλθεν καὶ ὑπέρβη λάϊνον οὐδόν, ἕζετʼ ἔπειτʼ Ὀδυσῆος ἐναντίη, ἐν πυρὸς αὐγῇ, τοίχου τοῦ ἑτέρου· ὁ δʼ ἄρα πρὸς κίονα μακρὴν ἧστο κάτω ὁρόων, ποτιδέγμενος εἴ τί μιν εἴποι ἰφθίμη παράκοιτις, ἐπεὶ ἴδεν ὀφθαλμοῖσιν. ἡ δʼ ἄνεω δὴν ἧστο, τάφος δέ οἱ ἦτορ ἵκανεν· ὄψει δʼ ἄλλοτε μέν μιν ἐνωπαδίως ἐσίδεσκεν, ἄλλοτε δʼ ἀγνώσασκε κακὰ χροῒ εἵματʼ ἔχοντα.

"""Mother - but you are so hard that I cannot call you by such a name - why do you keep away from my father in this way? Why do you not sit by his side and begin talking to him and asking him questions?

"Penelope answered, ""My son, I am so lost in astonishment that I can find no words in which either to ask questions or to answer them. I cannot even look him straight in the face. Still, if he really is Odysseus come back to his own home again, we shall get to understand one another better by and by, for there are tokens   with which we two are alone acquainted, and which are hidden from all others."""	τὸν δʼ αὖτε προσέειπε περίφρων Πηνελόπεια· τέκνον ἐμόν, θυμός μοι ἐνὶ στήθεσσι τέθηπεν, οὐδέ τι προσφάσθαι δύναμαι ἔπος οὐδʼ ἐρέεσθαι οὐδʼ εἰς ὦπα ἰδέσθαι ἐναντίον. εἰ δʼ ἐτεὸν δὴ ἔστʼ Ὀδυσεὺς καὶ οἶκον ἱκάνεται, ἦ μάλα νῶϊ γνωσόμεθʼ ἀλλήλων καὶ λώϊον· ἔστι γὰρ ἡμῖν σήμαθʼ, ἃ δὴ καὶ νῶϊ κεκρυμμένα ἴδμεν ἀπʼ ἄλλων.
"Odysseus smiled at this, and said to Telemakhos, ""Let your mother put me to any proof she likes; she will make up her mind about it presently. She rejects me for the moment and believes me to be somebody else, because I am covered with dirt and have such bad clothes on; let us, however, consider what we had better do next. When one man has killed another in a , even though he was not one who would leave many friends to take up his quarrel, the man who has killed him must still say good bye to his friends and flee the country; whereas we have been killing the stay of a whole city, and all the picked youth of Ithaca . I would have you consider this matter."""	ὣς φάτο, μείδησεν δὲ πολύτλας δῖος Ὀδυσσεύς, αἶψα δὲ Τηλέμαχον ἔπεα πτερόεντα προσηύδα· Τηλέμαχʼ, ἦ τοι μητέρʼ ἐνὶ μεγάροισιν ἔασον πειράζειν ἐμέθεν· τάχα δὲ φράσεται καὶ ἄρειον. νῦν δʼ ὅττι ῥυπόω, κακὰ δὲ χροῒ εἵματα εἷμαι, τοὔνεκʼ ἀτιμάζει με καὶ οὔ πω φησὶ τὸν εἶναι. ἡμεῖς δὲ φραζώμεθʼ ὅπως ὄχʼ ἄριστα γένηται. καὶ γάρ τίς θʼ ἕνα φῶτα κατακτείνας ἐνὶ δήμῳ, ᾧ μὴ πολλοὶ ἔωσιν ἀοσσητῆρες ὀπίσσω, φεύγει πηούς τε προλιπὼν καὶ πατρίδα γαῖαν· ἡμεῖς δʼ ἕρμα πόληος ἀπέκταμεν, οἳ μέγʼ ἄριστοι κούρων εἰν Ἰθάκῃ· τὰ δέ σε φράζεσθαι ἄνωγα.
"""Look to it yourself, father,"" answered Telemakhos, ""for they say you are the wisest counselor in the world, and that there is no other mortal man who can compare with you. We will follow you with right good will, nor shall you find us fail you in so far as our strength holds out."""	τὸν δʼ αὖ Τηλέμαχος πεπνυμένος ἀντίον ηὔδα· αὐτὸς ταῦτά γε λεῦσσε, πάτερ φίλε· σὴν γὰρ ἀρίστην μῆτιν ἐπʼ ἀνθρώπους φάσʼ ἔμμεναι, οὐδέ κέ τίς τοι ἄλλος ἀνὴρ ἐρίσειε καταθνητῶν ἀνθρώπων. ἡμεῖς δʼ ἐμμεμαῶτες ἅμʼ ἑψόμεθʼ, οὐδέ τί φημι ἀλκῆς δευήσεσθαι, ὅση δύναμίς γε πάρεστιν.
"""I will say what I think will be best,"" answered Odysseus. ""First wash and put your shirts on; tell the maids also to go to their own room and dress; Phemios shall then strike up a dance tune on his lyre, so that if people outside hear, or any of the neighbors, or some one going along the street happens to notice it, they may think there is a wedding in the house, and no rumors   about the death of the suitors will get about in the town, before we can escape to the woods upon my own land. Once there, we will settle which of the courses of action   heaven grants us shall seem wisest."""	τὸν δʼ ἀπαμειβόμενος προσέφη πολύμητις Ὀδυσσεύς τοιγὰρ ἐγὼν ἐρέω ὥς μοι δοκεῖ εἶναι ἄριστα. πρῶτα μὲν ἂρ λούσασθε καὶ ἀμφιέσασθε χιτῶνας, δμῳὰς δʼ ἐν μεγάροισιν ἀνώγετε εἵμαθʼ ἑλέσθαι· αὐτὰρ θεῖος ἀοιδὸς ἔχων φόρμιγγα λίγειαν ἡμῖν ἡγείσθω φιλοπαίγμονος ὀρχηθμοῖο, ὥς κέν τις φαίη γάμον ἔμμεναι ἐκτὸς ἀκούων, ἢ ἀνʼ ὁδὸν στείχων, ἢ οἳ περιναιετάουσι· μὴ πρόσθε κλέος εὐρὺ φόνου κατὰ ἄστυ γένηται ἀνδρῶν μνηστήρων, πρίν γʼ ἡμέας ἐλθέμεν ἔξω ἀγρὸν ἐς ἡμέτερον πολυδένδρεον· ἔνθα δʼ ἔπειτα φρασσόμεθʼ ὅττι κε κέρδος Ὀλύμπιος ἐγγυαλίξῃ.
"Thus did he speak, and they did even as he had said. First they washed and put their shirts on, while the women got ready. Then Phemios took his lyre and set them all longing for sweet song and stately dance. The house re-echoed with the sound of men and women dancing, and the people outside said, ""I suppose the queen has been getting married at last. She ought to be ashamed of herself for not continuing to protect her husband's property until he comes home."""	ὣς ἔφαθʼ, οἱ δʼ ἄρα τοῦ μάλα μὲν κλύον ἠδʼ ἐπίθοντο πρῶτα μὲν οὖν λούσαντο καὶ ἀμφιέσαντο χιτῶνας, ὅπλισθεν δὲ γυναῖκες· ὁ δʼ εἵλετο θεῖος ἀοιδὸς φόρμιγγα γλαφυρήν, ἐν δέ σφισιν ἵμερον ὦρσε μολπῆς τε γλυκερῆς καὶ ἀμύμονος ὀρχηθμοῖο. τοῖσιν δὲ μέγα δῶμα περιστεναχίζετο ποσσὶν ἀνδρῶν παιζόντων καλλιζώνων τε γυναικῶν. ὧδε δέ τις εἴπεσκε δόμων ἔκτοσθεν ἀκούων· ἦ μάλα δή τις ἔγημε πολυμνήστην βασίλειαν· σχετλίη, οὐδʼ ἔτλη πόσιος οὗ κουριδίοιο εἴρυσθαι μέγα δῶμα διαμπερές, ἧος ἵκοιτο.
"This was what they said, but they did not know what it was that had been happening. The upper servant Eurynome washed and anointed Odysseus in his own house and gave him a shirt and cloak, while Athena made him look taller and stronger than before; she also made the hair grow thick on the top of his head, and flow down in curls like hyacinth blossoms; she shed about his head and shoulders just as a skillful workman who has studied art of all kinds under Hephaistos or Athena - and his work is full of - enriches a piece of silver plate by gilding it. He came from the bath looking like one of the immortals, and sat down opposite his wife on the seat he had left. ""My dear,"" said he, ""heaven has endowed you with a heart more unyielding than woman ever yet had. No other woman could bear to keep away from her husband when he had come back to her after twenty years of absence, and after having gone through so much. But come, nurse, get a bed ready for me; I will sleep alone, for this woman has a heart as hard as iron."""	ὣς ἄρα τις εἴπεσκε, τὰ δʼ οὐκ ἴσαν ὡς ἐτέτυκτο. αὐτὰρ Ὀδυσσῆα μεγαλήτορα ᾧ ἐνὶ οἴκῳ Εὐρυνόμη ταμίη λοῦσεν καὶ χρῖσεν ἐλαίῳ, ἀμφὶ δέ μιν φᾶρος καλὸν βάλεν ἠδὲ χιτῶνα· αὐτὰρ κὰκ κεφαλῆς κάλλος πολὺ χεῦεν Ἀθήνη μείζονά τʼ εἰσιδέειν καὶ πάσσονα· κὰδ δὲ κάρητος οὔλας ἧκε κόμας, ὑακινθίνῳ ἄνθει ὁμοίας. ὡς δʼ ὅτε τις χρυσὸν περιχεύεται ἀργύρῳ ἀνὴρ ἴδρις, ὃν Ἥφαιστος δέδαεν καὶ Παλλὰς Ἀθήνη τέχνην παντοίην, χαρίεντα δὲ ἔργα τελείει· ὣς μὲν τῷ περίχευε χάριν κεφαλῇ τε καὶ ὤμοις. ἐκ δʼ ἀσαμίνθου βῆ δέμας ἀθανάτοισιν ὁμοῖος· ἂψ δʼ αὖτις κατʼ ἄρʼ ἕζετʼ ἐπὶ θρόνου ἔνθεν ἀνέστη, ἀντίον ἧς ἀλόχου, καί μιν πρὸς μῦθον ἔειπε· δαιμονίη, περί σοί γε γυναικῶν θηλυτεράων κῆρ ἀτέραμνον ἔθηκαν Ὀλύμπια δώματʼ ἔχοντες· οὐ μέν κʼ ἄλλη γʼ ὧδε γυνὴ τετληότι θυμῷ ἀνδρὸς ἀφεσταίη, ὅς οἱ κακὰ πολλὰ μογήσας ἔλθοι ἐεικοστῷ ἔτεϊ ἐς πατρίδα γαῖαν. ἀλλʼ ἄγε μοι, μαῖα, στόρεσον λέχος, ὄφρα καὶ αὐτὸς λέξομαι· ἦ γὰρ τῇ γε σιδήρεον ἐν φρεσὶ ἦτορ.
"""My dear,"" answered Penelope, ""I have no wish to set myself up, nor to depreciate you; but I am not struck by your appearance, for I very well remember what kind of a man you were when you set sail from Ithaca . Nevertheless, Eurykleia, take his bed outside the bed chamber that he himself built. Bring the bed outside this room, and put bedding upon it with fleeces, good coverlets, and blankets."""	τὸν δʼ αὖτε προσέειπε περίφρων Πηνελόπεια· δαιμόνιʼ, οὔτʼ ἄρ τι μεγαλίζομαι οὔτʼ ἀθερίζω οὔτε λίην ἄγαμαι, μάλα δʼ εὖ οἶδʼ οἷος ἔησθα ἐξ Ἰθάκης ἐπὶ νηὸς ἰὼν δολιχηρέτμοιο. ἀλλʼ ἄγε οἱ στόρεσον πυκινὸν λέχος, Εὐρύκλεια, ἐκτὸς ἐϋσταθέος θαλάμου, τόν ῥʼ αὐτὸς ἐποίει· ἔνθα οἱ ἐκθεῖσαι πυκινὸν λέχος ἐμβάλετʼ εὐνήν, κώεα καὶ χλαίνας καὶ ῥήγεα σιγαλόεντα.
"She said this to try him, but Odysseus was very angry and said, ""Wife, I am much displeased at what you have just been saying. Who has been taking my bed from the place in which I left it? He must have found it a hard task, no matter how skilled a workman he was, unless some god came and helped him to shift it. There is no man living, however strong and in his prime, who could move it from its place. For it was wrought to be a great sign  ; it is a marvelous curiosity which I made with my very own hands. There was a young olive growing within the precincts of the house, in full vigor, and about as thick as a bearing-post. I built my room round this with strong walls of stone and a roof to cover them, and I made the doors strong and well-fitting. Then I cut off the top boughs of the olive tree and left the stump standing. This I dressed roughly from the root upwards and then worked with carpenter's tools well and skillfully, straightening my work by drawing a line on the wood, and making it into a bed-prop. I then bored a hole down the middle, and made it the center-post of my bed, at which I worked till I had finished it, inlaying it with gold and silver; after this I stretched a hide of crimson leather from one side of it to the other. So you see I know all about this sign  , and I desire to learn whether it is still there, or whether any one has been removing it by cutting down the olive tree at its roots."""	ὣς ἄρʼ ἔφη πόσιος πειρωμένη· αὐτὰρ Ὀδυσσεὺς ὀχθήσας ἄλοχον προσεφώνεε κεδνὰ ἰδυῖαν· ὦ γύναι, ἦ μάλα τοῦτο ἔπος θυμαλγὲς ἔειπες· τίς δέ μοι ἄλλοσε θῆκε λέχος; χαλεπὸν δέ κεν εἴη καὶ μάλʼ ἐπισταμένῳ, ὅτε μὴ θεὸς αὐτὸς ἐπελθὼν ῥηϊδίως ἐθέλων θείη ἄλλῃ ἐνὶ χώρῃ. ἀνδρῶν δʼ οὔ κέν τις ζωὸς βροτός, οὐδὲ μάλʼ ἡβῶν, ῥεῖα μετοχλίσσειεν, ἐπεὶ μέγα σῆμα τέτυκται ἐν λέχει ἀσκητῷ· τὸ δʼ ἐγὼ κάμον οὐδέ τις ἄλλος. θάμνος ἔφυ τανύφυλλος ἐλαίης ἕρκεος ἐντός, ἀκμηνὸς θαλέθων· πάχετος δʼ ἦν ἠΰτε κίων. τῷ δʼ ἐγὼ ἀμφιβαλὼν θάλαμον δέμον, ὄφρʼ ἐτέλεσσα, πυκνῇσιν λιθάδεσσι, καὶ εὖ καθύπερθεν ἔρεψα, κολλητὰς δʼ ἐπέθηκα θύρας, πυκινῶς ἀραρυίας. καὶ τότʼ ἔπειτʼ ἀπέκοψα κόμην τανυφύλλου ἐλαίης, κορμὸν δʼ ἐκ ῥίζης προταμὼν ἀμφέξεσα χαλκῷ εὖ καὶ ἐπισταμένως, καὶ ἐπὶ στάθμην ἴθυνα, ἑρμῖνʼ ἀσκήσας, τέτρηνα δὲ πάντα τερέτρῳ. ἐκ δὲ τοῦ ἀρχόμενος λέχος ἔξεον, ὄφρʼ ἐτέλεσσα, δαιδάλλων χρυσῷ τε καὶ ἀργύρῳ ἠδʼ ἐλέφαντι· ἐκ δʼ ἐτάνυσσα ἱμάντα βοὸς φοίνικι φαεινόν. οὕτω τοι τόδε σῆμα πιφαύσκομαι· οὐδέ τι οἶδα, ἤ μοι ἔτʼ ἔμπεδόν ἐστι, γύναι, λέχος, ἦέ τις ἤδη ἀνδρῶν ἄλλοσε θῆκε, ταμὼν ὕπο πυθμένʼ ἐλαίης.
"When she heard the sure proofs   Odysseus now gave her, she fairly broke down. She flew weeping to his side, flung her arms about his neck, and kissed him. ""Do not be angry with me Odysseus,"" she cried, ""you, who are the wisest of humankind. We have suffered, both of us. Heaven has denied us the happiness of spending our youth, and of growing old, together; do not then be aggrieved or take it amiss that I did not embrace you thus as soon as I saw you. I have been shuddering all the time through fear that someone might come here and deceive me with a lying story; for there are many people who plan wicked schemes  . Zeus’ daughter Helen would never have yielded herself to a man from a foreign country, if she had known that the sons of Achaeans would come after her and bring her back. Heaven put it in her heart to do wrong, and she gave no thought to that transgression  , which has been the source of all our sorrows  . Now, however, that you have convinced me by showing that you know all the proofs   of our bed (which no human being has ever seen but you and I and a single maid servant, the daughter of Aktor, who was given me by my father on my marriage, and who keeps the doors of our room), hard of belief though I have been, I can mistrust no longer."""	ὣς φάτο, τῆς δʼ αὐτοῦ λύτο γούνατα καὶ φίλον ἦτορ, σήματʼ ἀναγνούσῃ τά οἱ ἔμπεδα πέφραδʼ Ὀδυσσεύς· δακρύσασα δʼ ἔπειτʼ ἰθὺς δράμεν, ἀμφὶ δὲ χεῖρας δειρῇ βάλλʼ Ὀδυσῆϊ, κάρη δʼ ἔκυσʼ ἠδὲ προσηύδα· μή μοι, Ὀδυσσεῦ, σκύζευ, ἐπεὶ τά περ ἄλλα μάλιστα ἀνθρώπων πέπνυσο· θεοὶ δʼ ὤπαζον ὀϊζύν, οἳ νῶϊν ἀγάσαντο παρʼ ἀλλήλοισι μένοντε ἥβης ταρπῆναι καὶ γήραος οὐδὸν ἱκέσθαι. αὐτὰρ μὴ νῦν μοι τόδε χώεο μηδὲ νεμέσσα, οὕνεκά σʼ οὐ τὸ πρῶτον, ἐπεὶ ἴδον, ὧδʼ ἀγάπησα. αἰεὶ γάρ μοι θυμὸς ἐνὶ στήθεσσι φίλοισιν ἐρρίγει μή τίς με βροτῶν ἀπάφοιτο ἔπεσσιν ἐλθών· πολλοὶ γὰρ κακὰ κέρδεα βουλεύουσιν. οὐδέ κεν Ἀργείη Ἑλένη, Διὸς ἐκγεγαυῖα, ἀνδρὶ παρʼ ἀλλοδαπῷ ἐμίγη φιλότητι καὶ εὐνῇ, εἰ ᾔδη ὅ μιν αὖτις ἀρήϊοι υἷες Ἀχαιῶν ἀξέμεναι οἶκόνδε φίλην ἐς πατρίδʼ ἔμελλον. τὴν δʼ ἦ τοι ῥέξαι θεὸς ὤρορεν ἔργον ἀεικές· τὴν δʼ ἄτην οὐ πρόσθεν ἑῷ ἐγκάτθετο θυμῷ λυγρήν, ἐξ ἧς πρῶτα καὶ ἡμέας ἵκετο πένθος. νῦν δʼ, ἐπεὶ ἤδη σήματʼ ἀριφραδέα κατέλεξας εὐνῆς ἡμετέρης, ἣν οὐ βροτὸς ἄλλος ὀπώπει, ἀλλʼ οἶοι σύ τʼ ἐγώ τε καὶ ἀμφίπολος μία μούνη, Ἀκτορίς, ἥν μοι δῶκε πατὴρ ἔτι δεῦρο κιούσῃ, ἣ νῶϊν εἴρυτο θύρας πυκινοῦ θαλάμοιο, πείθεις δή μευ θυμόν, ἀπηνέα περ μάλʼ ἐόντα.
Then Odysseus in his turn melted, and wept as he clasped his dear and faithful wife to his bosom. As the sight of land is welcome to men who are swimming towards the shore, when Poseidon has wrecked their ship with the fury of his winds and waves - a few alone reach the land, and these, covered with brine, are thankful when they find themselves on firm ground and out of danger - even so was her husband welcome to her as she looked upon him, and she could not tear her two fair arms from about his neck. Indeed they would have gone on indulging their sorrow till rosy-fingered morn appeared, had not Athena determined otherwise, and held night back in the far west, while she would not suffer Dawn to leave Okeanos, nor to yoke the two steeds Lampos and Phaethon that bear her onward to break the day upon humankind.	ὣς φάτο, τῷ δʼ ἔτι μᾶλλον ὑφʼ ἵμερον ὦρσε γόοιο· κλαῖε δʼ ἔχων ἄλοχον θυμαρέα, κεδνὰ ἰδυῖαν. ὡς δʼ ὅτʼ ἂν ἀσπάσιος γῆ νηχομένοισι φανήῃ, ὧν τε Ποσειδάων εὐεργέα νῆʼ ἐνὶ πόντῳ ῥαίσῃ, ἐπειγομένην ἀνέμῳ καὶ κύματι πηγῷ· παῦροι δʼ ἐξέφυγον πολιῆς ἁλὸς ἤπειρόνδε νηχόμενοι, πολλὴ δὲ περὶ χροῒ τέτροφεν ἅλμη, ἀσπάσιοι δʼ ἐπέβαν γαίης, κακότητα φυγόντες· ὣς ἄρα τῇ ἀσπαστὸς ἔην πόσις εἰσοροώσῃ, δειρῆς δʼ οὔ πω πάμπαν ἀφίετο πήχεε λευκώ. καί νύ κʼ ὀδυρομένοισι φάνη ῥοδοδάκτυλος Ἠώς, εἰ μὴ ἄρʼ ἄλλʼ ἐνόησε θεὰ γλαυκῶπις Ἀθήνη. νύκτα μὲν ἐν περάτῃ δολιχὴν σχέθεν, Ἠῶ δʼ αὖτε ῥύσατʼ ἐπʼ Ὠκεανῷ χρυσόθρονον, οὐδʼ ἔα ἵππους ζεύγνυσθʼ ὠκύποδας, φάος ἀνθρώποισι φέροντας,
"At last, however, Odysseus said, ""Wife, we have not yet reached the end of our trials  . I have an unknown amount of toil   still to undergo. It is long and difficult, but I must go through with it, for thus the shade   of Teiresias prophesied concerning me, on the day when I went down into Hades to ask about my return   and that of my companions. But now let us go to bed, that we may lie down and enjoy the blessed boon of sleep."""	Λάμπον καὶ Φαέθονθʼ, οἵ τʼ Ἠῶ πῶλοι ἄγουσι. καὶ τότʼ ἄρʼ ἣν ἄλοχον προσέφη πολύμητις Ὀδυσσεύς ὦ γύναι, οὐ γάρ πω πάντων ἐπὶ πείρατʼ ἀέθλων ἤλθομεν, ἀλλʼ ἔτʼ ὄπισθεν ἀμέτρητος πόνος ἔσται, πολλὸς καὶ χαλεπός, τὸν ἐμὲ χρὴ πάντα τελέσσαι. ὣς γάρ μοι ψυχὴ μαντεύσατο Τειρεσίαο ἤματι τῷ ὅτε δὴ κατέβην δόμον Ἄϊδος εἴσω, νόστον ἑταίροισιν διζήμενος ἠδʼ ἐμοὶ αὐτῷ. ἀλλʼ ἔρχευ, λέκτρονδʼ ἴομεν, γύναι, ὄφρα καὶ ἤδη ὕπνῳ ὕπο γλυκερῷ ταρπώμεθα κοιμηθέντε.
"""You shall go to bed as soon as you please,"" replied Penelope, ""now that the gods have sent you home to your own good house and to your country. But as heaven has put it in your mind to speak of it, tell me about the task   that lies before you. I shall have to hear about it later, so it is better that I should be told at once."""	τὸν δʼ αὖτε προσέειπε περίφρων Πηνελόπεια· εὐνὴ μὲν δή σοί γε τότʼ ἔσσεται ὁππότε θυμῷ σῷ ἐθέλῃς, ἐπεὶ ἄρ σε θεοὶ ποίησαν ἱκέσθαι οἶκον ἐϋκτίμενον καὶ σὴν ἐς πατρίδα γαῖαν· ἀλλʼ ἐπεὶ ἐφράσθης καί τοι θεὸς ἔμβαλε θυμῷ, εἴπʼ ἄγε μοι τὸν ἄεθλον, ἐπεὶ καὶ ὄπισθεν, ὀΐω, πεύσομαι, αὐτίκα δʼ ἐστὶ δαήμεναι οὔ τι χέρειον.
"""My dear,"" answered Odysseus, ""why should you press me to tell you? Still, I will not conceal it from you, though you will not like it. I do not like it myself, for Teiresias bade me travel far and wide, carrying an oar, till I came to a country where the people have never heard of the sea, and do not even mix salt with their food. They know nothing about ships, nor oars that are as the wings of a ship. He gave me this certain token   which I will not hide from you. He said that a wayfarer should meet me and ask me whether it was a winnowing shovel that I had on my shoulder. On this, I was to fix my oar in the ground and sacrifice a ram, a bull, and a boar to Poseidon; after which I was to go home and offer hecatombs to all the gods in heaven, one after the other. As for myself, he said that death should come to me from the sea, and that my life should ebb away very gently when I was full of years and peace of mind, and my people should be prosperous  . All this, he said, should surely come to pass."""	τὴν δʼ ἀπαμειβόμενος προσέφη πολύμητις Ὀδυσσεύς· δαιμονίη, τί τʼ ἄρʼ αὖ με μάλʼ ὀτρύνουσα κελεύεις εἰπέμεν; αὐτὰρ ἐγὼ μυθήσομαι οὐδʼ ἐπικεύσω. οὐ μέν τοι θυμὸς κεχαρήσεται· οὐδὲ γὰρ αὐτὸς χαίρω, ἐπεὶ μάλα πολλὰ βροτῶν ἐπὶ ἄστεʼ ἄνωγεν ἐλθεῖν, ἐν χείρεσσιν ἔχοντʼ εὐῆρες ἐρετμόν, εἰς ὅ κε τοὺς ἀφίκωμαι οἳ οὐκ ἴσασι θάλασσαν ἀνέρες, οὐδέ θʼ ἅλεσσι μεμιγμένον εἶδαρ ἔδουσιν· οὐδʼ ἄρα τοί γʼ ἴσασι νέας φοινικοπαρῄους, οὐδʼ εὐήρεʼ ἐρετμά, τά τε πτερὰ νηυσὶ πέλονται. σῆμα δέ μοι τόδʼ ἔειπεν ἀριφραδές, οὐδέ σε κεύσω· ὁππότε κεν δή μοι ξυμβλήμενος ἄλλος ὁδίτης φήῃ ἀθηρηλοιγὸν ἔχειν ἀνὰ φαιδίμῳ ὤμῳ, καὶ τότε μʼ ἐν γαίῃ πήξαντʼ ἐκέλευεν ἐρετμόν, ἔρξανθʼ ἱερὰ καλὰ Ποσειδάωνι ἄνακτι, ἀρνειὸν ταῦρόν τε συῶν τʼ ἐπιβήτορα κάπρον, οἴκαδʼ ἀποστείχειν, ἔρδειν θʼ ἱερὰς ἑκατόμβας ἀθανάτοισι θεοῖσι, τοὶ οὐρανὸν εὐρὺν ἔχουσι, πᾶσι μάλʼ ἑξείης· θάνατος δέ μοι ἐξ ἁλὸς αὐτῷ ἀβληχρὸς μάλα τοῖος ἐλεύσεται, ὅς κέ με πέφνῃ γήρα’ ὕπο λιπαρῷ ἀρημένον· ἀμφὶ δὲ λαοὶ ὄλβιοι ἔσσονται· τὰ δέ μοι φάτο πάντα τελεῖσθαι. τὸν δʼ αὖτε προσέειπε περίφρων Πηνελόπεια·
"And Penelope said, ""If the gods are going to grant you a happier time in your old age, you may hope then to have some respite from misfortune."""	εἰ μὲν δὴ γῆράς γε θεοὶ τελέουσιν ἄρειον, ἐλπωρή τοι ἔπειτα κακῶν ὑπάλυξιν ἔσεσθαι.
Thus did they converse. Meanwhile Eurynome and the nurse took torches and made the bed ready with soft coverlets; as soon as they had laid them, the nurse went back into the house to go to her rest, leaving the bed chamber woman Eurynome to show Odysseus and Penelope to bed by torch light. When she had conducted them to their room she went back, and they then came joyfully to the rites of their own old bed. Telemakhos, Philoitios, and the swineherd now left off dancing, and made the women leave off also. They then laid themselves down to sleep in the cloisters.	ὣς οἱ μὲν τοιαῦτα πρὸς ἀλλήλους ἀγόρευον· τόφρα δʼ ἄρʼ Εὐρυνόμη τε ἰδὲ τροφὸς ἔντυον εὐνὴν ἐσθῆτος μαλακῆς, δαΐδων ὕπο λαμπομενάων. αὐτὰρ ἐπεὶ στόρεσαν πυκινὸν λέχος ἐγκονέουσαι, γρηῢς μὲν κείουσα πάλιν οἶκόνδε βεβήκει, τοῖσιν δʼ Εὐρυνόμη θαλαμηπόλος ἡγεμόνευεν ἐρχομένοισι λέχοσδε, δάος μετὰ χερσὶν ἔχουσα· ἐς θάλαμον δʼ ἀγαγοῦσα πάλιν κίεν. οἱ μὲν ἔπειτα ἀσπάσιοι λέκτροιο παλαιοῦ θεσμὸν ἵκοντο· αὐτὰρ Τηλέμαχος καὶ βουκόλος ἠδὲ συβώτης παῦσαν ἄρʼ ὀρχηθμοῖο πόδας, παῦσαν δὲ γυναῖκας, αὐτοὶ δʼ εὐνάζοντο κατὰ μέγαρα σκιόεντα.
When Odysseus and Penelope had had their fill of love they fell talking with one another. She told him how much she had to bear in seeing the house filled with a crowd of wicked suitors who had killed so many sheep and oxen on her account, and had drunk so many casks of wine. Odysseus in his turn told her what he had suffered, and how much trouble he had himself given to other people. He told her everything, and she was so delighted to listen that she never went to sleep till he had ended his whole story.	τὼ δʼ ἐπεὶ οὖν φιλότητος ἐταρπήτην ἐρατεινῆς, τερπέσθην μύθοισι, πρὸς ἀλλήλους ἐνέποντε, ἡ μὲν ὅσʼ ἐν μεγάροισιν ἀνέσχετο δῖα γυναικῶν, ἀνδρῶν μνηστήρων ἐσορῶσʼ ἀΐδηλον ὅμιλον, οἳ ἕθεν εἵνεκα πολλά, βόας καὶ ἴφια μῆλα, ἔσφαζον, πολλὸς δὲ πίθων ἠφύσσετο οἶνος· αὐτὰρ ὁ διογενὴς Ὀδυσεὺς ὅσα κήδεʼ ἔθηκεν ἀνθρώποις ὅσα τʼ αὐτὸς ὀϊζύσας ἐμόγησε, πάντʼ ἔλεγʼ· ἡ δʼ ἄρʼ ἐτέρπετʼ ἀκούουσʼ, οὐδέ οἱ ὕπνος πῖπτεν ἐπὶ βλεφάροισι πάρος καταλέξαι ἅπαντα.
He began with his victory over the Kikones, and how he thence reached the fertile land of the Lotus-eaters. He told her all about the Cyclops and how he had punished him for having so ruthlessly eaten his brave comrades; how he then went on to Aeolus, who received him hospitably and furthered him on his way, but even so he was not to reach home, for to his great grief a gale carried him out to sea again; how he went on to the Laestrygonian city Telepylos, where the people destroyed all his ships with their crews, save himself and his own ship only. Then he told of cunning Circe and her craft, and how he sailed to the chill house of Hades, to consult the ghost   of the Theban seer Teiresias, and how he saw his old comrades in arms, and his mother who bore him and brought him up when he was a child; how he then heard the wondrous singing of the Sirens, and went on to the wandering rocks and terrible Charybdis and to Scylla, whom no man had ever yet passed in safety; how his men then ate the cattle of the sun-god, and how Zeus therefore struck the ship with his thunderbolts, so that all his men perished together, himself alone being left alive; how at last he reached the Ogygian island and the nymph Calypso, who kept him there in a cave, and fed him, and wanted him to marry her, in which case she intended making him immortal so that he should never grow old, but she could not persuade him to let her do so; and how after much suffering he had found his way to the Phaeacians, who had treated him as though he had been a god, and sent him back in a ship to his own country after having given him gold, bronze, and raiment in great abundance. This was the last thing about which he told her, for here a deep sleep took hold upon him and eased the burden of his sorrows.	ἤρξατο δʼ ὡς πρῶτον Κίκονας δάμασʼ, αὐτὰρ ἔπειτα ἦλθʼ ἐς Λωτοφάγων ἀνδρῶν πίειραν ἄρουραν· ἠδʼ ὅσα Κύκλωψ ἔρξε, καὶ ὡς ἀπετίσατο ποινὴν ἰφθίμων ἑτάρων, οὓς ἤσθιεν οὐδʼ ἐλέαιρεν· ἠδʼ ὡς Αἴολον ἵκεθʼ, ὅ μιν πρόφρων ὑπέδεκτο καὶ πέμπʼ, οὐδέ πω αἶσα φίλην ἐς πατρίδʼ ἱκέσθαι ἤην, ἀλλά μιν αὖτις ἀναρπάξασα θύελλα πόντον ἐπʼ ἰχθυόεντα φέρεν βαρέα στενάχοντα· ἠδʼ ὡς Τηλέπυλον Λαιστρυγονίην ἀφίκανεν, οἳ νῆάς τʼ ὄλεσαν καὶ ἐϋκνήμιδας ἑταίρους πάντας· Ὀδυσσεὺς δʼ οἶος ὑπέκφυγε νηῒ μελαίνῃ· καὶ Κίρκης κατέλεξε δόλον πολυμηχανίην τε, ἠδʼ ὡς εἰς Ἀΐδεω δόμον ἤλυθεν εὐρώεντα, ψυχῇ χρησόμενος Θηβαίου Τειρεσίαο, νηῒ πολυκλήϊδι, καὶ εἴσιδε πάντας ἑταίρους μητέρα θʼ, ἥ μιν ἔτικτε καὶ ἔτρεφε τυτθὸν ἐόντα· ἠδʼ ὡς Σειρήνων ἁδινάων φθόγγον ἄκουσεν, ὥς θʼ ἵκετο Πλαγκτὰς πέτρας δεινήν τε Χάρυβδιν Σκύλλην θʼ, ἣν οὔ πώ ποτʼ ἀκήριοι ἄνδρες ἄλυξαν· ἠδʼ ὡς Ἠελίοιο βόας κατέπεφνον ἑταῖροι· ἠδʼ ὡς νῆα θοὴν ἔβαλε ψολόεντι κεραυνῷ Ζεὺς ὑψιβρεμέτης, ἀπὸ δʼ ἔφθιθεν ἐσθλοὶ ἑταῖροι πάντες ὁμῶς, αὐτὸς δὲ κακὰς ὑπὸ κῆρας ἄλυξεν· ὥς θʼ ἵκετʼ Ὠγυγίην νῆσον νύμφην τε Καλυψώ, ἣ δή μιν κατέρυκε, λιλαιομένη πόσιν εἶναι, ἐν σπέσσι γλαφυροῖσι, καὶ ἔτρεφεν ἠδὲ ἔφασκε θήσειν ἀθάνατον καὶ ἀγήραον ἤματα πάντα· ἀλλὰ τοῦ οὔ ποτε θυμὸν ἐνὶ στήθεσσιν ἔπειθεν· ἠδʼ ὡς ἐς Φαίηκας ἀφίκετο πολλὰ μογήσας, οἳ δή μιν περὶ κῆρι θεὸν ὣς τιμήσαντο καὶ πέμψαν σὺν νηῒ φίλην ἐς πατρίδα γαῖαν, χαλκόν τε χρυσόν τε ἅλις ἐσθῆτά τε δόντες. τοῦτʼ ἄρα δεύτατον εἶπεν ἔπος, ὅτε οἱ γλυκὺς ὕπνος λυσιμελὴς ἐπόρουσε, λύων μελεδήματα θυμοῦ.
"Then Athena thought of another matter. When she deemed that Odysseus had had enough both of his wife and of repose, she bade gold-enthroned Dawn rise out of Okeanos that she might shed light upon humankind. On this, Odysseus rose from his comfortable bed and said to Penelope, ""Wife, we have both of us had our full share of trials  , you, here, in lamenting my absence, and I in being prevented from getting home   though I was longing all the time to do so. Now, however, that we have at last come together, take care of the property that is in the house. As for the sheep and goats which the wicked suitors have eaten, I will take many myself by force from other people, and will compel the Achaeans to make good the rest till they shall have filled all my yards. I am now going to the wooded lands out in the country to see my father who has so long been grieved on my account, and to yourself I will give these instructions, though you have little need of them. At sunrise it will at once get abroad that I have been killing the suitors; go upstairs, therefore, and stay there with your women. See nobody and ask no questions."""	ἡ δʼ αὖτʼ ἄλλʼ ἐνόησε θεὰ γλαυκῶπις Ἀθήνη· ὁππότε δή ῥʼ Ὀδυσῆα ἐέλπετο ὃν κατὰ θυμὸν εὐνῆς ἧς ἀλόχου ταρπήμεναι ἠδὲ καὶ ὕπνου, αὐτίκʼ ἀπʼ Ὠκεανοῦ χρυσόθρονον ἠριγένειαν ὦρσεν, ἵνʼ ἀνθρώποισι φόως φέροι· ὦρτο δʼ Ὀδυσσεὺς εὐνῆς ἐκ μαλακῆς, ἀλόχῳ δʼ ἐπὶ μῦθον ἔτελλεν· ὦ γύναι, ἤδη μὲν πολέων κεκορήμεθʼ ἀέθλων ἀμφοτέρω, σὺ μὲν ἐνθάδʼ ἐμὸν πολυκηδέα νόστον κλαίουσʼ. αὐτὰρ ἐμὲ Ζεὺς ἄλγεσι καὶ θεοὶ ἄλλοι ἱέμενον πεδάασκον ἐμῆς ἀπὸ πατρίδος αἴης· νῦν δʼ ἐπεὶ ἀμφοτέρω πολυήρατον ἱκόμεθʼ εὐνήν, κτήματα μὲν τά μοι ἔστι, κομιζέμεν ἐν μεγάροισι, μῆλα δʼ ἅ μοι μνηστῆρες ὑπερφίαλοι κατέκειραν, πολλὰ μὲν αὐτὸς ἐγὼ ληΐσσομαι, ἄλλα δʼ Ἀχαιοὶ δώσουσʼ, εἰς ὅ κε πάντας ἐνιπλήσωσιν ἐπαύλους. ἀλλʼ ἦ τοι μὲν ἐγὼ πολυδένδρεον ἀγρὸν ἔπειμι, ὀψόμενος πατέρʼ ἐσθλόν, ὅ μοι πυκινῶς ἀκάχηται· σοὶ δέ, γύναι, τάδʼ ἐπιτέλλω, πινυτῇ περ ἐούσῃ· αὐτίκα γὰρ φάτις εἶσιν ἅμʼ ἠελίῳ ἀνιόντι ἀνδρῶν μνηστήρων, οὓς ἔκτανον ἐν μεγάροισιν· εἰς ὑπερῷʼ ἀναβᾶσα σὺν ἀμφιπόλοισι γυναιξὶν ἧσθαι, μηδέ τινα προτιόσσεο μηδʼ ἐρέεινε.
As he spoke he girded on his armor. Then he roused Telemakhos, Philoitios, and Eumaios, and told them all to put on their armor also. This they did, and armed themselves. When they had done so, they opened the gates and sallied forth, Odysseus leading the way. It was now daylight, but Athena nevertheless concealed them in darkness and led them quickly out of the town.	ἦ ῥα καὶ ἀμφʼ ὤμοισιν ἐδύσετο τεύχεα καλά, ὦρσε δὲ Τηλέμαχον καὶ βουκόλον ἠδὲ συβώτην, πάντας δʼ ἔντεʼ ἄνωγεν ἀρήϊα χερσὶν ἑλέσθαι. οἱ δέ οἱ οὐκ ἀπίθησαν, ἐθωρήσσοντο δὲ χαλκῷ, ὤϊξαν δὲ θύρας, ἐκ δʼ ἤϊον· ἦρχε δʼ Ὀδυσσεύς. ἤδη μὲν φάος ἦεν ἐπὶ χθόνα, τοὺς δʼ ἄρʼ Ἀθήνη
Then Hermes of Cyllene summoned the ghosts   of the suitors, and in his hand he held the fair golden wand with which he seals men's eyes in sleep or wakes them just as he pleases; with this he roused the ghosts and led them, while they followed whining and gibbering behind him. As bats fly squealing in the hollow of some great cave, when one of them has fallen out of the cluster in which they hang, even so did the ghosts whine and squeal as Hermes the healer of sorrow led them down into the dark abode of death. When they had passed the waters of Okeanos and the rock Leukas , they came to the gates of the sun and the of dreams, whereon they reached the meadow of asphodel where dwell the souls and shadows of them that can labor no more.	Ἑρμῆς δὲ ψυχὰς Κυλλήνιος ἐξεκαλεῖτο ἀνδρῶν μνηστήρων· ἔχε δὲ ῥάβδον μετὰ χερσὶν καλὴν χρυσείην, τῇ τʼ ἀνδρῶν ὄμματα θέλγει ὧν ἐθέλει, τοὺς δʼ αὖτε καὶ ὑπνώοντας ἐγείρει· τῇ ῥʼ ἄγε κινήσας, ταὶ δὲ τρίζουσαι ἕποντο. ὡς δʼ ὅτε νυκτερίδες μυχῷ ἄντρου θεσπεσίοιο τρίζουσαι ποτέονται, ἐπεί κέ τις ἀποπέσῃσιν ὁρμαθοῦ ἐκ πέτρης, ἀνά τʼ ἀλλήλῃσιν ἔχονται, ὣς αἱ τετριγυῖαι ἅμʼ ἤϊσαν· ἦρχε δʼ ἄρα σφιν Ἑρμείας ἀκάκητα κατʼ εὐρώεντα κέλευθα. πὰρ δʼ ἴσαν Ὠκεανοῦ τε ῥοὰς καὶ Λευκάδα πέτρην, ἠδὲ παρʼ Ἠελίοιο πύλας καὶ δῆμον ὀνείρων ἤϊσαν· αἶψα δʼ ἵκοντο κατʼ ἀσφοδελὸν λειμῶνα, ἔνθα τε ναίουσι ψυχαί, εἴδωλα καμόντων.
Here they found the ghost   of Achilles son of Peleus, with those of Patroklos, Antilokhos, and Ajax, who was the finest and handsomest man of all the Danaans after the son of Peleus himself.	εὗρον δὲ ψυχὴν Πηληϊάδεω Ἀχιλῆος καὶ Πατροκλῆος καὶ ἀμύμονος Ἀντιλόχοιο Αἴαντός θʼ, ὃς ἄριστος ἔην εἶδός τε δέμας τε τῶν ἄλλων Δαναῶν μετʼ ἀμύμονα Πηλεΐδαο
They gathered round the ghost of the son of Peleus, and the ghost   of Agamemnon joined them, sorrowing bitterly. Round him were gathered also the ghosts of those who had perished with him in the house of Aigisthos; and the ghost   of Achilles spoke first.	ὣς οἱ μὲν περὶ κεῖνον ὁμίλεον· ἀγχίμολον δὲ ἤλυθʼ ἔπι ψυχὴ Ἀγαμέμνονος Ἀτρεΐδαο ἀχνυμένη· περὶ δʼ ἄλλαι ἀγηγέραθʼ, ὅσσαι ἅμʼ αὐτῷ οἴκῳ ἐν Αἰγίσθοιο θάνον καὶ πότμον ἐπέσπον. τὸν προτέρη ψυχὴ προσεφώνεε Πηλεΐωνος·
"""Son of Atreus,"" it said, ""we used to say that Zeus had loved you better from first to last than any other hero, for you were leader over many and brave men, when we were all fighting together in the of the Trojans; yet the hand of death, which no mortal can escape, was laid upon you all too early. Better for you had you fallen in the Trojan in the hey-day of your renown, for the Achaeans would have built a mound over your ashes, and your son would have been heir to your , whereas it has now been your lot to come to a most miserable end."""

"""Happy   son of Peleus,"" answered the ghost   of Agamemnon, ""for having died at Troy far from Argos , while the bravest of the Trojans and the Achaeans fell round you fighting for your body. There you lay in the whirling clouds of dust, all huge and hugely, heedless now of your chivalry. We fought the whole of the livelong day, nor should we ever have left off if Zeus had not sent a gale to stay us. Then, when we had borne you to the ships out of the fray, we laid you on your bed and cleansed your fair skin with warm water and with ointments. The Danaans tore their hair and wept bitterly round about you. Your mother, when she heard, came with her immortal nymphs from out of the sea, and the sound of a great wailing went forth over the waters so that the Achaeans quaked for fear. They would have fled panic-stricken to their ships had not wise old Nestor whose counsel was ever truest checked them saying, ‘Hold, Argives, flee not sons of the Achaeans, this is his mother coming from the sea with her immortal nymphs to view the body of her son.’"	τὸν δʼ αὖτε ψυχὴ προσεφώνεεν Ἀτρείδαο· ὄλβιε Πηλέος υἱέ, θεοῖς ἐπιείκελʼ Ἀχιλλεῦ, ὃς θάνες ἐν Τροίῃ ἑκὰς Ἄργεος· ἀμφὶ δέ σʼ ἄλλοι κτείνοντο Τρώων καὶ Ἀχαιῶν υἷες ἄριστοι, μαρνάμενοι περὶ σεῖο· σὺ δʼ ἐν στροφάλιγγι κονίης κεῖσο μέγας μεγαλωστί, λελασμένος ἱπποσυνάων. ἡμεῖς δὲ πρόπαν ἦμαρ ἐμαρνάμεθʼ· οὐδέ κε πάμπαν παυσάμεθα πτολέμου, εἰ μὴ Ζεὺς λαίλαπι παῦσεν. αὐτὰρ ἐπεί σʼ ἐπὶ νῆας ἐνείκαμεν ἐκ πολέμοιο, κάτθεμεν ἐν λεχέεσσι, καθήραντες χρόα καλὸν ὕδατί τε λιαρῷ καὶ ἀλείφατι· πολλὰ δέ σʼ ἀμφὶ δάκρυα θερμὰ χέον Δαναοὶ κείροντό τε χαίτας. μήτηρ δʼ ἐξ ἁλὸς ἦλθε σὺν ἀθανάτῃς ἁλίῃσιν ἀγγελίης ἀΐουσα· βοὴ δʼ ἐπὶ πόντον ὀρώρει θεσπεσίη, ὑπὸ δὲ τρόμος ἔλλαβε πάντας Ἀχαιούς· καί νύ κʼ ἀναΐξαντες ἔβαν κοίλας ἐπὶ νῆας, εἰ μὴ ἀνὴρ κατέρυκε παλαιά τε πολλά τε εἰδώς, Νέστωρ, οὗ καὶ πρόσθεν ἀρίστη φαίνετο βουλή· ὅ σφιν ἐϋφρονέων ἀγορήσατο καὶ μετέειπεν· ἴσχεσθʼ, Ἀργεῖοι, μὴ φεύγετε, κοῦροι Ἀχαιῶν· μήτηρ ἐξ ἁλὸς ἥδε σὺν ἀθανάτῃς ἁλίῃσιν ἔρχεται, οὗ παιδὸς τεθνηότος ἀντιόωσα.
"""Thus he spoke, and the Achaeans feared no more. The daughters of the old man of the sea stood round you weeping bitterly, and clothed you in immortal raiment. The nine muses also came and lifted up their sweet voices in lament - calling and answering one another; there was not an Argive but wept for pity of the dirge they chanted. Days and nights seven and ten we mourned you, mortals and immortals, but on the eighteenth day we gave you to the flames, and many a fat sheep with many an ox did we slay in sacrifice around you. You were burnt in raiment of the gods, with rich resins and with honey, while heroes, horse and foot, clashed their armor round the pile as you were burning, with the tramp as of a great multitude. But when the flames of heaven had done their work, we gathered your white bones at daybreak and laid them in ointments and in pure wine. Your mother brought us a golden vase to hold them - gift of Bacchus, and work of Hephaistos himself; in this we mingled your bleached bones with those of Patroklos who had gone before you, and separate we enclosed also those of Antilokhos, who had been closer to you than any other of your comrades now that Patroklos was no more."	ὣς ἔφαθʼ, οἱ δʼ ἔσχοντο φόβου μεγάθυμοι Ἀχαιοί· ἀμφὶ δέ σʼ ἔστησαν κοῦραι ἁλίοιο γέροντος οἴκτρʼ ὀλοφυρόμεναι, περὶ δʼ ἄμβροτα εἵματα ἕσσαν.

"""Over these the host of the Argives built a noble tomb, on a point jutting out over the open Hellespont , that it might be seen from far out upon the sea by those now living and by them that shall be born hereafter. Your mother begged prizes from the gods, and offered them to be contended for   by the noblest of the Achaeans. You must have been present at the funeral of many a hero, when the young men gird themselves and make ready to contend for prizes on the death of some great chieftain, but you never saw such prizes as silver-footed Thetis offered in your honor; for the gods loved you well. Thus even in death your , Achilles, has not been lost, and your name lives evermore among all humankind. But as for me, what solace had I when the days of my fighting were done? For Zeus willed my destruction on my return  , by the hands of Aigisthos and those of my wicked wife."""	ἀμφʼ αὐτοῖσι δʼ ἔπειτα μέγαν καὶ ἀμύμονα τύμβον χεύαμεν Ἀργείων ἱερὸς στρατὸς αἰχμητάων ἀκτῇ ἔπι προὐχούσῃ, ἐπὶ πλατεῖ Ἑλλησπόντῳ, ὥς κεν τηλεφανὴς ἐκ ποντόφιν ἀνδράσιν εἴη τοῖς οἳ νῦν γεγάασι καὶ οἳ μετόπισθεν ἔσονται. μήτηρ δʼ αἰτήσασα θεοὺς περικαλλέʼ ἄεθλα θῆκε μέσῳ ἐν ἀγῶνι ἀριστήεσσιν Ἀχαιῶν. ἤδη μὲν πολέων τάφῳ ἀνδρῶν ἀντεβόλησας ἡρώων, ὅτε κέν ποτʼ ἀποφθιμένου βασιλῆος ζώννυνταί τε νέοι καὶ ἐπεντύνονται ἄεθλα· ἀλλά κε κεῖνα μάλιστα ἰδὼν θηήσαο θυμῷ, οἷʼ ἐπὶ σοὶ κατέθηκε θεὰ περικαλλέʼ ἄεθλα, ἀργυρόπεζα Θέτις· μάλα γὰρ φίλος ἦσθα θεοῖσιν. ὣς σὺ μὲν οὐδὲ θανὼν ὄνομʼ ὤλεσας, ἀλλά τοι αἰεὶ πάντας ἐπʼ ἀνθρώπους κλέος ἔσσεται ἐσθλόν, Ἀχιλλεῦ, αὐτὰρ ἐμοὶ τί τόδʼ ἦδος, ἐπεὶ πόλεμον τολύπευσα; ἐν νόστῳ γάρ μοι Ζεὺς μήσατο λυγρὸν ὄλεθρον Αἰγίσθου ὑπὸ χερσὶ καὶ οὐλομένης ἀλόχοιο.
Thus did they converse, and presently Hermes came up to them with the ghosts of the suitors who had been killed by Odysseus. The ghosts   of Agamemnon and Achilles were astonished at seeing them, and went up to them at once. The ghost   of Agamemnon recognized Amphimedon son of Melaneus, who lived in Ithaca and had been his host, so it began to talk to him.	ὣς οἱ μὲν τοιαῦτα πρὸς ἀλλήλους ἀγόρευον, ἀγχίμολον δέ σφʼ ἦλθε διάκτορος ἀργεϊφόντης, ψυχὰς μνηστήρων κατάγων Ὀδυσῆϊ δαμέντων, τὼ δʼ ἄρα θαμβήσαντʼ ἰθὺς κίον, ὡς ἐσιδέσθην. ἔγνω δὲ ψυχὴ Ἀγαμέμνονος Ἀτρεΐδαο παῖδα φίλον Μελανῆος, ἀγακλυτὸν Ἀμφιμέδοντα· ξεῖνος γάρ οἱ ἔην Ἰθάκῃ ἔνι οἰκία ναίων. τὸν προτέρη ψυχὴ προσεφώνεεν Ἀτρεΐδαο·
"""Amphimedon,"" it said, ""what has happened to all you choice   young men - all of an age too - that you are come down here under the ground? One could select   no finer body of men from any city. Did Poseidon raise his winds and waves against you when you were at sea, or did your enemies make an end of you on the mainland when you were cattle-lifting or sheep-stealing, or while fighting in defense of their wives and city? Answer my question, for I have been your guest. Do you not remember how I came to your house with Menelaos, to persuade Odysseus to join us with his ships against Troy ? It was a whole month ere we could resume our voyage, for we had hard work to persuade Odysseus to come with us."""

"And the ghost   of Amphimedon answered, ""Agamemnon, son of Atreus, king of men, I remember everything that you have said, and will tell you fully and accurately about the way in which our end was brought about. Odysseus had been long gone, and we were courting his wife, who did not say point blank that she would not marry, nor yet bring matters to an end, for she meant to compass our destruction: this, then, was the trick she played us. She set up a great tambour frame in her room and began to work on an enormous piece of fine needlework. ‘Sweethearts,’ said she, ‘Odysseus is indeed dead, still, do not press me to marry again immediately; wait - for I would not have my skill in needlework perish unrecorded - till I have completed a shroud for the hero Laertes , against the time when death shall take him. He is very rich, and the women of the will talk if he is laid out without a shroud.’ This is what she said, and we assented; whereupon we could see her working upon her great web all day long, but at night she would unpick the stitches again by torchlight. She fooled us in this way for three years without our finding it out, but as time   wore on and she was now in her fourth year, and the waning of moons and many days had been accomplished, one of her maids who knew what she was doing told us, and we caught her in the act of undoing her work, so she had to finish it whether she would or not; and when she showed us the robe she had made, after she had had it washed, its splendor was as that of the sun or moon."	τὸν δʼ αὖτε ψυχὴ προσεφώνεεν Ἀμφιμέδοντος· Ἀτρεΐδη κύδιστε, ἄναξ ἀνδρῶν Ἀγάμεμνον, μέμνημαι τάδε πάντα, διοτρεφές, ὡς ἀγορεύεις· σοὶ δʼ ἐγὼ εὖ μάλα πάντα καὶ ἀτρεκέως καταλέξω, ἡμετέρου θανάτοιο κακὸν τέλος, οἷον ἐτύχθη. μνώμεθʼ Ὀδυσσῆος δὴν οἰχομένοιο δάμαρτα· ἡ δʼ οὔτʼ ἠρνεῖτο στυγερὸν γάμον οὔτʼ ἐτελεύτα, ἡμῖν φραζομένη θάνατον καὶ κῆρα μέλαιναν, ἀλλὰ δόλον τόνδʼ ἄλλον ἐνὶ φρεσὶ μερμήριξε· στησαμένη μέγαν ἱστὸν ἐνὶ μεγάροισιν ὕφαινε, λεπτὸν καὶ περίμετρον· ἄφαρ δʼ ἡμῖν μετέειπε· κοῦροι ἐμοὶ μνηστῆρες, ἐπεὶ θάνε δῖος Ὀδυσσεύς, μίμνετʼ ἐπειγόμενοι τὸν ἐμὸν γάμον, εἰς ὅ κε φᾶρος ἐκτελέσω, μή μοι μεταμώνια νήματʼ ὄληται, Λαέρτῃ ἥρωϊ ταφήϊον, εἰς ὅτε κέν μιν μοῖρʼ ὀλοὴ καθέλῃσι τανηλεγέος θανάτοιο, μή τίς μοι κατὰ δῆμον Ἀχαιϊάδων νεμεσήσῃ, αἴ κεν ἄτερ σπείρου κεῖται πολλὰ κτεατίσσας. ὣς ἔφαθʼ, ἡμῖν δʼ αὖτʼ ἐπεπείθετο θυμὸς ἀγήνωρ. ἔνθα καὶ ἠματίη μὲν ὑφαίνεσκεν μέγαν ἱστόν, νύκτας δʼ ἀλλύεσκεν, ἐπεὶ δαΐδας παραθεῖτο. ὣς τρίετες μὲν ἔληθε δόλῳ καὶ ἔπειθεν Ἀχαιούς· ἀλλʼ ὅτε τέτρατον ἦλθεν ἔτος καὶ ἐπήλυθον ὧραι, μηνῶν φθινόντων, περὶ δʼ ἤματα πόλλʼ ἐτελέσθη, καὶ τότε δή τις ἔειπε γυναικῶν, ἣ σάφα ᾔδη, καὶ τήν γʼ ἀλλύουσαν ἐφεύρομεν ἀγλαὸν ἱστόν. ὣς τὸ μὲν ἐξετέλεσσε καὶ οὐκ ἐθέλουσʼ, ὑπʼ ἀνάγκης. εὖθʼ ἡ φᾶρος ἔδειξεν, ὑφήνασα μέγαν ἱστόν, πλύνασʼ, ἠελίῳ ἐναλίγκιον ἠὲ σελήνῃ,
"""Then some malicious conveyed Odysseus to the upland farm where his swineherd lives. Thither presently came also his son, returning from a voyage to Pylos , and the two came to the town when they had hatched their plot for our destruction. Telemakhos came first, and then after him, accompanied by the swineherd, came Odysseus, clad in rags and leaning on a staff as though he were some miserable old beggar. He came so unexpectedly that none of us knew him, not even the older ones among us, and we reviled him and threw things at him. He endured both being struck and insulted without a word, though he was in his own house; but when the will   of Aegis-bearing Zeus inspired him, he and Telemakhos took the armor and hid it in an inner chamber, bolting the doors behind them. Then he cunningly made his wife offer his bow and a quantity of iron to be contended for by us ill-fated suitors; and this was the beginning of our end, for not one of us could string the bow - nor nearly do so. When it was about to reach the hands of Odysseus, we all of us shouted out that it should not be given him, no matter what he might say, but Telemakhos insisted on his having it. When he had got it in his hands he strung it with ease and sent his arrow through the iron. Then he stood on the floor of the room and poured his arrows on the ground, glaring fiercely about him. First he killed Antinoos, and then, aiming straight before him, he let fly his deadly darts and they fell thick on one another. It was plain that some one of the gods was helping them, for they fell upon us with might and main throughout the cloisters, and there was a hideous sound of groaning as our brains were being battered in, and the ground seethed with our blood. This, Agamemnon, is how we came by our end, and our bodies are lying still un-cared for in the house of Odysseus, for our friends at home do not yet know what has happened, so that they cannot lay us out and wash the black blood from our wounds, making moan over us according to the offices due to the departed."""	καὶ τότε δή ῥʼ Ὀδυσῆα κακός ποθεν ἤγαγε δαίμων ἀγροῦ ἐπʼ ἐσχατιήν, ὅθι δώματα ναῖε συβώτης. ἔνθʼ ἦλθεν φίλος υἱὸς Ὀδυσσῆος θείοιο, ἐκ Πύλου ἠμαθόεντος ἰὼν σὺν νηῒ μελαίνῃ· τὼ δὲ μνηστῆρσιν θάνατον κακὸν ἀρτύναντε ἵκοντο προτὶ ἄστυ περικλυτόν, ἦ τοι Ὀδυσσεὺς ὕστερος, αὐτὰρ Τηλέμαχος πρόσθʼ ἡγεμόνευε. τὸν δὲ συβώτης ἦγε κακὰ χροῒ εἵματʼ ἔχοντα, πτωχῷ λευγαλέῳ ἐναλίγκιον ἠδὲ γέροντι σκηπτόμενον· τὰ δὲ λυγρὰ περὶ χροῒ εἵματα ἕστο· οὐδέ τις ἡμείων δύνατο γνῶναι τὸν ἐόντα ἐξαπίνης προφανέντʼ, οὐδʼ οἳ προγενέστεροι ἦσαν, ἀλλʼ ἔπεσίν τε κακοῖσιν ἐνίσσομεν ἠδὲ βολῇσιν. αὐτὰρ ὁ τῆος ἐτόλμα ἐνὶ μεγάροισιν ἑοῖσι βαλλόμενος καὶ ἐνισσόμενος τετληότι θυμῷ· ἀλλʼ ὅτε δή μιν ἔγειρε Διὸς νοός αἰγιόχοιο, σὺν μὲν Τηλεμάχῳ περικαλλέα τεύχεʼ ἀείρας ἐς θάλαμον κατέθηκε καὶ ἐκλήϊσεν ὀχῆας, αὐτὰρ ὁ ἣν ἄλοχον πολυκερδείῃσιν ἄνωγε τόξον μνηστήρεσσι θέμεν πολιόν τε σίδηρον, ἡμῖν αἰνομόροισιν ἀέθλια καὶ φόνου ἀρχήν. οὐδέ τις ἡμείων δύνατο κρατεροῖο βιοῖο νευρὴν ἐντανύσαι, πολλὸν δʼ ἐπιδευέες ἦμεν. ἀλλʼ ὅτε χεῖρας ἵκανεν Ὀδυσσῆος μέγα τόξον, ἔνθʼ ἡμεῖς μὲν πάντες ὁμοκλέομεν ἐπέεσσι τόξον μὴ δόμεναι, μηδʼ εἰ μάλα πολλʼ ἀγορεύοι· Τηλέμαχος δέ μιν οἶος ἐποτρύνων ἐκέλευσεν. αὐτὰρ ὁ δέξατο χειρὶ πολύτλας δῖος Ὀδυσσεύς, ῥηϊδίως δʼ ἐτάνυσσε βιόν, διὰ δʼ ἧκε σιδήρου, στῆ δʼ ἄρʼ ἐπʼ οὐδὸν ἰών, ταχέας δʼ ἐκχεύατʼ ὀϊστοὺς δεινὸν παπταίνων, βάλε δʼ Ἀντίνοον βασιλῆα. αὐτὰρ ἔπειτʼ ἄλλοις ἐφίει βέλεα στονόεντα, ἄντα τιτυσκόμενος· τοὶ δʼ ἀγχιστῖνοι ἔπιπτον. γνωτὸν δʼ ἦν ὅ ῥά τίς σφι θεῶν ἐπιτάρροθος ἦεν· αὐτίκα γὰρ κατὰ δώματʼ ἐπισπόμενοι μένεϊ σφῷ κτεῖνον ἐπιστροφάδην, τῶν δὲ στόνος ὤρνυτʼ ἀεικὴς κράτων τυπτομένων, δάπεδον δʼ ἅπαν αἵματι θῦεν. ὣς ἡμεῖς, Ἀγάμεμνον, ἀπωλόμεθʼ, ὧν ἔτι καὶ νῦν σώματʼ ἀκηδέα κεῖται ἐνὶ μεγάροις Ὀδυσῆος· οὐ γάρ πω ἴσασι φίλοι κατὰ δώμαθʼ ἑκάστου, οἵ κʼ ἀπονίψαντες μέλανα βρότον ἐξ ὠτειλέων κατθέμενοι γοάοιεν· ὃ γὰρ γέρας ἐστὶ θανόντων.
"""Happy Odysseus, son of Laertes ,"" replied the ghost   of Agamemnon, ""you are indeed blessed   in the possession of a wife endowed with such rare excellence   of understanding, and so faithful to her wedded lord as Penelope the daughter of Ikarios. The , therefore, of her excellence   shall never die, and the immortals shall compose a song that shall be welcome to all humankind in honor of the constancy of Penelope. How far otherwise was the wickedness of the daughter of Tyndareus who killed her lawful husband; her song shall be hateful among men, for she has brought disgrace on all womankind even on the good ones."""	τὸν δʼ αὖτε ψυχὴ προσεφώνεεν Ἀτρεΐδαο· ὄλβιε Λαέρταο πάϊ, πολυμήχανʼ Ὀδυσσεῦ, ἦ ἄρα σὺν μεγάλῃ ἀρετῇ ἐκτήσω ἄκοιτιν. ὡς ἀγαθαὶ φρένες ἦσαν ἀμύμονι Πηνελοπείῃ, κούρῃ Ἰκαρίου· ὡς εὖ μέμνητʼ Ὀδυσῆος, ἀνδρὸς κουριδίου· τῷ οἱ κλέος οὔ ποτʼ ὀλεῖται ἧς ἀρετῆς, τεύξουσι δʼ ἐπιχθονίοισιν ἀοιδὴν ἀθάνατοι χαρίεσσαν ἐχέφρονι Πηνελοπείῃ, οὐχ ὡς Τυνδαρέου κούρη κακὰ μήσατο ἔργα, κουρίδιον κτείνασα πόσιν, στυγερὴ δέ τʼ ἀοιδὴ ἔσσετʼ ἐπʼ ἀνθρώπους, χαλεπὴν δέ τε φῆμιν ὀπάσσει θηλυτέρῃσι γυναιξί, καὶ ἥ κʼ εὐεργὸς ἔῃσιν.
Thus did they converse in the house of Hades deep down within the bowels of the earth. Meanwhile Odysseus and the others passed out of the town and soon reached the fair and well-tilled farm of Laertes , which he had reclaimed with infinite labor. Here was his house, with a lean-to running all round it, where the slaves who worked for him slept and sat and ate, while inside the house there was an old Sicel woman, who looked after him in this his country-farm. When Odysseus got there, he said to his son and to the other two:	ὣς οἱ μὲν τοιαῦτα πρὸς ἀλλήλους ἀγόρευον, ἑσταότʼ εἰν Ἀΐδαο δόμοις, ὑπὸ κεύθεσι γαίης· οἱ δʼ ἐπεὶ ἐκ πόλιος κατέβαν, τάχα δʼ ἀγρὸν ἵκοντο καλὸν Λαέρταο τετυγμένον, ὅν ῥά ποτʼ αὐτὸς Λαέρτης κτεάτισσεν, ἐπεὶ μάλα πόλλʼ ἐμόγησεν. ἔνθα οἱ οἶκος ἔην, περὶ δὲ κλίσιον θέε πάντη, ἐν τῷ σιτέσκοντο καὶ ἵζανον ἠδὲ ἴαυον δμῶες ἀναγκαῖοι, τοί οἱ φίλα ἐργάζοντο. ἐν δὲ γυνὴ Σικελὴ γρηῢς πέλεν, ἥ ῥα γέροντα ἐνδυκέως κομέεσκεν ἐπʼ ἀγροῦ, νόσφι πόληος. ἔνθʼ Ὀδυσεὺς δμώεσσι καὶ υἱέϊ μῦθον ἔειπεν·
"""Go to the house, and kill the best pig that you can find for dinner. Meanwhile I want to see whether my father will know me, or fail to recognize me after so long an absence."""	ὑμεῖς μὲν νῦν ἔλθετʼ ἐϋκτίμενον δόμον εἴσω, δεῖπνον δʼ αἶψα συῶν ἱερεύσατε ὅς τις ἄριστος· αὐτὰρ ἐγὼ πατρὸς πειρήσομαι ἡμετέροιο, αἴ κέ μʼ ἐπιγνώῃ καὶ φράσσεται ὀφθαλμοῖσιν, ἦέ κεν ἀγνοιῇσι, πολὺν χρόνον ἀμφὶς ἐόντα.
He then took off his armor and gave it to Eumaios and Philoitios, who went straight on to the house, while he turned off into the vineyard to make trial of his father. As he went down into the great orchard, he did not see Dolios, nor any of his sons nor of the other bondsmen, for they were all gathering thorns to make a fence for the vineyard, at the place where the old man had told them; he therefore found his father alone, hoeing a vine. He had on a dirty old shirt, patched and very shabby; his legs were bound round with thongs of oxhide to save him from the brambles, and he also wore sleeves of leather; he had a goat skin cap on his head, and was looking very woe-begone  . When Odysseus saw him so worn, so old and full of sorrow  , he stood still under a tall pear tree and began to weep. He doubted whether to embrace him, kiss him, and tell him all about his having come home, or whether he should first question him and see what he would say. In the end he deemed it best to be crafty with him, so in this mind he went up to his father, who was bending down and digging about a plant.	ὣς εἰπὼν δμώεσσιν ἀρήϊα τεύχεʼ ἔδωκεν. οἱ μὲν ἔπειτα δόμονδε θοῶς κίον, αὐτὰρ Ὀδυσσεὺς ἆσσον ἴεν πολυκάρπου ἀλωῆς πειρητίζων. οὐδʼ εὗρεν Δολίον, μέγαν ὄρχατον ἐσκαταβαίνων, οὐδέ τινα δμώων οὐδʼ υἱῶν· ἀλλʼ ἄρα τοί γε αἱμασιὰς λέξοντες ἀλωῆς ἔμμεναι ἕρκος ᾤχοντʼ, αὐτὰρ ὁ τοῖσι γέρων ὁδὸν ἡγεμόνευε. τὸν δʼ οἶον πατέρʼ εὗρεν ἐϋκτιμένῃ ἐν ἀλωῇ, λιστρεύοντα φυτόν· ῥυπόωντα δὲ ἕστο χιτῶνα ῥαπτὸν ἀεικέλιον, περὶ δὲ κνήμῃσι βοείας κνημῖδας ῥαπτὰς δέδετο, γραπτῦς ἀλεείνων, χειρῖδάς τʼ ἐπὶ χερσὶ βάτων ἕνεκʼ· αὐτὰρ ὕπερθεν αἰγείην κυνέην κεφαλῇ ἔχε, πένθος ἀέξων. τὸν δʼ ὡς οὖν ἐνόησε πολύτλας δῖος Ὀδυσσεὺς γήραϊ τειρόμενον, μέγα δὲ φρεσὶ πένθος ἔχοντα, στὰς ἄρʼ ὑπὸ βλωθρὴν ὄγχνην κατὰ δάκρυον εἶβε. μερμήριξε δʼ ἔπειτα κατὰ φρένα καὶ κατὰ θυμὸν κύσσαι καὶ περιφῦναι ἑὸν πατέρʼ, ἠδὲ ἕκαστα εἰπεῖν, ὡς ἔλθοι καὶ ἵκοιτʼ ἐς πατρίδα γαῖαν, ἦ πρῶτʼ ἐξερέοιτο ἕκαστά τε πειρήσαιτο. ὧδε δέ οἱ φρονέοντι δοάσσατο κέρδιον εἶναι, πρῶτον κερτομίοις ἐπέεσσιν πειρηθῆναι. τὰ φρονέων ἰθὺς κίεν αὐτοῦ δῖος Ὀδυσσεύς. ἦ τοι ὁ μὲν κατέχων κεφαλὴν φυτὸν ἀμφελάχαινε· τὸν δὲ παριστάμενος προσεφώνεε φαίδιμος υἱός·
"""I see, sir,"" said Odysseus, ""that you are an excellent gardener - what pains you take with it, to be sure. There is not a single plant, not a fig tree, vine, olive, pear, nor flower bed, but bears the trace of your attention. I trust, however, that you will not be offended if I say that you take better care of your garden than of yourself. You are old, unsavory, and very meanly clad. It cannot be because you are idle that your master takes such poor care of you, indeed your face and figure have nothing of the slave about them, and proclaim you of noble birth. I should have said that you were one of those who should wash well, eat well, and lie soft at night as old men have a right   to do; but tell me, and tell me true, whose laborer are you, and in whose garden are you working? Tell me also about another matter. Is this place that I have come to really Ithaca ? I met a man just now who said so, but he was a dull fellow, and had not the patience to hear my story out when I was asking him about an old friend of mine, whether he was still living, or was already dead and in the house of Hades. Believe me when I tell you that this man came to my house once when I was in my own country and never yet did any stranger come to me whom I liked better. He said that his family came from Ithaca and that his father was Laertes , son of Arceisius. I received him hospitably, making him welcome to all the abundance of my house, and when he went away I gave him all customary presents. I gave him seven talents of fine gold, and a cup of solid silver with flowers chased upon it. I gave him twelve light cloaks, and as many pieces of tapestry; I also gave him twelve cloaks of single fold, twelve rugs, twelve fair mantles, and an equal number of shirts. To all this I added four good looking women skilled in all useful arts, and I let him take his choice."""	ὦ γέρον, οὐκ ἀδαημονίη σʼ ἔχει ἀμφιπολεύειν ὄρχατον, ἀλλʼ εὖ τοι κομιδὴ ἔχει, οὐδέ τι πάμπαν, οὐ φυτόν, οὐ συκέη, οὐκ ἄμπελος, οὐ μὲν ἐλαίη, οὐκ ὄγχνη, οὐ πρασιή τοι ἄνευ κομιδῆς κατὰ κῆπον. ἄλλο δέ τοι ἐρέω, σὺ δὲ μὴ χόλον ἔνθεο θυμῷ αὐτόν σʼ οὐκ ἀγαθὴ κομιδὴ ἔχει, ἀλλʼ ἅμα γῆρας λυγρὸν ἔχεις αὐχμεῖς τε κακῶς καὶ ἀεικέα ἕσσαι. οὐ μὲν ἀεργίης γε ἄναξ ἕνεκʼ οὔ σε κομίζει, οὐδέ τί τοι δούλειον ἐπιπρέπει εἰσοράασθαι εἶδος καὶ μέγεθος· βασιλῆϊ γὰρ ἀνδρὶ ἔοικας. τοιούτῳ δὲ ἔοικας, ἐπεὶ λούσαιτο φάγοι τε, εὑδέμεναι μαλακῶς· ἡ γὰρ δίκη ἐστὶ γερόντων. ἀλλʼ ἄγε μοι τόδε εἰπὲ καὶ ἀτρεκέως κατάλεξον, τεῦ δμὼς εἶς ἀνδρῶν; τεῦ δʼ ὄρχατον ἀμφιπολεύεις; καὶ μοι τοῦτʼ ἀγόρευσον ἐτήτυμον, ὄφρʼ ἐῢ εἰδῶ, εἰ ἐτεόν γʼ Ἰθάκην τήνδʼ ἱκόμεθʼ, ὥς μοι ἔειπεν οὗτος ἀνὴρ νῦν δὴ ξυμβλήμενος ἐνθάδʼ ἰόντι, οὔ τι μάλʼ ἀρτίφρων, ἐπεὶ οὐ τόλμησεν ἕκαστα εἰπεῖν ἠδʼ ἐπακοῦσαι ἐμὸν ἔπος, ὡς ἐρέεινον ἀμφὶ ξείνῳ ἐμῷ, ἤ που ζώει τε καὶ ἔστιν ἦ ἤδη τέθνηκε καὶ εἰν Ἀΐδαο δόμοισιν. ἐκ γάρ τοι ἐρέω, σὺ δὲ σύνθεο καί μευ ἄκουσον· ἄνδρα ποτʼ ἐξείνισσα φίλῃ ἐνὶ πατρίδι γαίῃ ἡμέτερόνδʼ ἐλθόντα, καὶ οὔ πω τις βροτὸς ἄλλος ξείνων τηλεδαπῶν φιλίων ἐμὸν ἵκετο δῶμα· εὔχετο δʼ ἐξ Ἰθάκης γένος ἔμμεναι, αὐτὰρ ἔφασκε Λαέρτην Ἀρκεισιάδην πατέρʼ ἔμμεναι αὐτῷ. τὸν μὲν ἐγὼ πρὸς δώματʼ ἄγων ἐῢ ἐξείνισσα, ἐνδυκέως φιλέων, πολλῶν κατὰ οἶκον ἐόντων, καί οἱ δῶρα πόρον ξεινήϊα, οἷα ἐῴκει. χρυσοῦ μέν οἱ δῶκʼ εὐεργέος ἑπτὰ τάλαντα, δῶκα δέ οἱ κρητῆρα πανάργυρον ἀνθεμόεντα, δώδεκα δʼ ἁπλοΐδας χλαίνας, τόσσους δὲ τάπητας, τόσσα δὲ φάρεα καλά, τόσους δʼ ἐπὶ τοῖσι χιτῶνας, χωρὶς δʼ αὖτε γυναῖκας, ἀμύμονα ἔργα ἰδυίας, τέσσαρας εἰδαλίμας, ἃς ἤθελεν αὐτὸς ἑλέσθαι.

But tell me, and tell me true, how many years is it since you entertained this guest - my unhappy son, as ever was? Alas! He has perished far from his own country; the fishes of the sea have eaten him, or he has fallen a prey to the birds and wild beasts of some continent. Neither his mother, nor I his father, who were his parents, could throw our arms about him and wrap him in his shroud, nor could his excellent and richly dowered wife Penelope bewail her husband as was natural upon his death bed, and close his eyes according to the offices due to the departed. But now, tell me truly for I want to know. Who and whence are you - tell me of your town and parents? Where is the ship lying that has brought you and your men to Ithaca ? Or were you a passenger on some other man's ship, and those who brought you here have gone on their way and left you?"""	τὸν δʼ ἠμείβετʼ ἔπειτα πατὴρ κατὰ δάκρυον εἴβων· ξεῖνʼ, ἦ τοι μὲν γαῖαν ἱκάνεις, ἣν ἐρεείνεις, ὑβρισταὶ δʼ αὐτὴν καὶ ἀτάσθαλοι ἄνδρες ἔχουσιν· δῶρα δʼ ἐτώσια ταῦτα χαρίζεο, μυρίʼ ὀπάζων· εἰ γάρ μιν ζωόν γʼ ἐκίχεις Ἰθάκης ἐνὶ δήμῳ, τῷ κέν σʼ εὖ δώροισιν ἀμειψάμενος ἀπέπεμψε καὶ ξενίῃ ἀγαθῇ ἡ γὰρ θέμις, ὅς τις ὑπάρξῃ. ἀλλʼ ἄγε μοι τόδε εἰπὲ καὶ ἀτρεκέως κατάλεξον, πόστον δὴ ἔτος ἐστίν, ὅτε ξείνισσας ἐκεῖνον σὸν ξεῖνον δύστηνον, ἐμὸν παῖδʼ, εἴ ποτʼ ἔην γε, δύσμορον; ὅν που τῆλε φίλων καὶ πατρίδος αἴης ἠέ που ἐν πόντῳ φάγον ἰχθύες, ἢ ἐπὶ χέρσου θηρσὶ καὶ οἰωνοῖσιν ἕλωρ γένετʼ· οὐδέ ἑ μήτηρ κλαῦσε περιστείλασα πατήρ θʼ, οἵ μιν τεκόμεσθα· οὐδʼ ἄλοχος πολύδωρος, ἐχέφρων Πηνελόπεια, κώκυσʼ ἐν λεχέεσσιν ἑὸν πόσιν, ὡς ἐπεῴκει, ὀφθαλμοὺς καθελοῦσα· τὸ γὰρ γέρας ἐστὶ θανόντων. καί μοι τοῦτʼ ἀγόρευσον ἐτήτυμον, ὄφρʼ ἐῢ εἰδῶ· τίς πόθεν εἶς ἀνδρῶν; πόθι τοι πόλις ἠδὲ τοκῆες; ποῦ δὲ νηῦς ἕστηκε θοή, ἥ σʼ ἤγαγε δεῦρο ἀντιθέους θʼ ἑτάρους; ἦ ἔμπορος εἰλήλουθας νηὸς ἐπʼ ἀλλοτρίης, οἱ δʼ ἐκβήσαντες ἔβησαν;

As for my ship it is lying over yonder, off the open country outside the town, and this is the fifth year since Odysseus left my country. Poor fellow, yet the omens were good for him when he left me. The birds all flew on our right hands, and both he and I rejoiced to see them as we parted, for we had every hope that we should have another friendly meeting and exchange presents."""	τὸν δʼ ἀπαμειβόμενος προσέφη πολύμητις Ὀδυσσεύς· τοιγὰρ ἐγώ τοι πάντα μάλʼ ἀτρεκέως καταλέξω. εἰμὶ μὲν ἐξ Ἀλύβαντος, ὅθι κλυτὰ δώματα ναίω, υἱὸς Ἀφείδαντος Πολυπημονίδαο ἄνακτος· αὐτὰρ ἐμοί γʼ ὄνομʼ ἐστὶν Ἐπήριτος· ἀλλά με δαίμων πλάγξʼ ἀπὸ Σικανίης δεῦρʼ ἐλθέμεν οὐκ ἐθέλοντα· νηῦς δέ μοι ἥδʼ ἕστηκεν ἐπʼ ἀγροῦ νόσφι πόληος. αὐτὰρ Ὀδυσσῆϊ τόδε δὴ πέμπτον ἔτος ἐστίν, ἐξ οὗ κεῖθεν ἔβη καὶ ἐμῆς ἀπελήλυθε πάτρης, δύσμορος· ἦ τέ οἱ ἐσθλοὶ ἔσαν ὄρνιθες ἰόντι, δεξιοί, οἷς χαίρων μὲν ἐγὼν ἀπέπεμπον ἐκεῖνον, χαῖρε δὲ κεῖνος ἰών· θυμὸς δʼ ἔτι νῶϊν ἐώλπει μίξεσθαι ξενίῃ ἠδʼ ἀγλαὰ δῶρα διδώσειν.
"A dark cloud of sorrow   fell upon Laertes as he listened. He filled both hands with the dust from off the ground and poured it over his gray head, groaning heavily as he did so. The heart of Odysseus was touched, and his nostrils quivered as he looked upon his father; then he sprang towards him, flung his arms about him and kissed him, saying, ""I am he, father, about whom you are asking - I have returned after having been away for twenty years. But cease your sighing and lamentation - we have no time to lose, for I should tell you that I have been killing the suitors in my house, to punish them for their insolence and crimes."""	ὣς φάτο, τὸν δʼ ἄχεος νεφέλη ἐκάλυψε μέλαινα· ἀμφοτέρῃσι δὲ χερσὶν ἑλὼν κόνιν αἰθαλόεσσαν χεύατο κὰκ κεφαλῆς πολιῆς, ἁδινὰ στεναχίζων. τοῦ δʼ ὠρίνετο θυμός, ἀνὰ ῥῖνας δέ οἱ ἤδη δριμὺ μένος προὔτυψε φίλον πατέρʼ εἰσορόωντι. κύσσε δέ μιν περιφὺς ἐπιάλμενος, ἠδὲ προσηύδα· κεῖνος μέν τοι ὅδʼ αὐτὸς ἐγώ, πάτερ, ὃν σὺ μεταλλᾷς, ἤλυθον εἰκοστῷ ἔτεϊ ἐς πατρίδα γαῖαν. ἀλλʼ ἴσχεο κλαυθμοῖο γόοιό τε δακρυόεντος. ἐκ γάρ τοι ἐρέω· μάλα δὲ χρὴ σπευδέμεν ἔμπης· μνηστῆρας κατέπεφνον ἐν ἡμετέροισι δόμοισι, λώβην τινύμενος θυμαλγέα καὶ κακὰ ἔργα.
"""If you really are my son Odysseus,"" replied Laertes , ""and have come back again, you must give me such manifest proof   of your identity as shall convince me."""	τὸν δʼ αὖ Λαέρτης ἀπαμείβετο φώνησέν τε· εἰ μὲν δὴ Ὀδυσεύς γε ἐμὸς πάϊς ἐνθάδʼ ἱκάνεις, σῆμά τί μοι νῦν εἰπὲ ἀριφραδές, ὄφρα πεποίθω.
"""First observe this scar,"" answered Odysseus, ""which I got from a boar's tusk when I was hunting on Mount Parnassus. You and my mother had sent me to Autolykos, my mother's father, to receive the presents which when he was over here he had promised to give me. Furthermore I will point out to you the trees in the vineyard which you gave me, and I asked you all about them as I followed you round the garden. We went over them all, and you told me their names and what they all were. You gave me thirteen pear trees, ten apple trees, and forty fig trees; you also said you would give me fifty rows of vines; there was wheat planted between each row, and they yield grapes of every kind when the seasons   of Zeus have been laid heavy upon them."""	τὸν δʼ ἀπαμειβόμενος προσέφη πολύμητις Ὀδυσσεύς· οὐλὴν μὲν πρῶτον τήνδε φράσαι ὀφθαλμοῖσι, τὴν ἐν Παρνησῷ μʼ ἔλασεν σῦς λευκῷ ὀδόντι οἰχόμενον· σὺ δέ με προΐεις καὶ πότνια μήτηρ ἐς πατέρʼ Αὐτόλυκον μητρὸς φίλον, ὄφρʼ ἂν ἑλοίμην δῶρα, τὰ δεῦρο μολών μοι ὑπέσχετο καὶ κατένευσεν. εἰ δʼ ἄγε τοι καὶ δένδρεʼ ἐϋκτιμένην κατʼ ἀλωὴν εἴπω, ἅ μοί ποτʼ ἔδωκας, ἐγὼ δʼ ᾔτεόν σε ἕκαστα παιδνὸς ἐών, κατὰ κῆπον ἐπισπόμενος· διὰ δʼ αὐτῶν ἱκνεύμεσθα, σὺ δʼ ὠνόμασας καὶ ἔειπες ἕκαστα. ὄγχνας μοι δῶκας τρισκαίδεκα καὶ δέκα μηλέας, συκέας τεσσαράκοντʼ· ὄρχους δέ μοι ὧδʼ ὀνόμηνας δώσειν πεντήκοντα, διατρύγιος δὲ ἕκαστος ἤην· ἔνθα δʼ ἀνὰ σταφυλαὶ παντοῖαι ἔασιν— ὁππότε δὴ Διὸς ὧραι ἐπιβρίσειαν ὕπερθεν.
"Laertes ’ strength failed him when he heard the convincing proofs   which his son had given him. He threw his arms about him, and Odysseus had to support him, or he would have gone off into a swoon; but as soon as he came to, and was beginning to recover his senses, he said, ""O father Zeus, then you gods are still in Olympus after all, if the suitors have really been punished for their insolence   and folly. Nevertheless, I am much afraid that I shall have all the townspeople of Ithaca up here directly, and they will be sending messengers everywhere throughout the cities of the Cephallênians."""	ὣς φάτο, τοῦ δʼ αὐτοῦ λύτο γούνατα καὶ φίλον ἦτορ, σήματʼ ἀναγνόντος τά οἱ ἔμπεδα πέφραδʼ Ὀδυσσεύς. ἀμφὶ δὲ παιδὶ φίλῳ βάλε πήχεε· τὸν δὲ ποτὶ οἷ εἷλεν ἀποψύχοντα πολύτλας δῖος Ὀδυσσεύς. αὐτὰρ ἐπεί ῥʼ ἄμπνυτο καὶ ἐς φρένα θυμὸς ἀγέρθη, ἐξαῦτις μύθοισιν ἀμειβόμενος προσέειπε· Ζεῦ πάτερ, ἦ ῥα ἔτʼ ἔστε θεοὶ κατὰ μακρὸν Ὄλυμπον, εἰ ἐτεὸν μνηστῆρες ἀτάσθαλον ὕβριν ἔτισαν. νῦν δʼ αἰνῶς δείδοικα κατὰ φρένα μὴ τάχα πάντες ἐνθάδʼ ἐπέλθωσιν Ἰθακήσιοι, ἀγγελίας δὲ πάντη ἐποτρύνωσι Κεφαλλήνων πολίεσσι.
"Odysseus answered, ""Take heart and do not trouble yourself about that, but let us go into the house hard by your garden. I have already told Telemakhos, Philoitios, and Eumaios to go on there and get dinner ready as soon as possible."""	τὸν δʼ ἀπαμειβόμενος προσέφη πολύμητις Ὀδυσσεύς· θάρσει, μή τοι ταῦτα μετὰ φρεσὶ σῇσι μελόντων. ἀλλʼ ἴομεν προτὶ οἶκον, ὃς ὀρχάτου ἐγγύθι κεῖται· ἔνθα δὲ Τηλέμαχον καὶ βουκόλον ἠδὲ συβώτην προὔπεμψʼ, ὡς ἂν δεῖπνον ἐφοπλίσσωσι τάχιστα.
"Thus conversing the two made their way towards the house. When they got there they found Telemakhos with the stockman and the swineherd cutting up meat and mixing wine with water. Then the old Sicel woman took Laertes inside and washed him and anointed him with oil. She put him on a good cloak, and Athena came up to him and gave him a more imposing presence, making him taller and stouter than before. When he came back his son was surprised to see him looking so like an immortal, and said to him, ""My dear father, some one of the gods has been making you much taller and better-looking."""	ὣς ἄρα φωνήσαντε βάτην πρὸς δώματα καλά. οἱ δʼ ὅτε δή ῥʼ ἵκοντο δόμους εὖ ναιετάοντας, εὗρον Τηλέμαχον καὶ βουκόλον ἠδὲ συβώτην ταμνομένους κρέα πολλὰ κερῶντάς τʼ αἴθοπα οἶνον. τόφρα δὲ Λαέρτην μεγαλήτορα ᾧ ἐνὶ οἴκῳ ἀμφίπολος Σικελὴ λοῦσεν καὶ χρῖσεν ἐλαίῳ, ἀμφὶ δʼ ἄρα χλαῖναν καλὴν βάλεν· αὐτὰρ Ἀθήνη ἄγχι παρισταμένη μέλεʼ ἤλδανε ποιμένι λαῶν, μείζονα δʼ ἠὲ πάρος καὶ πάσσονα θῆκεν ἰδέσθαι. ἐκ δʼ ἀσαμίνθου βῆ· θαύμαζε δέ μιν φίλος υἱός, ὡς ἴδεν ἀθανάτοισι θεοῖς ἐναλίγκιον ἄντην· καί μιν φωνήσας ἔπεα πτερόεντα προσηύδα· ὦ πάτερ, ἦ μάλα τίς σε θεῶν αἰειγενετάων εἶδός τε μέγεθός τε ἀμείνονα θῆκεν ἰδέσθαι.
"Laertes answered, ""Would, by Father Zeus, Athena, and Apollo, that I were the man I was when I ruled among the Cephallênians, and took Nericum, that strong fortress on the foreland. If I were still what I then was and had been in our house yesterday with my armor on, I should have been able to stand by you and help you against the suitors. I should have killed a great many of them, and you would have rejoiced to see it."""	τὸν δʼ αὖ Λαέρτης πεπνυμένος ἀντίον ηὔδα· αἲ γάρ, Ζεῦ τε πάτερ καὶ Ἀθηναίη καὶ Ἄπολλον, οἷος Νήρικον εἷλον, ἐϋκτίμενον πτολίεθρον, ἀκτὴν ἠπείροιο, Κεφαλλήνεσσιν ἀνάσσων, τοῖος ἐών τοι χθιζὸς ἐν ἡμετέροισι δόμοισιν, τεύχεʼ ἔχων ὤμοισιν, ἐφεστάμεναι καὶ ἀμύνειν ἄνδρας μνηστῆρας· τῷ κε σφέων γούνατʼ ἔλυσα πολλῶν ἐν μεγάροισι, σὺ δὲ φρένας ἔνδον ἐγήθεις.
"Thus did they converse; but the others, when they had finished their work and the feast was ready, left off working  , and took each his proper place on the benches and seats. Then they began eating; by and by old Dolios and his sons left their work and came up, for their mother, the Sicel woman who looked after Laertes now that he was growing old, had been to fetch them. When they saw Odysseus and were certain it was he, they stood there lost in astonishment; but Odysseus scolded them good-naturedly and said, ""Sit down to your dinner, old man, and never mind about your surprise; we have been wanting to begin for some time and have been waiting for you."""	ὣς οἷ μὲν τοιαῦτα πρὸς ἀλλήλους ἀγόρευον. οἱ δʼ ἐπεὶ οὖν παύσαντο πόνου τετύκοντό τε δαῖτα, ἑξείης ἕζοντο κατὰ κλισμούς τε θρόνους τε· ἔνθʼ οἱ μὲν δείπνῳ ἐπεχείρεον, ἀγχίμολον δὲ ἦλθʼ ὁ γέρων Δολίος, σὺν δʼ υἱεῖς τοῖο γέροντος, ἐξ ἔργων μογέοντες, ἐπεὶ προμολοῦσα κάλεσσεν μήτηρ γρηῦς Σικελή, ἥ σφεας τρέφε καί ῥα γέροντα ἐνδυκέως κομέεσκεν, ἐπεὶ κατὰ γῆρας ἔμαρψεν. οἱ δʼ ὡς οὖν Ὀδυσῆα ἴδον φράσσαντό τε θυμῷ, ἔσταν ἐνὶ μεγάροισι τεθηπότες· αὐτὰρ Ὀδυσσεὺς μειλιχίοις ἐπέεσσι καθαπτόμενος προσέειπεν· ὦ γέρον, ἵζʼ ἐπὶ δεῖπνον, ἀπεκλελάθεσθε δὲ θάμβευς· δηρὸν γὰρ σίτῳ ἐπιχειρήσειν μεμαῶτες μίμνομεν ἐν μεγάροις, ὑμέας ποτιδέγμενοι αἰεί.
"Then Dolios put out both his hands and went up to Odysseus. ""Sir,"" said he, seizing his master's hand and kissing it at the wrist, ""we have long been wishing you home: and now heaven has restored you to us after we had given up hoping. All hail, therefore, and may the gods prosper you  . But tell me, does Penelope already know of your return, or shall we send some one to tell her?"""	ὣς ἄρ ἔφη, Δολίος δʼ ἰθὺς κίε χεῖρε πετάσσας ἀμφοτέρας, Ὀδυσεῦς δὲ λαβὼν κύσε χεῖρʼ ἐπὶ καρπῷ, καί μιν φωνήσας ἔπεα πτερόεντα προσηύδα· ὦ φίλʼ, ἐπεὶ νόστησας ἐελδομένοισι μάλʼ ἡμῖν οὐδʼ ἔτʼ ὀϊομένοισι, θεοὶ δέ σʼ ἀνήγαγον αὐτοί, οὖλέ τε καὶ μάλα χαῖρε, θεοὶ δέ τοι ὄλβια δοῖεν. καί μοι τοῦτʼ ἀγόρευσον ἐτήτυμον, ὄφρʼ ἐῢ εἰδῶ, ἢ ἤδη σάφα οἶδε περίφρων Πηνελόπεια νοστήσαντά σε δεῦρʼ, ἦ ἄγγελον ὀτρύνωμεν. τὸν δʼ ἀπαμειβόμενος προσέφη πολύμητις Ὀδυσσεύς
"""Old man,"" answered Odysseus, ""she knows already, so you need not trouble about that."" On this he took his seat, and the sons of Dolios gathered round Odysseus to give him greeting and embrace him one after the other; then they took their seats in due order near Dolios their father."	ὦ γέρον, ἤδη οἶδε· τί σε χρὴ ταῦτα πένεσθαι; ὣς φάθʼ, ὁ δʼ αὖτις ἄρʼ ἕζετʼ ἐϋξέστου ἐπὶ δίφρου. ὣς δʼ αὔτως παῖδες Δολίου κλυτὸν ἀμφʼ Ὀδυσῆα δεικανόωντʼ ἐπέεσσι καὶ ἐν χείρεσσι φύοντο, ἑξείης δʼ ἕζοντο παραὶ Δολίον, πατέρα σφόν.
"While they were thus busy getting their dinner ready, Rumor went round the town, and noised abroad the terrible fate that had befallen the suitors; as soon, therefore, as the people heard of it they gathered from every quarter, groaning and hooting before the house of Odysseus. They took the dead away, buried every man his own, and put the bodies of those who came from elsewhere on board the fishing vessels, for the fishermen to take each of them to his own place. They then met angrily in the place of assembly, and when they were got together Eupeithes rose to speak. He was overwhelmed with grief   for the death of his son Antinoos, who had been the first man killed by Odysseus, so he said, weeping bitterly, ""My friend, this man has done the Achaeans great wrong. He took many of our best men away with him in his fleet, and he has lost both ships and men; now, moreover, on his return he has been killing all the foremost men among the Cephallênians. Let us be up and doing before he can get away to Pylos or to Elis where the Epeans rule, or we shall be ashamed of ourselves for ever afterwards. It will be an everlasting disgrace to us if we do not avenge the murder of our sons and brothers. For my own part I should have no more pleasure in life, but had rather die at once. Let us be up, then, and after them, before they can cross over to the mainland."""	ὣς οἱ μὲν περὶ δεῖπνον ἐνὶ μεγάροισι πένοντο· Ὄσσα δʼ ἄρʼ ἄγγελος ὦκα κατὰ πτόλιν ᾤχετο πάντη, μνηστήρων στυγερὸν θάνατον καὶ κῆρʼ ἐνέπουσα. οἱ δʼ ἄρʼ ὁμῶς ἀΐοντες ἐφοίτων ἄλλοθεν ἄλλος μυχμῷ τε στοναχῇ τε δόμων προπάροιθʼ Ὀδυσῆος, ἐκ δὲ νέκυς οἴκων φόρεον καὶ θάπτον ἕκαστοι, τοὺς δʼ ἐξ ἀλλάων πολίων οἶκόνδε ἕκαστον πέμπον ἄγειν ἁλιεῦσι θοῇς ἐπὶ νηυσὶ τιθέντες· αὐτοὶ δʼ εἰς ἀγορὴν κίον ἀθρόοι, ἀχνύμενοι κῆρ. αὐτὰρ ἐπεί ῥʼ ἤγερθεν ὁμηγερέες τʼ ἐγένοντο, τοῖσιν δʼ Εὐπείθης ἀνά θʼ ἵστατο καὶ μετέειπε· παιδὸς γάρ οἱ ἄλαστον ἐνὶ φρεσὶ πένθος ἔκειτο, Ἀντινόου, τὸν πρῶτον ἐνήρατο δῖος Ὀδυσσεύς· τοῦ ὅ γε δάκρυ χέων ἀγορήσατο καὶ μετέειπεν· ὦ φίλοι, ἦ μέγα ἔργον ἀνὴρ ὅδʼ ἐμήσατʼ Ἀχαιούς· τοὺς μὲν σὺν νήεσσιν ἄγων πολέας τε καὶ ἐσθλοὺς ὤλεσε μὲν νῆας γλαφυράς, ἀπὸ δʼ ὤλεσε λαούς· τοὺς δʼ ἐλθὼν ἔκτεινε Κεφαλλήνων ὄχʼ ἀρίστους, ἀλλʼ ἄγετε, πρὶν τοῦτον ἢ ἐς Πύλον ὦκα ἱκέσθαι ἢ καὶ ἐς Ἤλιδα δῖαν, ὅθι κρατέουσιν Ἐπειοί, ἴομεν· ἦ καὶ ἔπειτα κατηφέες ἐσσόμεθʼ αἰεί· λώβη γὰρ τάδε γʼ ἐστὶ καὶ ἐσσομένοισι πυθέσθαι, εἰ δὴ μὴ παίδων τε κασιγνήτων τε φονῆας τισόμεθʼ. οὐκ ἂν ἐμοί γε μετὰ φρεσὶν ἡδὺ γένοιτο ζωέμεν, ἀλλὰ τάχιστα θανὼν φθιμένοισι μετείην. ἀλλʼ ἴομεν, μὴ φθέωσι περαιωθέντες ἐκεῖνοι.
"He wept as he spoke and every one pitied him. But Medon and the bard Phemios had now woke up, and came to them from the house of Odysseus. Every one was astonished at seeing them, but they stood in the middle of the assembly, and Medon said, ""Hear me, men of Ithaca . Odysseus did not do these things against the will of heaven. I myself saw an immortal god take the form of Mentor and stand beside him. This god appeared, now in front of him encouraging him, and now going furiously about the court and attacking the suitors whereon they fell thick on one another."""	ὣς φάτο δάκρυ χέων, οἶκτος δʼ ἕλε πάντας Ἀχαιούς. ἀγχίμολον δέ σφʼ ἦλθε Μέδων καὶ θεῖος ἀοιδὸς ἐκ μεγάρων Ὀδυσῆος, ἐπεί σφεας ὕπνος ἀνῆκεν, ἔσταν δʼ ἐν μέσσοισι· τάφος δʼ ἕλεν ἄνδρα ἕκαστον. τοῖσι δὲ καὶ μετέειπε Μέδων πεπνυμένα εἰδώς· κέκλυτε δὴ νῦν μευ, Ἰθακήσιοι· οὐ γὰρ Ὀδυσσεὺς ἀθανάτων ἀέκητι θεῶν τάδʼ ἐμήσατο ἔργα· αὐτὸς ἐγὼν εἶδον θεὸν ἄμβροτον, ὅς ῥʼ Ὀδυσῆϊ ἐγγύθεν ἑστήκει καὶ Μέντορι πάντα ἐῴκει. ἀθάνατος δὲ θεὸς τοτὲ μὲν προπάροιθʼ Ὀδυσῆος φαίνετο θαρσύνων, τοτὲ δὲ μνηστῆρας ὀρίνων θῦνε κατὰ μέγαρον· τοὶ δʼ ἀγχιστῖνοι ἔπιπτον.
On this pale fear laid hold of them, and old Halitherses, son of Mastor, rose to speak, for he was the only man among them who knew both past and future; so he spoke to them plainly and in all honesty, saying,	ὣς φάτο, τοὺς δʼ ἄρα πάντας ὑπὸ χλωρὸν δέος ᾕρει. τοῖσι δὲ καὶ μετέειπε γέρων ἥρως Ἁλιθέρσης Μαστορίδης· ὁ γὰρ οἶος ὅρα πρόσσω καὶ ὀπίσσω· ὅ σφιν ἐϋφρονέων ἀγορήσατο καὶ μετέειπε·
"""Men of Ithaca , it is all your own fault that things have turned out as they have; you would not listen to me, nor yet to Mentor, when we bade you check the folly of your sons who were doing much wrong in the wantonness of their hearts - wasting the substance and dishonoring the wife of a chieftain who they thought would not return. Now, however, let it be as I say, and do as I tell you. Do not go out against Odysseus, or you may find that you have been drawing down evil on your own heads."""	κέκλυτε δὴ νῦν μευ, Ἰθακήσιοι, ὅττι κεν εἴπω· ὑμετέρῃ κακότητι, φίλοι, τάδε ἔργα γένοντο· οὐ γὰρ ἐμοὶ πείθεσθʼ, οὐ Μέντορι ποιμένι λαῶν, ὑμετέρους παῖδας καταπαυέμεν ἀφροσυνάων, οἳ μέγα ἔργον ἔρεξαν ἀτασθαλίῃσι κακῇσι, κτήματα κείροντες καὶ ἀτιμάζοντες ἄκοιτιν ἀνδρὸς ἀριστῆος· τὸν δʼ οὐκέτι φάντο νέεσθαι. καὶ νῦν ὧδε γένοιτο. πίθεσθέ μοι ὡς ἀγορεύω· μὴ ἴομεν, μή πού τις ἐπίσπαστον κακὸν εὕρῃ.
This was what he said, and more than half raised a loud shout, and at once left the assembly. But the rest stayed where they were, for the speech of Halitherses displeased them, and they sided with Eupeithes; they therefore hurried off for their armor, and when they had armed themselves, they met together in front of the city, and Eupeithes led them on in their folly. He thought he was going to avenge the murder of his son, whereas in truth he was never to return, but was himself to perish in his attempt.	ὣς ἔφαθʼ, οἱ δʼ ἄρʼ ἀνήϊξαν μεγάλῳ ἀλαλητῷ ἡμίσεων πλείους· τοὶ δʼ ἀθρόοι αὐτόθι μίμνον· οὐ γὰρ σφιν ἅδε μῦθος ἐνὶ φρεσίν, ἀλλʼ Εὐπείθει πείθοντʼ· αἶψα δʼ ἔπειτʼ ἐπὶ τεύχεα ἐσσεύοντο. αὐτὰρ ἐπεί ῥʼ ἕσσαντο περὶ χροῒ νώροπα χαλκόν, ἀθρόοι ἠγερέθοντο πρὸ ἄστεος εὐρυχόροιο. τοῖσιν δʼ Εὐπείθης ἡγήσατο νηπιέῃσι· φῆ δʼ ὅ γε τίσεσθαι παιδὸς φόνον, οὐδʼ ἄρʼ ἔμελλεν ἂψ ἀπονοστήσειν, ἀλλʼ αὐτοῦ πότμον ἐφέψειν.
"Then Athena said to Zeus, ""Father, son of Kronos, king of kings, answer me this question - What does your bid you? Will you set them fighting still further, or will you make peace between them?"""	αὐτὰρ Ἀθηναίη Ζῆνα Κρονίωνα προσηύδα· ὦ πάτερ ἡμέτερε, Κρονίδη, ὕπατε κρειόντων, εἰπέ μοι εἰρομένῃ, τί νύ τοι νόος ἔνδοθι κεύθει; ἢ προτέρω πόλεμόν τε κακὸν καὶ φύλοπιν αἰνὴν τεύξεις, ἦ φιλότητα μετʼ ἀμφοτέροισι τίθησθα;
"And Zeus answered, ""My child, why should you ask me? Was it not by your own arrangement   that Odysseus came home and took his revenge upon the suitors? Do whatever you like, but I will tell you what I think will be the most reasonable arrangement. Now that Odysseus is revenged, let them swear to a solemn covenant, in virtue of which he shall continue to rule, while we cause the others to forgive and forget the massacre of their sons and brothers. Let them then all become friends as heretofore, and let peace and plenty reign."""	τὴν δʼ ἀπαμειβόμενος προσέφη νεφεληγερέτα Ζεύς· τέκνον ἐμόν, τί με ταῦτα διείρεαι ἠδὲ μεταλλᾷς; οὐ γὰρ δὴ τοῦτον μὲν ἐβούλευσας νόον αὐτή, ὡς ἦ τοι κείνους Ὀδυσεὺς ἀποτίσεται ἐλθών; ἔρξον ὅπως ἐθέλεις· ἐρέω τέ τοι ὡς ἐπέοικεν. ἐπεὶ δὴ μνηστῆρας ἐτίσατο δῖος Ὀδυσσεύς, ὅρκια πιστὰ ταμόντες ὁ μὲν βασιλευέτω αἰεί, ἡμεῖς δʼ αὖ παίδων τε κασιγνήτων τε φόνοιο ἔκλησιν θέωμεν· τοὶ δʼ ἀλλήλους φιλεόντων ὡς τὸ πάρος, πλοῦτος δὲ καὶ εἰρήνη ἅλις ἔστω.
This was what Athena was already eager to bring about, so down she darted from off the topmost summits of Olympus .	ὣς εἰπὼν ὤτρυνε πάρος μεμαυῖαν Ἀθήνην, βῆ δὲ κατʼ Οὐλύμποιο καρήνων ἀΐξασα.
"Now when Laertes and the others had done dinner, Odysseus began by saying, ""Some of you go out and see if they are not getting close up to us."" So one of Dolios’ sons went as he was bid. Standing on the threshold he could see them all quite near, and said to Odysseus, ""Here they are, let us put on our armor at once."""	οἱ δʼ ἐπεὶ οὖν σίτοιο μελίφρονος ἐξ ἔρον ἕντο, τοῖς δʼ ἄρα μύθων ἦρχε πολύτλας δῖος Ὀδυσσεύς· ἐξελθών τις ἴδοι μὴ δὴ σχεδὸν ὦσι κιόντες. ὣς ἔφατʼ· ἐκ δʼ υἱὸς Δολίου κίεν, ὡς ἐκέλευεν· στῆ δʼ ἄρʼ ἐπʼ οὐδὸν ἰών, τοὺς δὲ σχεδὸν ἔσιδε πάντας· αἶψα δʼ Ὀδυσσῆα ἔπεα πτερόεντα προσηύδα· οἵδε δὴ ἐγγὺς ἔασʼ· ἀλλʼ ὁπλιζώμεθα θᾶσσον.
They put on their armor as fast as they could - that is to say Odysseus, his three men, and the six sons of Dolios. Laertes also and Dolios did the same - warriors by necessity in spite of their gray hair. When they had all put on their armor, they opened the gate and sallied forth, Odysseus leading the way.	ὣς ἔφαθʼ, οἱ δʼ ὤρνυντο καὶ ἐν τεύχεσσι δύοντο, τέσσαρες ἀμφʼ Ὀδυσῆʼ, ἓξ δʼ υἱεῖς οἱ Δολίοιο· ἐν δʼ ἄρα Λαέρτης Δολίος τʼ ἐς τεύχεʼ ἔδυνον, καὶ πολιοί περ ἐόντες, ἀναγκαῖοι πολεμισταί. αὐτὰρ ἐπεί ῥʼ ἕσσαντο περὶ χροῒ νώροπα χαλκόν, ὤϊξάν ῥα θύρας, ἐκ δʼ ἤϊον, ἄρχε δʼ Ὀδυσσεύς.
"Then Zeus’ daughter Athena came up to them, having assumed the form and voice of Mentor. Odysseus was glad when he saw her, and said to his son Telemakhos, ""Telemakhos, now that you are about to fight in an engagement, which will show every man's mettle, be sure not to disgrace your ancestors, who were eminent for their strength and courage all the world over."""	τοῖσι δʼ ἐπʼ ἀγχίμολον θυγάτηρ Διὸς ἦλθεν Ἀθήνη Μέντορι εἰδομένη ἠμὲν δέμας ἠδὲ καὶ αὐδήν. τὴν μὲν ἰδὼν γήθησε πολύτλας δῖος Ὀδυσσεύς· αἶψα δὲ Τηλέμαχον προσεφώνεεν ὃν φίλον υἱόν· Τηλέμαχʼ, ἤδη μὲν τόδε γʼ εἴσεαι αὐτὸς ἐπελθών, ἀνδρῶν μαρναμένων ἵνα τε κρίνονται ἄριστοι, μή τι καταισχύνειν πατέρων γένος, οἳ τὸ πάρος περ ἀλκῇ τʼ ἠνορέῃ τε κεκάσμεθα πᾶσαν ἐπʼ αἶαν.
"""You say truly, my dear father,"" answered Telemakhos, ""and you shall see, if you will, that I am in no mind to disgrace your family."""	τὸν δʼ αὖ Τηλέμαχος πεπνυμένος ἀντίον ηὔδα· ὄψεαι, αἴ κʼ ἐθέλῃσθα, πάτερ φίλε, τῷδʼ ἐπὶ θυμῷ οὔ τι καταισχύνοντα τεὸν γένος, ὡς ἀγορεύεις.
"Laertes was delighted when he heard this. ""Good heavens, he exclaimed, ""what a day I am enjoying: I do indeed rejoice at it. My son and grandson are vying with one another in the matter of valor  ."""	ὣς φάτο, Λαέρτης δʼ ἐχάρη καὶ μῦθον ἔειπε· τίς νύ μοι ἡμέρη ἥδε, θεοὶ φίλοι; ἦ μάλα χαίρω· υἱός θʼ υἱωνός τʼ ἀρετῆς πέρι δῆριν ἔχουσιν.
"On this Athena came close up to him and said, ""Son of Arceisius - best friend I have in the world - pray to the gray-eyed damsel, and to Zeus her father; then poise your spear and hurl it."""	τὸν δὲ παρισταμένη προσέφη γλαυκῶπις Ἀθήνη· ὦ Ἀρκεισιάδη, πάντων πολὺ φίλταθʼ ἑταίρων, εὐξάμενος κούρῃ γλαυκώπιδι καὶ Διὶ πατρί, αἶψα μαλʼ ἀμπεπαλὼν προΐει δολιχόσκιον ἔγχος.
"As she spoke she infused fresh vigor into him, and when he had prayed to her he poised his spear and hurled it. He hit Eupeithes’ helmet, and the spear went right through it, for the helmet stayed it not, and his armor rang rattling round him as he fell heavily to the ground. Meantime Odysseus and his son fell the front line of the foe and smote them with their swords and spears; indeed, they would have killed every one of them, and prevented them from ever getting home again, only Athena raised her voice aloud, and made every one pause. ""Men of Ithaca ,"" she cried, ""cease this dreadful war, and settle the matter at once without further bloodshed."""	ὣς φάτο, καί ῥʼ ἔμπνευσε μένος μέγα Παλλὰς Ἀθήνη εὐξάμενος δʼ ἄρʼ ἔπειτα Διὸς κούρῃ μεγάλοιο, αἶψα μάλʼ ἀμπεπαλὼν προΐει δολιχόσκιον ἔγχος, καὶ βάλεν Εὐπείθεα κόρυθος διὰ χαλκοπαρῄου. ἡ δʼ οὐκ ἔγχος ἔρυτο, διαπρὸ δὲ εἴσατο χαλκός, δούπησεν δὲ πεσών, ἀράβησε δὲ τεύχεʼ ἐπʼ αὐτῷ. ἐν δʼ ἔπεσον προμάχοις Ὀδυσεὺς καὶ φαίδιμος υἱός, τύπτον δὲ ξίφεσίν τε καὶ ἔγχεσιν ἀμφιγύοισι. καί νύ κε δὴ πάντας ὄλεσαν καὶ ἔθηκαν ἀνόστους, εἰ μὴ Ἀθηναίη, κούρη Διὸς αἰγιόχοιο, ἤϋσεν φωνῇ, κατὰ ἔσχεθε λαὸν ἅπαντα. ἴσχεσθε πτολέμου, Ἰθακήσιοι, ἀργαλέοιο, ὥς κεν ἀναιμωτί γε διακρινθῆτε τάχιστα.
"On this pale fear seized every one; they were so frightened that their arms dropped from their hands and fell upon the ground at the sound of the goddess’ voice, and they fled back to the city for their lives. But Odysseus gave a great cry, and gathering himself together swooped down like a soaring eagle. Then the son of Kronos sent a thunderbolt of fire that fell just in front of Athena, so she said to Odysseus, ""Odysseus, noble son of Laertes, stop this warful strife, or Zeus will be angry with you."""	ὣς φάτʼ Ἀθηναίη, τοὺς δὲ χλωρὸν δέος εἷλεν· τῶν δʼ ἄρα δεισάντων ἐκ χειρῶν ἔπτατο τεύχεα, πάντα δʼ ἐπὶ χθονὶ πῖπτε, θεᾶς ὄπα φωνησάσης· πρὸς δὲ πόλιν τρωπῶντο λιλαιόμενοι βιότοιο. σμερδαλέον δʼ ἐβόησε πολύτλας δῖος Ὀδυσσεύς, οἴμησεν δὲ ἀλεὶς ὥς τʼ αἰετὸς ὑψιπετήεις. καὶ τότε δὴ Κρονίδης ἀφίει ψολόεντα κεραυνόν, κὰδ δʼ ἔπεσε πρόσθε γλαυκώπιδος ὀβριμοπάτρης. δὴ τότʼ Ὀδυσσῆα προσέφη γλαυκῶπις Ἀθήνη· διογενὲς Λαερτιάδη, πολυμήχανʼ Ὀδυσσεῦ, ἴσχεο, παῦε δὲ νεῖκος ὁμοιΐου πολέμοιο, μή πως τοι Κρονίδης κεχολώσεται εὐρύοπα Ζεύς.
Thus spoke Athena, and Odysseus obeyed her gladly. Then Athena assumed the form and voice of Mentor, and presently made a covenant of peace between the two contending parties.	ὣς φάτʼ Ἀθηναίη, ὁ δʼ ἐπείθετο, χαῖρε δὲ θυμῷ. ὅρκια δʼ αὖ κατόπισθε μετʼ ἀμφοτέροισιν ἔθηκεν Παλλὰς Ἀθηναίη, κούρη Διὸς αἰγιόχοιο,
Or like her who left home and country and came to Thebes, following warlike Amphitryon,—even Alcmena, the daughter of Electryon, gatherer of the people. She surpassed the tribe of womankind	ἢ οἵη προλιποῦσα δόμους καὶ πατρίδα γαῖαν ἤλυθεν ἐς Θήβας μετʼ ἀρήιον Ἀμφιτρύωνα Ἀλκμήνη, θυγάτηρ λαοσσόου Ἠλεκτρύωνος· ἥ ῥα γυναικῶν φῦλον ἐκαίνυτο θηλυτεράων
in beauty and in height; and in wisdom none vied with her of those whom mortal women bore of union with mortal men. Her face and her dark eyes wafted such charm as comes from golden Aphrodite. And she so honored her husband in her heart	εἴδεΐ τε μεγέθει τε· νόον γε μὲν οὔ τις ἔριζε τάων, ἃς θνηταὶ θνητοῖς τέκον εὐνηθεῖσαι. τῆς καὶ ἀπὸ κρῆθεν βλεφάρων τʼ ἄπο κυανεάων τοῖον ἄηθʼ οἶόν τε πολυχρύσου Ἀφροδίτης. ἣ δὲ καὶ ὣς κατὰ θυμὸν ἑὸν τίεσκεν ἀκοίτην,
as none of womankind did before her. In truth he had slain her noble father violently when he was angry about oxen; so he left his own country and came to Thebes and was suppliant to the shield-carrying men of Cadmus. There he dwelt with his modest wife	ὡς οὔ πώ τις ἔτισε γυναικῶν θηλυτεράων· ἦ μέν οἱ πατέρʼ ἐσθλὸν ἀπέκτανε ἶφι δαμάσσας, χωσάμενος περὶ βουσί· λιπὼν δʼ ὅ γε πατρίδα γαῖαν ἐς Θήβας ἱκέτευσε φερεσσακέας Καδμείους. ἔνθʼ ὅ γε δώματʼ ἔναιε σὺν αἰδοίῃ παρακοίτι
without the joys of love, nor might he go in unto the neat-ankled daughter of Electryon until he had avenged the death of his wife's great-hearted brothers and utterly burned with blazing fire the villages of the heroes, the Taphians and Teleboans;	νόσφιν ἄτερ φιλότητος ἐφιμέρου, οὐδέ οἱ ἦεν πρὶν λεχέων ἐπιβῆναι ἐυσφύρου Ἠλεκτρυώνης, πρίν γε φόνον τίσαιτο κασιγνήτων μεγαθύμων ἧς ἀλόχου, μαλερῷ δὲ καταφλέξαι πυρὶ κώμας ἀνδρῶν ἡρώων Ταφίων ἰδὲ Τηλεβοάων.
for this thing was laid upon him, and the gods were witnesses to it. And he feared their anger, and hastened to perform the great task to which Zeus had bound him. With him went the horse-driving Boeotians, breathing above their shields,	τὼς γάρ οἱ διέκειτο, θεοὶ δʼ ἐπὶ μάρτυροι ἦσαν· τῶν ὅ γʼ ὀπίζετο μῆνιν, ἐπείγετο δʼ ὅττι τάχιστα ἐκτελέσαι μέγα ἔργον, ὅ οἱ Διόθεν θέμις ἦεν. τῷ δʼ ἅμα ἱέμενοι πολέμοιό τε φυλόπιδός τε Βοιωτοὶ πλήξιπποι, ὑπὲρ σακέων πνείοντες,
and the Locrians who fight hand to hand, and the gallant Phocians eager for war and battle. And the noble son of Alcaeus led them, rejoicing in his host. But the father of men and gods was forming another scheme in his heart, to beget one to defend against destruction gods and men who eat bread.	Λοκροί τʼ ἀγχέμαχοι καὶ Φωκῆες μεγάθυμοι ἕσποντʼ· ἦρχε δὲ τοῖσιν ἐὺς πάις Ἀλκαίοιο κυδιόων λαοῖσι. πατὴρ δʼ ἀνδρῶν τε θεῶν τε ἄλλην μῆτιν ὕφαινε μετὰ φρεσίν, ὥς ῥα θεοῖσιν ἀνδράσι τʼ ἀλφηστῇσιν ἀρῆς ἀλκτῆρα φυτεύσαι.
So he arose from Olympus by night pondering guile in the deep of his heart, and yearned for the love of the well-girded woman. Quickly he came to Typhaonium, and from there again wise Zeus went on and trod the highest peak of Phicium: there he sat and planned marvellous things in his heart.	ὦρτο δʼ ἀπʼ Οὐλύμποιο δόλον φρεσὶ βυσσοδομεύων, ἱμείρων φιλότητος ἐυζώνοιο γυναικός, ἐννύχιος· τάχα δʼ ἷξε Τυφαόνιον· τόθεν αὖτις Φίκιον ἀκρότατον προσεβήσατο μητίετα Ζεύς. ἔνθα καθεζόμενος φρεσὶ μήδετο θέσκελα ἔργα·
So in one night Zeus shared the bed and love of the neat-ankled daughter of Electryon and fulfilled his desire; and in the same night Amphitryon, gatherer of the people, the glorious hero, came to his house when he had ended his great task.	αὐτῇ μὲν γὰρ νυκτὶ τανυσφύρου Ἠλεκτρυώνης εὐνῇ καὶ φιλότητι μίγη, τέλεσεν δʼ ἄρʼ ἐέλδωρ· αὐτῇ δʼ Ἀμφιτρύων λαοσσόος, ἀγλαὸς ἥρως, ἐκτελέσας μέγα ἔργον ἀφίκετο ὅνδε δόμονδε.
He hastened not to go to his bondmen and shepherds afield,	οὐδʼ ὅ γʼ ἐπὶ δμῶας καὶ ποιμένας ἀγροιώτας
but first went in to his wife: such desire took hold on the shepherd of the people. And as a man who has escaped joyfully from misery, whether of sore disease or cruel bondage, so then did Amphitryon, when he had wound up all his heavy task,	ὦρτʼ ἰέναι, πρίν γʼ ἧς ἀλόχου ἐπιβήμεναι εὐνῆς· τοῖος γὰρ κραδίην πόθος αἴνυτο ποιμένα λαῶν. ὡς δʼ ὅτʼ ἀνὴρ ἀσπαστὸν ὑπεκπροφύγῃ κακότητα νούσου ὕπʼ ἀργαλέης ἢ καὶ κρατεροῦ ὑπὸ δεσμοῦ, ὥς ῥα τότʼ Ἀμφιτρύων χαλεπὸν πόνον ἐκτολυπεύσας
come glad and welcome to his home. And all night long he lay with his modest wife, delighting in the gifts of golden Aphrodite. And she, being subject in love to a god and to a man exceeding goodly, brought forth twin sons in seven-gated Thebes .	ἀσπασίως τε φίλως τε ἑὸν δόμον εἰσαφίκανεν. παννύχιος δʼ ἄρʼ ἔλεκτο σὺν αἰδοίῃ παρακοίτι τερπόμενος δώροισι πολυχρύσου Ἀφροδίτης. ἣ δὲ θεῷ δμηθεῖσα καὶ ἀνέρι πολλὸν ἀρίστῳ Θήβῃ ἐν ἑπταπύλῳ διδυμάονε γείνατο παῖδε,
Though they were brothers, these were not of one spirit; for one was weaker but the other a far better man, one terrible and strong, the mighty Heracles. She bore him through the embrace of the son of Cronos lord of dark clouds and the other, Iphicles, of Amphitryon the spear-wielder—	οὐ καθʼ ὁμὰ φρονέοντε· κασιγνήτω γε μὲν ἤστην· τὸν μὲν χειρότερον, τὸν δʼ αὖ μέγʼ ἀμείνονα φῶτα, δεινόν τε κρατερόν τε, βίην Ἡρακληείην· τὸν μὲν ὑποδμηθεῖσα κελαινεφέι Κρονίωνι, τὸν δʼ ἄρα Ἰφικλῆα δορυσσόῳ Ἀμφιτρύωνι,
offspring distinct, this one of union with a mortal man, but that other of union with Zeus, leader of all the gods. And he slew Cycnus, the gallant son of Ares. For he found him in the precinct of far-shooting Apollo, him and his father Ares, never sated with war.	κεκριμένην γενεήν· τὸν μὲν βροτῷ ἀνδρὶ μιγεῖσα, τὸν δὲ Διὶ Κρονίωνι, θεῶν σημάντορι πάντων. ὃς καὶ Κύκνον ἔπεφνεν, Ἀρητιάδην μεγάθυμον. εὗρε γὰρ ἐν τεμένει ἑκατηβόλου Ἀπόλλωνος αὐτὸν καὶ πατέρα ὅν Ἄρην, ἄατον πολέμοιο,
Their armour shone like a flame of blazing fire as they two stood in their chariot: their swift horses struck the earth and pawed it with their hoofs, and the dust rose like smoke about them, pounded by the chariot wheels and the horses' hoofs, while the well-made chariot and its rails rattled around them	τεύχεσι λαμπομένους σέλας ὣς πυρὸς αἰθομένοιο, ἑσταότʼ ἐν δίφρῳ· χθόνα δʼ ἔκτυπον ὠκέες ἵπποι νύσσοντες χηλῇσι, κόνις δέ σφʼ ἀμφιδεδήει κοπτομένη πλεκτοῖσιν ὑφʼ ἅρμασι καὶ ποσὶν ἵππων. ἅρματα δʼ εὐποίητα καὶ ἄντυγες ἀμφαράβιζον
as the horses plunged. And blameless Cycnus was glad, for he hoped to slay the warlike son of Zeus and his charioteer with the sword, and to strip off their splendid armour. But Phoebus Apollo would not listen to his vaunts, for he himself had stirred up mighty Heracles against him.	ἵππων ἱεμένων· κεχάρητο δὲ Κύκνος ἀμύμων, ἐλπόμενος Διὸς υἱὸν ἀρήιον ἡνίοχόν τε χαλκῷ δηιώσειν καὶ ἀπὸ κλυτὰ τεύχεα δύσειν. ἀλλά οἱ εὐχωλέων οὐκ ἔκλυε Φοῖβος Ἀπόλλων· αὐτὸς γάρ οἱ ἐπῶρσε βίην Ἡρακληείην.
And all the grove and altar of Pagasaean Apollo flamed because of the dread god and because of his arms; for his eyes flashed as with fire. What mortal man would have dared to meet him face to face save Heracles and glorious Iolaus?	πᾶν δʼ ἄλσος καὶ βωμὸς Ἀπόλλωνος Παγασαίου λάμπεν ὑπὸ δεινοῖο θεοῦ τευχέων τε καὶ αὐτοῦ· πῦρ δʼ ὣς ὀφθαλμῶν ἀπελάμπετο. τίς κεν ἐκείνου ἔτλη θνητὸς ἐὼν κατεναντίον ὁρμηθῆναι πλήν γʼ Ἡρακλῆος καὶ κυδαλίμου Ἰολάου;
For great was their strength and unconquerable were the arms which grew from their shoulders on their strong limbs. Then Heracles spake to his charioteer strong Iolaus:	κείνων γὰρ μεγάλη τε βίη καὶ χεῖρες ἄαπτοι ἐξ ὤμων ἐπέφυκον ἐπὶ στιβαροῖσι μέλεσσιν. ὅς ῥα τόθʼ ἡνίοχον προσέφη κρατερὸν Ἰόλαον·
“O hero Iolaus, best beloved of all men, truly Amphitryon sinned deeply against the blessed gods who dwell on Olympus	ἥρως ὦ Ἰόλαε, βροτῶν πολὺ φίλτατε πάντων, ἦ τε μέγʼ ἀθανάτους μάκαρας, τοὶ Ὄλυμπον ἔχουσιν,
when he came to sweet-crowned Thebes and left Tiryns , the well-built citadel, because he slew Electryon for the sake of his wide-browed oxen. Then he came to Creon and long-robed Eniocha, who received him kindly and gave him all fitting things,	ἤλιτεν Ἀμφιτρύων, ὅτʼ ἐυστέφανον ποτὶ Θήβην ἦλθε λιπὼν Τίρυνθα, ἐυκτίμενον πτολίεθρον, κτείνας Ἠλεκτρύωνα βοῶν ἕνεκʼ εὐρυμετώπων· ἵκετο δʼ ἐς Κρείοντα καὶ Ἠνιόχην τανύπεπλον, οἵ ῥά μιν ἠσπάζοντο καὶ ἄρμενα πάντα παρεῖχον,
as is due to suppliants, and honored him in their hearts even more. And he lived joyfully with his wife the neat-ankled daughter of Electryon: and presently, while the years rolled on, we were born, unlike in body as in mind, even your father and I. From him Zeus took away sense, so that he left his home and his parents	ἣ δίκη ἔσθʼ ἱκέτῃσι, τίον δέ ἑ κηρόθι μᾶλλον. ζῶε δʼ ἀγαλλόμενος σὺν ἐυσφύρῳ Ἠλεκτρυώνῃ, ᾗ ἀλόχῳ· τάχα δʼ ἄμμες ἐπιπλομένων ἐνιαυτῶν γεινόμεθʼ οὔτε φυὴν ἐναλίγκιοι οὔτε νόημα, σός τε πατὴρ καὶ ἐγώ· τοῦ μὲν φρένας ἐξέλετο Ζεύς,
and went to do honor to the wicked Eurystheus—unhappy man! Deeply indeed did he grieve afterwards in bearing the burden of his own mad folly; but that cannot be taken back. But on me fate laid heavy tasks.	ὃς προλιπὼν σφέτερον τε δόμον σφετέρους τε τοκῆας ᾤχετο, τιμήσων ἀλιτήμενον Εὐρυσθῆα, σχέτλιος· ἦ που πολλὰ μετεστεναχίζετʼ ὀπίσσω ἣν ἄτην ὀχέων· ἣ δʼ οὐ παλινάγρετός ἐστιν. αὐτὰρ ἐμοὶ δαίμων χαλεποὺς ἐπετέλλετʼ ἀέθλους.
“Yet, come, friend, quickly take the red-dyed reins of the swift horses and raise high courage in your heart and guide the swift chariot and strong fleet-footed horses straight on. Have no secret fear at the noise of man-slaying Ares who now rages shouting about the holy grove	ὦ φίλος, ἀλλὰ σὺ θᾶσσον ἔχʼ ἡνία φοινικόεντα ἵππων ὠκυπόδων· μέγα δὲ φρεσὶ θάρσος ἀέξων ἰθὺς ἔχειν θοὸν ἅρμα καὶ ὠκυπόδων σθένος ἵππων, μηδὲν ὑποδδείσας κτύπον Ἄρεος ἀνδροφόνοιο, ὃς νῦν κεκληγὼς περιμαίνεται ἱερὸν ἄλσος
of Phoebus Apollo, the lord who shoots from afar. Surely, strong though he be, he will have enough of war.” And blameless Iolaus answered him again: “Good friend, truly the father of men and gods greatly honors your head and the bull-like Earth-Shaker also,	Φοίβου Ἀπόλλωνος, ἑκατηβελέταο ἄνακτος· ἦ μὴν καὶ κρατερός περ ἐὼν ἄαται πολέμοιο. τὸν δʼ αὖτε προσέειπεν ἀμώμητος Ἰόλαος· ἠθεῖʼ, ἦ μάλα δή τι πατὴρ ἀνδρῶν τε θεῶν τε τιμᾷ σὴν κεφαλὴν καὶ ταύρεος Ἐννοσίγαιος,
who keeps Thebe's veil of walls and guards the city,—so great and strong is this fellow they bring into your hands that you may win great glory. But come, put on your arms of war that with all speed we may bring the car of Ares and our own together and	ὃς Θήβης κρήδεμνον ἔχει ῥύεταί τε πόληα· οἶον δὴ καὶ τόνδε βροτὸν κρατερόν τε μέγαν τε σὰς ἐς χεῖρας ἄγουσιν, ἵνα κλέος ἐσθλὸν ἄρηαι. ἀλλʼ ἄγε δύσεο τεύχεʼ ἀρήια, ὄφρα τάχιστα δίφρους ἐμπελάσαντες Ἄρηός θʼ ἡμέτερόν τε
fight; for he shall not frighten the dauntless son of Zeus, nor yet the son of Iphiclus: rather I think he will flee before the two sons of blameless Alcides who are near him and eager to raise the war cry for battle; for this they love better than a feast.”	μαρνώμεσθʼ, ἐπεὶ οὔ τοι ἀτάρβητον Διὸς υἱὸν οὐδʼ Ἰφικλεΐδην δειδίξεται, ἀλλά μιν οἴω φεύξεσθαι δύο παῖδας ἀμύμονος Ἀλκεΐδαο, οἳ δή σφι σχεδόν εἰσι, λιλαιόμενοι πολέμοιο φυλόπιδα στῆσαι, τά σφιν πολὺ φίλτερα θοίνης.
So he said. And mighty Heracles was glad in heart and smiled, for the other's words pleased him well, and he answered him with winged words: “O hero Iolaus, heaven-sprung, now is rough battle hard at hand.	ὣς φάτο· μείδησεν δὲ βίη Ἡρακληείη θυμῷ γηθήσας· μάλα γάρ νύ οἱ ἄρμενα εἶπεν· καί μιν ἀμειβόμενος ἔπεα πτερόεντα προσηύδα· ἥρως ὦ Ἰόλαε, διοτρεφές, οὐκέτι τηλοῦ ὑσμίνη τρηχεῖα· σὺ δʼ ὡς πάρος ἦσθα δαΐφρων,
But, as you have shown your skill at other times, so now also wheel the great black-maned horse Arion about every way, and help me as you may be able.” So he said, and put upon his legs greaves of shining bronze, the splendid gift of Hephaestus. Next he fastened about his breast	ὣς καὶ νῦν μέγαν ἵππον Ἀρίονα κυανοχαίτην πάντη ἀναστρωφᾶν καὶ ἀρηγέμεν, ὥς κε δύνηαι. ὣς εἰπὼν κνημῖδας ὀρειχάλκοιο φαεινοῦ, Ἡφαίστου κλυτὰ δῶρα, περὶ κνήμῃσιν ἔθηκεν· δεύτερον αὖ θώρηκα περὶ στήθεσσιν ἔδυνε
a fine golden breast-plate, curiously wrought, which Pallas Athena the daughter of Zeus had given him when first he was about to set out upon his grievous labors. Over his shoulders the fierce warrior put the steel that saves men from doom, and across his breast	καλὸν χρύσειον πολυδαίδαλον, ὅν οἱ ἔδωκε Παλλὰς Ἀθηναίη, κούρη Διός, ὁππότʼ ἔμελλε τὸ πρῶτον στονόεντας ἐφορμήσεσθαι ἀέθλους. θήκατο δʼ ἀμφʼ ὤμοισιν ἀρῆς ἀλκτῆρα σίδηρον δεινὸς ἀνήρ· κοΐλην δὲ περὶ στήθεσσι φαρέτρην
he slung behind him a hollow quiver. Within it were many chilling arrows, dealers of death which makes speech forgotten: in front they had death, and trickled with tears; their shafts were smooth and very long; and their butts were covered with feathers of a brown eagle.	καββάλετʼ ἐξόπιθεν· πολλοὶ δʼ ἔντοσθεν ὀιστοὶ ῥιγηλοί, θανάτοιο λαθιφθόγγοιο δοτῆρες. πρόσθεν μὲν θάνατόν τʼ εἶχον καὶ δάκρυσι μῦρον, μέσσοι δὲ ξεστοί, περιμήκεες, αὐτὰρ ὄπισθε μόρφνοιο φλεγύαο καλυπτόμενοι πτερύγεσσιν.
And he took his strong spear, pointed with shining bronze, and on his valiant head set a well-made helm of adamant, cunningly wrought, which fitted closely on the temples; and that guarded the head of god-like Heracles. In his hands he took his shield, all glittering: no one ever	εἵλετο δʼ ὄβριμον ἔγχος, ἀκαχμένον αἴθοπι χαλκῷ, κρατὶ δʼ ἔπʼ ἰφθίμῳ κυνέην ἐύτυκτον ἔθηκε, δαιδαλέην ἀδάμαντος, ἐπὶ κροτάφοις ἀραρυῖαν, ἥτʼ εἴρυτο κάρη Ἡρακλῆος θείοιο. χερσί γε μὴν σάκος εἷλε παναίολον, οὐδέ τις αὐτὸ
broke it with a blow or crushed it. And a wonder it was to see; for its whole orb shimmered with enamel and white ivory and electrum, and it glowed with shining gold; and there were zones of cyanus drawn upon it. In the center was Fear worked in adamant, unspeakable,	οὔτʼ ἔρρηξε βαλὼν οὔτʼ ἔθλασε, θαῦμα ἰδέσθαι. πᾶν μὲν γὰρ κύκλῳ τιτάνῳ λευκῷ τʼ ἐλέφαντι ἠλέκτρῳ θʼ ὑπολαμπὲς ἔην χρυσῷ τε φαεινῷ λαμπόμενον, κυάνου δὲ διὰ πτύχες ἠλήλαντο. ἐν μέσσῳ δʼ ἀδάμαντος ἔην Φόβος οὔ τι φατειός,
staring backwards with eyes that glowed with fire. His mouth was full of teeth in a white row, fearful and daunting, and upon his grim brow hovered frightful Strife who arrays the throng of men: pitiless she, for she took away the mind and senses of poor wretches	ἔμπαλιν ὄσσοισιν πυρὶ λαμπομένοισι δεδορκώς· τοῦ καὶ ὀδόντων μὲν πλῆτο στόμα λευκὰ θεόντων, δεινῶν ἀπλήτων, ἐπὶ δὲ βλοσυροῖο μετώπου δεινὴ Ἔρις πεπότητο κορύσσουσα κλόνον ἀνδρῶν, σχετλίη, ἥ ῥα νόον τε καὶ ἐκ φρένας εἵλετο φωτῶν.
who made war against the son of Zeus. Their souls passed beneath the earth and went down into the house of Hades; but their bones, when the skin is rotted about them, crumble away on the dark earth under parching Sirius.	οἵτινες ἀντιβίην πόλεμον Διὸς υἷι φέροιεν. τῶν καὶ ψυχαὶ μὲν χθόνα δύμεναι Ἄιδος εἴσω κάκκιον, ὀστέα δέ σφι περὶ ῥινοῖο σαπείσης Σειρίου ἀζαλέοιο μελαίνῃ πύθεται αἴῃ.
Upon the shield Pursuit and Flight were wrought,	ἐν δὲ Προΐωξίς τε Παλίωξίς τε τέτυκτο,
and Tumult, and Panic, and Slaughter. Strife also, and Uproar were hurrying about, and deadly Fate was there holding one man newly wounded, and another unwounded; and one, who was dead, she was dragging by the feet through the tumult. She had on her shoulders a garment red with the blood of men,	ἐν δʼ Ὅμαδός τε Φόβος τʼ Ἀνδροκτασίη τε δεδήει, ἐν δʼ Ἔρις, ἐν δὲ Κυδοιμὸς ἐθύνεον, ἐν δʼ ὀλοὴ Κὴρ ἄλλον ζωὸν ἔχουσα νεούτατον, ἄλλον ἄουτον, ἄλλον τεθνηῶτα κατὰ μόθον ἕλκε ποδοῖιν. εἷμα δʼ ἔχʼ ἄμφʼ ὤμοισι δαφοινεὸν αἵματι φωτῶν,
and terribly she glared and gnashed her teeth. And there were heads of snakes unspeakably frightful, twelve of them; and they used to frighten the tribes of men on earth made war against the son of Zeus; for they would clash their teeth when Amphitryon's son was fighting:	δεινὸν δερκομένη καναχῇσί τε βεβρυχυῖα. ἐν δʼ ὀφίων κεφαλαὶ δεινῶν ἔσαν, οὔ τι φατειῶν, δώδεκα, ταὶ φοβέεσκον ἐπὶ χθονὶ φῦλʼ ἀνθρώπων, οἵ τινες ἀντιβίην πόλεμον Διὸς υἷι φέροιεν· τῶν καὶ ὀδόντων μὲν καναχὴ πέλεν, εὖτε μάχοιτο
and brightly shone these wonderful works. And it was as though there were spots upon the frightful snakes: and their backs were dark blue and their jaws were black. Also there were upon the shield droves of boars and lions who glared at each other, being furious and eager:	Ἀμφιτρυωνιάδης, τὰ δʼ ἐδαίετο θαυματὰ ἔργα. στίγματα δʼ ὣς ἐπέφαντο ἰδεῖν δεινοῖσι δράκουσιν· κυάνεοι κατὰ νῶτα, μελάνθησαν δὲ γένεια. ἐν δὲ συῶν ἀγέλαι χλούνων· ἔσαν ἠδὲ λεόντων ἐς σφέας δερκομένων, κοτεόντων θʼ ἱεμένων τε.
the rows of them moved on together, and neither side trembled but both bristled up their manes. For already a great lion lay between them and two boars, one on either side, bereft of life, and their dark blood was dripping down upon the ground;	τῶν καὶ ὁμιληδὸν στίχες ἤισαν· οὐδέ νυ τώ γε οὐδέτεροι τρεέτην· φρῖσσόν γε μὲν αὐχένας ἄμφω. ἤδη γάρ σφιν ἔκειτο μέγας λῖς, ἀμφὶ δὲ κάπροι δοιοί, ἀπουράμενοι ψυχάς, κατὰ δέ σφι κελαινὸν αἷμʼ ἀπελείβετʼ ἔραζʼ· οἳ δʼ αὐχένας ἐξεριπόντες
they lay dead with necks outstretched beneath the grim lions. And both sides were roused still more to fight because they were angry, the fierce boars and the bright-eyed lions.	κείατο τεθνηῶτες ὑπὸ βλοσυροῖσι λέουσιν. τοὶ δʼ ἔτι μᾶλλον ἐγειρέσθην κοτέοντε μάχεσθαι, ἀμφότεροι, χλοῦναί τε σύες χαροποί τε λέοντες.
And there was the strife of the Lapith spearmen gathered round the prince Caeneus and Dryas and Peirithous,	ἐν δʼ ἦν ὑσμίνη Λαπιθάων αἰχμητάων Καινέα τʼ ἀμφὶ ἄνακτα Δρύαντά τε Πειρίθοόν τε
with Hopleus, Exadius, Phalereus, and Prolochus, Mopsus the son of Ampyce of Titaresia, a scion of Ares, and Theseus, the son of Aegeus, like the deathless gods. These were of silver, and had armor of gold upon their bodies. And the Centaurs were gathered against them on the other side	Ὁπλέα τʼ Ἐξάδιόν τε Φάληρόν τε Πρόλοχόν τε Μόψον τʼ Ἀμπυκίδην, Τιταρήσιον, ὄζον Ἄρηος, Θησέα τʼ Αἰγεΐδην, ἐπιείκελον ἀθανάτοισιν· ἀργύρεοι, χρύσεια περὶ χροῒ τεύχεʼ ἔχοντες. Κένταυροι δʼ ἑτέρωθεν ἐναντίοι ἠγερέθοντο
with Petraeus and Asbolus the diviner, Arctus, and Ureus, and black-haired Mimas, and the two sons of Peuceus, Perimedes and Dryalus: these were of silver, and they had pinetrees of gold in their hands, and they were rushing together as though they were alive	ἀμφὶ μέγαν Πετραῖον ἰδʼ Ἄσβολον οἰωνιστὴν Ἄρκτον τʼ Οὔρειόν τε μελαγχαίτην τε Μίμαντα καὶ δύο Πευκεΐδας, Περιμήδεά τε Δρύαλόν τε, ἀργύρεοι, χρυσέας ἐλάτας ἐν χερσὶν ἔχοντες. καί τε συναΐγδην ὡς εἰ ζωοί περ ἐόντες
and striking at one another hand to hand with spears and with pines. And on the shield stood the fleet-footed horses of grim Ares made of gold, and deadly Ares the spoil-winner himself. He held a spear in his hands and was urging on the footmen: he was red with blood as if he were slaying living men,	ἔγχεσιν ἠδʼ ἐλάτῃς αὐτοσχεδὸν ὠριγνῶντο. ἐν δʼ Ἄρεος βλοσυροῖο ποδώκεες ἕστασαν ἵπποι χρύσεοι, ἐν δὲ καὶ αὐτὸς ἐναρσφόρος οὔλιος Ἄρης αἰχμὴν ἐν χείρεσσιν ἔχων, πρυλέεσσι κελεύων, αἵματι φοινικόεις, ὡς εἰ ζωοὺς ἐναρίζων
and he stood in his chariot. Beside him stood Fear and Flight, eager to plunge amidst the fighting men. There, too, was the daughter of Zeus, Tritogeneia who drives the spoil. She was like as if she would array a battle, with a spear in her hand, and a golden helmet,	δίφρου ἐπεμβεβαώς· παρὰ δὲ Δεῖμός τε Φόβος τε ἕστασαν ἱέμενοι πόλεμον καταδύμεναι ἀνδρῶν. ἐν δὲ Διὸς θυγάτηρ ἀγελείη Τριτογένεια, τῇ ἰκέλη ὡς εἴ τε μάχην ἐθέλουσα κορύσσειν, ἔγχος ἔχουσʼ ἐν χερσὶν ἰδὲ χρυσέην τρυφάλειαν
and the aegis about her shoulders. And she was going towards the awful strife. And there was the holy company of the deathless gods: and in the midst the son of Zeus and Leto played sweetly on a golden lyre. There also was the abode of the gods, pure Olympus , and their assembly, and infinite riches were spread around	αἰγίδα τʼ ἀμφʼ ὤμοις· ἐπὶ δʼ ᾤχετο φύλοπιν αἰνήν. ἐν δʼ ἦν ἀθανάτων ἱερὸς χορός· ἐν δʼ ἄρα μέσσῳ ἱμερόεν κιθάριζε Διὸς καὶ Λητοῦς υἱὸς χρυσείῃ φόρμιγγι·
in the gathering of the deathless gods. Also the goddesses, the Muses of Pieria were beginning a song like clear-voiced singers. And on the shield was a harbor with a safe haven from the irresistible sea, made of refined tin wrought in a circle, and it seemed to heave with waves. In the middle of it were	θεαὶ δʼ ἐξῆρχον ἀοιδῆς Μοῦσαι Πιερίδες, λιγὺ μελπομένῃς ἐικυῖαι. ἐν δὲ λιμὴν ἐύορμος ἀμαιμακέτοιο θαλάσσης κυκλοτερὴς ἐτέτυκτο πανέφθου κασσιτέροιο κλυζομένῳ ἴκελος·
many dolphins rushing this way and that, fishing: and they seemed to be swimming. Two dolphins of silver were spouting and devouring the mute fishes. And beneath them fishes of bronze were trembling. And on the shore sat a fisherman watching: in his hands he held	δοιὼ δʼ ἀναφυσιόωντες ἀργύρεοι δελφῖνες ἐθοινῶντʼ ἔλλοπας ἰχθῦς. τῶν δʼ ὕπο χάλκειοι τρέον ἰχθύες· αὐτὰρ ἐπʼ ἀκταῖς ἧστο ἀνὴρ ἁλιεὺς δεδοκημένος· εἶχε δὲ χερσὶν
a casting net for fish, and seemed as if about to cast it forth.	ἰχθύσιν ἀμφίβληστρον ἀπορρίψοντι ἐοικώς.
There, too, was the son of rich-haired Danae, the horseman Perseus: his feet did not touch the shield and yet were not far from it—very marvellous to remark, since he was not supported anywhere; for so did the famous Lame One fashion him of gold with his hands.	ἐν δʼ ἦν ἠυκόμου Δανάης τέκος, ἱππότα Περσεύς, οὔτʼ ἄρʼ ἐπιψαύων σάκεος ποσὶν οὔθʼ ἑκὰς αὐτοῦ, θαῦμα μέγα φράσσασθʼ, ἐπεὶ οὐδαμῇ ἐστήρικτο. τὼς γάρ μιν παλάμαις τεῦξεν κλυτὸς Ἀμφιγυήεις
On his feet he had winged sandals, and his black-sheathed sword was slung across his shoulders by a cross-belt of bronze. He was flying swift as thought. The head of a dreadful monster, the Gorgon, covered the broad of his back, and a bag of silver—a marvel to see—	χρύσεον· ἀμφὶ δὲ ποσσὶν ἔχεν πτερόεντα πέδιλα. ὤμοισιν δέ μιν ἀμφὶ μελάνδετον ἆορ ἔκειτο χαλκέου ἐκ τελαμῶνος· ὃ δʼ ὥς τε νόημʼ ἐποτᾶτο· πᾶν δὲ μετάφρενον εἶχε κάρη δεινοῖο πελώρου, Γοργοῦς· ἀμφὶ δέ μιν κίβισις θέε, θαῦμα ἰδέσθαι,
contained it: and from the bag bright tassels of gold hung down. Upon the head of the hero lay the dread cap of Hades which had the awful gloom of night. Perseus himself, the son of Danae, was at full stretch, like one who hurries and shudders with horror. And after him rushed	ἀργυρέη· θύσανοι δὲ κατῃωρεῦντο φαεινοὶ χρύσειοι· δεινὴ δὲ περὶ κροτάφοισιν ἄνακτος κεῖτʼ Ἄιδος κυνέη νυκτὸς ζόφον αἰνὸν ἔχουσα. αὐτὸς δὲ σπεύδοντι καὶ ἐρρίγοντι ἐοικὼς Περσεὺς Δαναΐδης ἐτιταίνετο. ταὶ δὲ μετʼ αὐτὸν
the Gorgons, unapproachable and unspeakable, longing to seize him: as they trod upon the pale adamant, the shield rang sharp and clear with a loud clanging. Two serpents hung down at their girdles with heads curved forward:	Γοργόνες ἄπλητοί τε καὶ οὐ φαταὶ ἐρρώοντο ἱέμεναι μαπέειν. ἐπὶ δὲ χλωροῦ ἀδάμαντος βαινουσέων ἰάχεσκε σάκος μεγάλῳ ὀρυμαγδῷ ὀξέα καὶ λιγέως· ἐπὶ δὲ ζώνῃσι δράκοντε δοιὼ ἀπῃωρεῦντʼ ἐπικυρτώοντε κάρηνα.
their tongues were flickering, and their teeth gnashing with fury, and their eyes glaring fiercely. And upon the awful heads of the Gorgons great Fear was quaking. And beyond these there were men fighting in warlike harness, some defending their own town and parents	λίχμαζον δʼ ἄρα τώ γε· μένει δʼ ἐχάρασσον ὀδόντας ἄγρια δερκομένω. ἐπὶ δὲ δεινοῖσι καρήνοις Γοργείοις ἐδονεῖτο μέγας Φόβος. οἳ δʼ ὑπὲρ αὐτέων ἄνδρες ἐμαρνάσθην πολεμήια τεύχεʼ ἔχοντες, τοὶ μὲν ὑπὲρ σφετέρης πόλιος σφετέρων τε τοκήων
from destruction, and others eager to sack it; many lay dead, but the greater number still strove and fought. The women on well-built towers of bronze were crying shrilly and tearing their cheeks like living beings—the work of famous Hephaestus.	λοιγὸν ἀμύνοντες, τοὶ δὲ πραθέειν μεμαῶτες. πολλοὶ μὲν κέατο, πλέονες δʼ ἔτι δῆριν ἔχοντες μάρνανθʼ· αἱ δὲ γυναῖκες ἐυδμήτων ἐπὶ πύργων χαλκέων ὀξὺ βόων, κατὰ δʼ ἐδρύπτοντο παρειάς, ζωῇσιν ἴκελαι, ἔργα κλυτοῦ Ἡφαίστοιο.
And the men who were elders and on whom age had laid hold were all together outside the gates, and were holding up their hands to the blessed gods, fearing for their own sons. But these again were engaged in battle: and behind them the dusky Fates, gnashing their white fangs,	ἄνδρες δʼ, οἳ πρεσβῆες ἔσαν γῆράς τε μέμαρπεν, ἀθρόοι ἔκτοσθεν πυλέων ἔσαν, ἂν δὲ θεοῖσι χεῖρας ἔχον μακάρεσσι, περὶ σφετέροισι τέκεσσι δειδιότες· τοὶ δʼ αὖτε μάχην ἔχον. αἳ δὲ μετʼ αὐτοὺς Κῆρες κυάνεαι, λευκοὺς ἀραβεῦσαι ὀδόντας,
lowering, grim, bloody, and unapproachable, struggled for those who were falling, for they all were longing to drink dark blood. So soon as they caught a man overthrown or falling newly wounded, one of them would clasp her great claws about him, and his soul would go down to Hades	δεινωπαὶ βλοσυραί τε δαφοιναί τʼ ἄπληταί τε δῆριν ἔχον περὶ πιπτόντων· πᾶσαι δʼ ἄρʼ ἵεντο αἷμα μέλαν πιέειν· ὃν δὲ πρῶτον μεμάποιεν κείμενον ἢ πίπτοντα νεούτατον, ἀμφὶ μὲν αὐτῷ βάλλʼ ὄνυχας μεγάλους, ψυχὴ δʼ Ἄιδόσδε κατῇεν
to chilly Tartarus. And when they had satisfied their souls with human blood, they would cast that one behind them, and rush back again into the tumult and the fray. Clotho and Lachesis were over them and Atropos less tall than they, a goddess of no great frame, yet	Τάρταρον ἐς κρυόενθʼ. αἳ δὲ φρένας εὖτʼ ἀρέσαντο αἵματος ἀνδρομέου, τὸν μὲν ῥίπτασκον ὀπίσσω, ἂψ δʼ ὅμαδον καὶ μῶλον ἐθύνεον αὖτις ἰοῦσαι. Κλωθὼ καὶ Λάχεσίς σφιν ἐφέστασαν· ἣ μὲν ὑφήσσων Ἀτροπος οὔ τι πέλεν μεγάλη θεός, ἀλλʼ ἄρα ἥ γε
superior to the others and the eldest of them. And they all made a fierce fight over one poor wretch, glaring evilly at one another with furious eyes and fighting equally with claws and hands. By them stood Darkness of Death, mournful and fearful,	τῶν γε μὲν ἀλλάων προφερής τʼ ἦν πρεσβυτάτη τε. πᾶσαι δʼ ἀμφʼ ἑνὶ φωτὶ μάχην δριμεῖαν ἔθεντο. δεινὰ δʼ ἐς ἀλλήλας δράκον ὄμμασι θυμήνασαι, ἐν δʼ ὄνυχας χεῖράς τε θρασείας ἰσώσαντο. πὰρ δʼ Ἀχλὺς εἱστήκει ἐπισμυγερή τε καὶ αἰνή,
pale, shrivelled, shrunk with hunger, swollen-kneed. Long nails tipped her hands, and she dribbled at the nose, and from her cheeks blood dripped down to the ground. She stood leering hideously, and much dust sodden with tears lay upon her shoulders.	χλωρὴ ἀυσταλέη λιμῷ καταπεπτηυῖα, γουνοπαχής, μακροὶ δʼ ὄνυχες χείρεσσιν ὑπῆσαν. τῆς ἐκ μὲν ῥινῶν μύξαι ῥέον, ἐκ δὲ παρειῶν αἷμʼ ἀπελείβετʼ ἔραζʼ· ἣ δʼ ἄπλητον σεσαρυῖα εἱστήκει, πολλὴ δὲ κόνις κατενήνοθεν ὤμους,
Next, there was a city of men with goodly towers; and seven gates of gold, fitted to the lintels, guarded it. The men were making merry with festivities and dances; some were bringing home a bride to her husband on a well-wheeled car, while the bridalsong swelled high,	δάκρυσι μυδαλέη. παρὰ δʼ εὔπυργος πόλις ἀνδρῶν· χρύσειαι δέ μιν εἶχον ὑπερθυρίοις ἀραρυῖαι ἑπτὰ πύλαι· τοὶ δʼ ἄνδρες ἐν ἀγλαΐῃς τε χοροῖς τε τέρψιν ἔχον· τοὶ μὲν γὰρ ἐυσσώτρου ἐπʼ ἀπήνης ἤγοντʼ ἀνδρὶ γυναῖκα, πολὺς δʼ ὑμέναιος ὀρώρει·
and the glow of blazing torches held by handmaidens rolled in waves afar. And these maidens went before, delighting in the festival; and after them came frolicsome choirs, the youths singing soft-mouthed to the sound of shrill pipes, while the echo was shivered around them,	τῆλε δʼ ἀπʼ αἰθομένων δαΐδων σέλας εἰλύφαζε χερσὶν ἔνι δμῳῶν· ταὶ δʼ ἀγλαΐῃ τεθαλυῖαι πρόσθʼ ἔκιον· τῇσιν δὲ χοροὶ παίζοντες ἕποντο. τοὶ μὲν ὑπὸ λιγυρῶν συρίγγων ἵεσαν αὐδὴν ἐξ ἁπαλῶν στομάτων, περὶ δέ σφισιν ἄγνυτο ἠχώ.
and the girls led on the lovely dance to the sound of lyres. Then again on the other side was a rout of young men revelling, with flutes playing; some frolicking with dance and song, and others were going forward in time with a flute player and laughing. The whole town was filled with mirth and dance and festivity.	αἳ δʼ ὑπὸ φορμίγγων ἄναγον χορὸν ἱμερόεντα. ἔνθεν δʼ αὖθʼ ἑτέρωθε νέοι κώμαζον ὑπʼ αὐλοῦ, τοί γε μὲν αὖ παίζοντες ὑπʼ ὀρχηθμῷ καὶ ἀοιδῇ τοί γε μὲν αὖ γελόωντες ὑπʼ αὐλητῆρι ἕκαστος πρόσθʼ ἔκιον· πᾶσαν δὲ πόλιν θαλίαι τε χοροί τε
Others again were mounted on horseback and galloping before the town. And there were ploughmen breaking up the good soil, clothed in tunics girt up. Also there was a wide cornland, and some men were reaping with sharp hooks the stalks	ἀγλαΐαι τʼ εἶχον. τοὶ δʼ αὖ προπάροιθε πόληος νῶθʼ ἵππων ἐπιβάντες ἐθύνεον. οἱ δʼ ἀροτῆρες ἤρεικον χθόνα δῖαν, ἐπιστολάδην δὲ χιτῶνας ἐστάλατʼ. αὐτὰρ ἔην βαθὺ λήιον· οἵ γε μὲν ἤμων αἰχμῇς ὀξείῃσι κορωνιόωντα πέτηλα,
which bended with the weight of the ears—as if they were reaping Demeter's grain: others were binding the sheaves with bands and were spreading the threshing floor. And some held reaping hooks and were gathering the vintage, while others were taking from the reapers into baskets white and black clusters from the long rows of vines	βριθόμενα σταχύων, ὡς εἰ Δημήτερος ἀκτήν· οἳ δʼ ἄρʼ ἐν ἐλλεδανοῖσι δέον καὶ ἔπιτνον ἀλωήν, οἳ δʼ ἐτρύγων οἴνας δρεπάνας ἐν χερσὶν ἔχοντες, οἳ δʼ αὖτʼ ἐς ταλάρους ἐφόρευν ὑπὸ τρυγητήρων λευκοὺς καὶ μέλανας βότρυας μεγάλων ἀπὸ ὄρχων,
which were heavy with leaves and tendrils of silver. Others again were gathering them into baskets. Beside them was a row of vines	βριθομένων φύλλοισι καὶ ἀργυρέῃς ἑλίκεσσιν. οἳ δʼ αὖτʼ ἐς ταλάρους ἐφόρευν. παρὰ δέ σφισιν ὄρχος
in gold, the splendid work of cunning Hephaestus:	χρύσεος ἦν, κλυτὰ ἔργα περίφρονος Ἡφαίστοιο,
it had shivering leaves and stakes of silver	σειόμενος φύλλοισι καὶ ἀργυρέῃσι κάμαξι,
and was laden with grapes which turned black. And there were men treading out the grapes and others drawing off the liquor. Also there were men boxing and wrestling, and huntsmen chasing swift hares with a leash of sharp-toothed dogs before them, they eager to catch the hares, and the hares eager to escape.	βριθόμενος σταφυλῇσι· μελάνθησάν γε μὲν αἵδε. οἵ γε μὲν ἐτράπεον, τοὶ δʼ ἤρυον· οἳ δʼ ἐμάχοντο πύξ τε καὶ ἑλκηδόν· τοὶ δʼ ὠκύποδας λαγὸς ᾕρευν ἄνδρες θηρευταί, καὶ καρχαρόδοντε κύνε πρό, ἱέμενοι μαπέειν, οἳ δʼ ἱέμενοι ὑπαλύξαι.
Next to them were horsemen hard set, and they contended and labored for a prize. The charioteers standing on their well-woven cars, urged on their swift horses with loose rein; the jointed cars flew along clattering and the naves of the wheels shrieked loudly.	πὰρ δʼ αὐτοῖς ἱππῆες ἔχον πόνον, ἀμφὶ δʼ ἀέθλῳ δῆριν ἔχον καὶ μόχθον. ἐυπλεκέων δʼ ἐπὶ δίφρων ἡνίοχοι βεβαῶτες ἐφίεσαν ὠκέας ἵππους ῥυτὰ χαλαίνοντες, τὰ δʼ ἐπικροτέοντα πέτοντο ἅρματα κολλήεντʼ, ἐπὶ δὲ πλῆμναι μέγʼ ἀύτευν.
So they were engaged in an unending toil, and the end with victory came never to them, and the contest was ever unwon. And there was set out for them within the course a great tripod of gold, the splendid work of cunning Hephaestus. And round the rim Ocean was flowing, with a full stream as it seemed,	οἳ μὲν ἄρʼ ἀίδιον εἶχον πόνον οὐδέ ποτέ σφιν νίκη ἐπηνύσθη, ἀλλʼ ἄκριτον εἶχον ἄεθλον. τοῖσιν δὲ προέκειτο μέγας τρίπος ἐντὸς ἀγῶνος, χρύσειος, κλυτὰ ἔργα περίφρονος Ἡφαίστοιο. ἀμφὶ δʼ ἴτυν ῥέεν Ὠκεανὸς πλήθοντι ἐοικώς,
and enclosed all the cunning work of the shield. Over it swans were soaring and calling loudly, and many others were swimming upon the surface of the water; and near them were shoals of fish. A wonderful thing the great strong shield was to see—even for Zeus the loud-thunderer, by whose will Hephaestus made it	πᾶν δὲ συνεῖχε σάκος πολυδαίδαλον, οἳ δὲ κατʼ αὐτὸν κύκνοι ἀερσιπόται μεγάλʼ ἤπυον, οἵ ῥά τε πολλοὶ νῆχον ἐπʼ ἄκρον ὕδωρ· παρὰ δʼ ἰχθύες ἐκλονέοντο. θαῦμα ἰδεῖν καὶ Ζηνὶ βαρυκτύπῳ, οὗ διὰ βουλὰς Ἥφαιστος ποίησε σάκος μέγα τε στιβαρόν τε,
and fitted it with his hands. This shield the valiant son of Zeus wielded masterly, and leaped upon his horse-chariot like the lightning of his father Zeus who holds the aegis, moving lithely. And his charioteer, strong Iolaus, standing upon the car, guided the curved chariot.	ἀρσάμενος παλάμῃσι. τὸ μὲν Διὸς ἄλκιμος υἱὸς πάλλεν ἐπικρατέως· ἐπὶ δʼ ἱππείου θόρε δίφρου, εἴκελος ἀστεροπῇ πατρὸς Διὸς αἰγιόχοιο, κοῦφα βιβάς· τῷ δʼ ἡνίοχος κρατερὸς Ἰόλαος δίφρου ἐπεμβεβαὼς ἰθύνετο καμπύλον ἅρμα.
Then the goddess grey-eyed Athena came near them and spoke winged words, encouraging them:	ἀγχίμολον δέ σφʼ ἦλθε θεὰ γλαυκῶπις Ἀθήνη, καί σφεας θαρσύνουσα ἔπεα πτερόεντα προσηύδα·
“Hail, offspring of far-famed Lynceus! Even now Zeus who reigns over the blessed gods gives you power to slay Cycnus and to strip off his splendid armor.	χαίρετε, Λυγκῆος γενεὴ τηλεκλειτοῖο· νῦν δὴ Ζεὺς κράτος ὔμμι διδοῖ μακάρεσσιν ἀνάσσων Κύκνον τʼ ἐξεναρεῖν καὶ ἀπὸ κλυτὰ τεύχεα δῦσαι.
Yet I will tell you something besides, mightiest of the people. When you have robbed Cycnus of sweet life, then leave him there and his armor also, and you yourself watch man-slaying Ares narrowly as he attacks, and wherever you shall see him uncovered below his cunningly-wrought shield,	ἄλλο δὲ τοί τι ἔπος ἐρέω, μέγα φέρτατε λαῶν· εὖτʼ ἂν δὴ Κύκνον γλυκερῆς αἰῶνος ἀμέρσῃς, τὸν μὲν ἔπειτʼ αὐτοῦ λιπέειν καὶ τεύχεα τοῖο, αὐτὸς δὲ βροτολοιγὸν Ἄρην ἐπιόντα δοκεύσας, ἔνθα κε γυμνωθέντα σάκευς ὕπο δαιδαλέοιο
there wound him with your sharp spear. Then draw back; for it is not ordained that you should take his horses or his splendid armor.” So said the bright-eyed goddess and swiftly got up into the car with victory and renown in her hands.	ὀφθαλμοῖσιν ἴδῃς, ἔνθʼ οὐτάμεν ὀξέι χαλκῷ· ἂψ δʼ ἀναχάσσασθαι· ἐπεὶ οὔ νύ τοι αἴσιμόν ἐστιν οὔθʼ ἵππους ἑλέειν οὔτε κλυτὰ τεύχεα τοῖο. ὣς εἰποῦσʼ ἐς δίφρον ἐβήσατο δῖα θεάων, νίκην ἀθανάτῃς χερσὶν καὶ κῦδος ἔχουσα,
Then heaven-nurtured Iolaus called terribly to the horses, and at his cry they swiftly whirled the fleet chariot along, raising dust from the plain; for the goddess bright-eyed Athena put mettle into them by shaking her aegis. And the earth groaned all round them.	ἐσσυμένως. τότε δή ῥα διόγνητος Ἰόλαος σμερδαλέον ἵπποισιν ἐκέκλετο· τοὶ δʼ ὑπʼ ὀμοκλῆς ῥίμφʼ ἔφερον θοὸν ἅρμα κονίοντες πεδίοιο. ἐν γάρ σφιν μένος ἧκε θεὰ γλαυκῶπις Ἀθήνη αἰγίδʼ ἀνασσείσασα· περιστονάχησε δὲ γαῖα.
And they, horse-taming Cycnus and Ares, insatiable in war, came on together like fire or whirlwind. Then their horses neighed shrilly, face to face; and the echo was shivered all round them. And mighty Heracles spoke first and said to that other:	τοὶ δʼ ἄμυδις προγένοντʼ ἴκελοι πυρὶ ἠὲ θυέλλῃ, Κύκνος θʼ ἱππόδαμος καὶ Ἄρης ἀκόρητος ἀυτῆς. τῶν ἵπποι μὲν ἔπειθʼ ὑπεναντίοι ἀλλήλοισιν ὀξεῖα χρέμισαν, περὶ δέ σφισιν ἄγνυτο ἠχώ. τὸν πρότερος προσέειπε βίη Ἡρακληείη·
“Cycnus, my friend! Why do you set your swift horses at us, men who are tried in labor and pain? No, guide your fleet car aside and yield and go out of the path. It is to Trachis I am driving on, to Ceyx the king, who is the first in Trachis for power and for honor,	κύκνε πέπον, τί νυ νῶιν ἐπίσχετον ὠκέας ἵππους ἀνδράσιν, οἵ τε πόνου καὶ ὀιζύος ἴδριές εἰμεν; ἀλλὰ παρὲξ ἔχε δίφρον ἐύξοον ἠδὲ κελεύθου εἶκε παρὲξ ἰέναι. Τρηχῖνα δέ τοι παρελαύνω ἐς Κήυκα ἄνακτα· ὃ γὰρ δυνάμι τε καὶ αἰδοῖ
and that you yourself know well, for you have his daughter dark-eyed Themistinoe to wife. Fool! For Ares shall not deliver you from the end of death, if we two meet together in battle. Another time ere this I declare he has made trial	Τρηχῖνος προβέβηκε, σὺ δʼ εὖ μάλα οἶσθα καὶ αὐτός· τοῦ γὰρ ὀπυίεις παῖδα Θεμιστονόην κυανῶπιν. ὦ πέπον, οὐ μὲν γὰρ τοι Ἄρης θανάτοιο τελευτὴν ἀρκέσει, εἰ δὴ νῶι συνοισόμεθα πτολεμίζειν. ἤδη μέν τέ ἕ φημι καὶ ἄλλοτε πειρηθῆναι
of my spear, when he defended sandy Pylos and stood against me, fiercely longing for fight. Thrice was he stricken by my spear and dashed to earth, and his shield was pierced; but the fourth time I struck his thigh, laying on with all my strength, and tore deep into his flesh.	ἔγχεος ἡμετέρου, ὅθʼ ὑπὲρ Πύλου ἠμαθόεντος ἀντίος ἔστη ἐμεῖο, μάχης ἄμοτον μενεαίνων. τρὶς μὲν ἐμῷ ὑπὸ δουρὶ τυπεὶς ἠρείσατο γαίῃ οὐταμένου σάκεος, τὸ δὲ τέτρατον ἤλασα μηρὸν παντὶ μένει σπεύδων, διὰ δὲ μέγα σαρκὸς ἄραξα.
And he fell headlong in the dust upon the ground through the force of my spear-thrust; then truly he would have been disgraced among the deathless gods, if by my hands he had left behind his bloody spoils.” So said he. But Cycnus the stout spearman cared not to obey him and to pull up the horses that drew his chariot.	πρηνὴς δʼ ἐν κονίῃσι χαμαὶ πέσεν ἔγχεος ὁρμῇ. ἔνθα κε δὴ λωβητὸς ἐν ἀθανάτοισιν ἐτύχθη χερσὶν ὕφʼ ἡμετέρῃσι λιπὼν ἔναρα βροτόεντα. ὣς ἔφατʼ· οὐδʼ ἄρα Κύκνος ἐυμμελίης ἐμενοίνα τῷ ἐπιπειθόμενος ἐχέμεν ἐρυσάρματας ἵππους.
Then it was that from their well-woven chariots they both leaped straight to the ground, the son of Zeus and the son of the Lord of War. The charioteers drove near by their horses with beautiful manes, and the wide earth rang with the beat of their hoofs as they rushed along. As when rocks leap forth from the high peak of a great mountain,	δὴ τότʼ ἀπʼ εὐπλεκέων δίφρων θόρον αἶψʼ ἐπὶ γαῖαν παῖς τε Διὸς μεγάλου καὶ Ἐνυαλίοιο ἄνακτος. ἡνίοχοι δʼ ἔμπλην ἔλασαν καλλίτριχας ἵππους· τῶν δʼ ὕπο σευομένων κανάχιζε πόσʼ εὐρεῖα χθών. ὡς δʼ ὅτʼ ἀφʼ ὑψηλῆς κορυφῆς ὄρεος μεγάλοιο
and fall on one another, and many towering oaks and pines and long-rooted poplars are broken by them as they whirl swiftly down until they reach the plain; so did they fall on one another with a great shout:	πέτραι ἀποθρῴσκωσιν, ἐπʼ ἀλλήλῃς δὲ πέσωσι, πολλαὶ δὲ δρῦς ὑψίκομοι, πολλαὶ δὲ τε πεῦκαι αἴγειροί τε τανύρριζοι ῥήγνυνται ὑπʼ αὐτέων ῥίμφα κυλινδομένων, εἵως πεδίονδʼ ἀφίκωνται, ὣς οἳ ἐπʼ ἀλλήλοισι πέσον μέγα κεκλήγοντες.
and all the town of the Myrmidons, and famous Iolcus, and Arne , and Helice, and grassy Anthea echoed loudly at the voice of the two. With an awful cry they closed: and wise Zeus thundered loudly and rained down drops of blood,	πᾶσα δὲ Μυρμιδόνων τε πόλις κλειτή τʼ Ἰαωλκὸς Ἄρνη τʼ ἠδʼ Ἑλίκη Ἄνθειά τε ποιήεσσα φωνῇ ὕπʼ ἀμφοτέρων μεγάλʼ ἴαχον· οἳ δʼ ἀλαλητῷ θεσπεσίῳ σύνισαν· μέγα δʼ ἔκτυπε μητίετα Ζεύς. κὰδ δʼ ἄρʼ ἀπʼ οὐρανόθεν ψιάδας βάλεν αἱματοέσσας,
giving the signal for battle to his dauntless son. As a tusked boar, fearful for a man to see before him in the glens of a mountain, resolves to fight with the huntsmen and whets his white tusks, turning sideways, while foam flows all round his mouth	σῆμα τιθεὶς πολέμοιο ἑῷ μεγαθαρσέι παιδί. οἷος δʼ ἐν βήσσῃς ὄρεος χαλεπὸς προϊδέσθαι κάπρος χαυλιόδων φρονέει θυμῷ μαχέσασθαι ἀνδράσι θηρευτῇς, θήγει δέ τε λευκὸν ὀδόντα δοχμωθείς, ἀφρὸς δὲ περὶ στόμα μαστιχόωντι
as he gnashes, and his eyes are like glowing fire, and he bristles the hair on his mane and around his neck—, like him the son of Zeus leaped from his horse chariot. And when the dark-winged whirring grasshopper, perched on a green shoot, begins to sing of summer to men—	λείβεται, ὄσσε δέ οἱ πυρὶ λαμπετόωντι ἔικτον, ὀρθὰς δʼ ἐν λοφιῇ φρίσσει τρίχας ἀμφί τε δειρήν· τῷ ἴκελος Διὸς υἱὸς ἀφʼ ἱππείου θόρε δίφρου. ἦμος δὲ χλοερῷ κυανόπτερος ἠχέτα τέττιξ ὄζῳ ἐφεζόμενος θέρος ἀνθρώποισιν ἀείδειν
his food and drink is the dainty dew—and all day long from dawn pours forth his voice in the deadliest heat, when Sirius scorches the flesh (then the beard grows upon the millet which men sow in summer), when the crude grapes	ἄρχεται, ᾧ τε πόσις καὶ βρῶσις θῆλυς ἐέρση, καί τε πανημέριός τε καὶ ἠώιος χέει αὐδὴν ἴδει ἐν αἰνοτάτῳ, ὅτε τε χρόα Σείριος ἄζει, τῆμος δὴ κέγχροισι πέρι γλῶχες τελέθουσι τούς τε θέρει σπείρουσιν, ὅτʼ ὄμφακες αἰόλλονται,
which Dionysus gave to men— a joy and a sorrow both—begin to color, in that season they fought and loud rose the clamor.	οἷα Διώνυσος δῶκʼ ἀνδράσι χάρμα καὶ ἄχθος· τὴν ὥρην μάρναντο, πολὺς δʼ ὀρυμαγδὸς ὀρώρει.
As two lions on either side of a slain deer spring at one another in fury, and there is a fearful snarling and a clashing also of teeth—,	ὡς δὲ λέοντε δύω ἀμφὶ κταμένης ἐλάφοιο ἀλλήλοις κοτέοντες ἐπὶ σφέας ὁρμήσωσι, δεινὴ δέ σφʼ ἰαχὴ ἄραβός θʼ ἅμα γίγνετʼ ὀδόντων·
like vultures with crooked talons and hooked beak that fight and scream aloud on a high rock over a mountain goat or fat wild-deer which some active man has shot with an arrow from the string, and himself has wandered away elsewhere,	οἳ δʼ ὥς τʼ αἰγυπιοὶ γαμψώνυχες, ἀγκυλοχεῖλαι, πέτρῃ ἔφʼ ὑψηλῇ μεγάλα κλάζοντε μάχονται αἰγὸς ὀρεσσινόμου ἢ ἀγροτέρης ἐλάφοιο πίονος, ἥν τʼ ἐδάμασσε βαλὼν αἰζήιος ἀνὴρ ἰῷ ἀπὸ νευρῆς, αὐτὸς δʼ ἀπαλήσεται ἄλλῃ
not knowing the place; but they quickly mark it and vehemently do keen battle about it—, like these they two rushed upon one another with a shout. Then Cycnus, eager to kill the son of almighty Zeus, struck upon his shield with a brazen spear,	χώρου ἄιδρις ἐών· οἳ δʼ ὀτραλέως ἐνόησαν, ἐσσυμένως δέ οἱ ἀμφὶ μάχην δριμεῖαν ἔθεντο· ὣς οἳ κεκλήγοντες ἐπʼ ἀλλήλοισιν ὄρουσαν. ἔνθʼ ἦ τοι Κύκνος μὲν ὑπερμενέος Διὸς υἱὸν κτεινέμεναι μεμαὼς σάκει ἔμβαλε χάλκεον ἔγχος,
but did not break the bronze; and the gift of the god saved his foe. But the son of Amphitryon, mighty Heracles, with his long spear struck Cycnus violently in the neck beneath the chin, where it was unguarded between helm and shield. And the deadly spear cut through the two sinews;	οὐδʼ ἔρρηξεν χαλκόν· ἔρυτο δὲ δῶρα θεοῖο. Ἀμφιτρυωνιάδης δέ, βίη Ἡρακληείη, μεσσηγὺς κόρυθός τε καὶ ἀσπίδος ἔγχεϊ μακρῷ αὐχένα γυμνωθέντα θοῶς ὑπένερθε γενείου ἤλασʼ ἐπικρατέως· ἀπὸ δʼ ἄμφω κέρσε τένοντε
for the hero's full strength lighted on his foe. And Cycnus fell as an oak falls or a lofty pine that is stricken by the lurid thunderbolt of Zeus; even so he fell, and his armour adorned with bronze clashed about him. Then the stout-hearted son of Zeus let him be,	ἀνδροφόνος μελίη· μέγα γὰρ σθένος ἔμπεσε φωτός. ἤριπε δʼ, ὡς ὅτε τις δρῦς ἤριπεν ἢ ὅτε πεύκη ἠλίβατος, πληγεῖσα Διὸς ψολόεντι κεραυνῷ· ὣς ἔριπʼ· ἀμφὶ δέ οἱ βράχε τεύχεα ποικίλα χαλκῷ. τὸν μὲν ἔπειτʼ εἴασε Διὸς ταλακάρδιος υἱός,
and himself watched for the onset of manslaying Ares: fiercely he stared, like a lion who has come upon a body and full eagerly rips the hide with his strong claws and takes away the sweet life with all speed: his dark heart is filled with rage	αὐτὸς δὲ βροτολοιγὸν Ἄρην προσιόντα δοκεύσας, δεινὸν ὁρῶν ὄσσοισι, λέων ὣς σώματι κύρσας, ὅς τε μάλʼ ἐνδυκέως ῥινὸν κρατεροῖς ὀνύχεσσι σχίσσας ὅττι τάχιστα μελίφρονα θυμὸν ἀπηύρα· ἐμ μένεος δʼ ἄρα τοῦ γε κελαινὸν πίμπλαται ἦτορ·
and his eyes glare fiercely, while he tears up the earth with his paws and lashes his flanks and shoulders with his tail so that no one dares to face him and go near to give battle. Even so, the son of Amphitryon, unsated of battle, stood eagerly face to face with Ares,	γλαυκιόων δʼ ὄσσοις δεινὸν πλευράς τε καὶ ὤμους οὐρῇ μαστιόων ποσσὶν γλάφει, οὐδέ τις αὐτὸν ἔτλη ἐς ἄντα ἰδὼν σχεδὸν ἐλθέμεν οὐδὲ μάχεσθαι· τοῖος ἄρʼ Ἀμφιτρυωνιάδης, ἀκόρητος ἀυτῆς, ἀντίος ἔστη Ἄρηος, ἐνὶ φρεσὶ θάρσος ἀέξων,
nursing courage in his heart. And Ares drew near him with grief in his heart; and they both sprang at one another with a cry. As it is when a rock shoots out from a great cliff and whirls down with long bounds, careering eagerly with a roar, and a high crag clashes with it and keeps it there where they strike together;	ἐσσυμένως· ὃ δέ οἱ σχεδὸν ἤλυθεν ἀχνύμενος κῆρ· ἀμφότεροι δʼ ἰάχοντες ἐπʼ ἀλλήλοισιν ὄρουσαν. ὡς δʼ ὅτʼ ἀπὸ μεγάλου πέτρη πρηῶνος ὀρούσῃ, μακρὰ δʼ ἐπιθρῴσκουσα κυλίνδεται, ἣ δέ τε ἠχῇ ἔρχεται ἐμμεμαυῖα, πάγος δέ οἱ ἀντεβόλησεν
with no less clamor did deadly Ares, the chariot-borne, rush shouting at Heracles. And he quickly received the attack.	ὑψηλός· τῷ δὴ συνενείκεται, ἔνθα μιν ἴσχει· τόσσῃ ὃ μὲν ἰαχῇ βρισάρματος οὔλιος Ἄρης κεκληγὼς ἐπόρουσεν· ὃ δʼ ἐμμαπέως ὑπέδεκτο.
But Athena the daughter of aegis-bearing Zeus came to meet Ares, wearing the dark aegis,	αὐτὰρ Ἀθηναίη, κούρη Διὸς αἰγιόχοιο, ἀντίη ἦλθεν Ἄρηος ἐρεμνὴν αἰγίδʼ ἔχουσα·
and she looked at him with an angry frown and spoke winged words to him. “Ares, check your fierce anger and matchless hands; for it is not ordained that you should kill Heracles, the bold-hearted son of Zeus, and strip off his rich armor. Come, then, cease fighting and do not withstand me.”	δεινὰ δʼ ὑπόδρα ἰδοῦσα ἔπεα πτερόεντα προσηύδα· Ἆρες, ἔπισχε μένος κρατερὸν καὶ χεῖρας ἀάπτους· οὐ γάρ τοι θέμις ἐστὶν ἀπὸ κλυτὰ τεύχεα δῦσαι Ἡρακλέα κτείναντα, Διὸς θρασυκάρδιον υἱόν· ἀλλʼ ἄγε παῦε μάχην, μηδʼ ἀντίος ἵστασʼ ἐμεῖο.
So said she, but did not move the courageous spirit of Ares. But he uttered a great shout and waving his spears like fire, he rushed headlong at strong Heracles, longing to kill him, and hurled a brazen spear upon the great shield, for he was furiously angry because of his dead son;	ὣς ἔφατʼ· ἀλλʼ οὐ πεῖθʼ Ἄρεος μεγαλήτορα θυμόν, ἀλλὰ μέγα ἰάχων φλογὶ εἴκελά τʼ ἔγχεα πάλλων καρπαλίμως ἐπόρουσε βίῃ Ἡρακληείῃ κακτάμεναι μεμαώς· καί ῥʼ ἔμβαλε χάλκεον ἔγχος, σπερχνὸν παιδὸς ἑοῦ κοτέων πέρι τεθνηῶτος,
but bright-eyed Athena reached out from the chariot and turned aside the force of the spear. Then bitter grief seized Ares, and he drew his keen sword and leaped upon bold-hearted Heracles. But as he came on, the son of Amphitryon, unsated of fierce battle,	ἐν σάκεϊ μεγάλῳ. ἀπὸ δὲ γλαυκῶπις Ἀθήνη ἔγχεος ὁρμὴν ἔτραπʼ ὀρεξαμένη ἀπὸ δίφρου. δριμὺ δʼ Ἄρην ἄχος εἷλε· ἐρυσσάμενος δʼ ἄορ ὀξὺ ἔσσυτʼ ἐφʼ Ἡρακλέα κρατερόφρονα· τὸν δʼ ἐπιόντα Ἀμφιτρυωνιάδης, δεινῆς ἀκόρητος ἀυτῆς,
shrewdly wounded his thigh where it was exposed under his richly-wrought shield, and tore deep into his flesh with the spear thrust and cast him flat upon the ground. And Panic and Dread quickly drove his smooth-wheeled chariot and horses near him and lifted him from the wide-pathed earth	μηρὸν γυμνωθέντα σάκευς ὕπο δαιδαλέοιο οὔτασʼ ἐπικρατέως· διὰ δὲ μέγα σαρκὸς ἄραξε δούρατι νωμήσας, ἐπὶ δὲ χθονὶ κάββαλε μέσσῃ. τῷ δὲ Φόβος καὶ Δεῖμος ἐύτροχον ἅρμα καὶ ἵππους ἤλασαν αἶψʼ ἐγγύς, καὶ ἀπὸ χθονὸς εὐρυοδείης
into his richly-wrought car, and then straight lashed the horses and came to high Olympus . But the son of Alcmena and glorious Iolaus stripped the fine armour off Cycnus' shoulders and went,	ἐς δίφρον θῆκαν πολυδαίδαλον· αἶψα δʼ ἔπειτα ἵππους μαστιέτην· ἵκοντο δὲ μακρὸν Ὄλυμπον. υἱὸς δʼ Ἀλκμήνης καὶ κυδάλιμος Ἰόλαος Κύκνον σκυλεύσαντες ἀπʼ ὤμων τεύχεα καλὰ νίσσοντʼ· αἶψα δʼ ἔπειτα πόλιν Τρηχῖνος ἵκοντο
and their swift horses carried them straight to the city of Trachis . And bright-eyed Athena went from there to great Olympus and her father's house. As for Cycnus, Ceyx buried him and the countless people who lived near the city of the glorious king, in Anthe and the city of the Myrmidons, and famous Iolcus,	ἵπποις ὠκυπόδεσσιν. ἀτὰρ γλαυκῶπις Ἀθήνη ἐξίκετʼ Οὔλυμπόν τε μέγαν καὶ δώματα πατρός. κύκνον δʼ αὖ Κῆυξ θάπτεν καὶ λαὸς ἀπείρων, οἵ ῥʼ ἐγγὺς ναῖον πόλιας κλειτοῦ βασιλῆος Ἄνθην Μυρμιδόνων τε πόλιν κλειτήν τʼ Ἰαωλκὸν
and Arne, and Helice: and many people were gathered doing honor to Ceyx, the friend of the blessed gods. But Anaurus, swelled by a rain-storm, blotted out the grave and memorial of Cycnus; for so Apollo, Leto's son, commanded him, because he used to watch for and violently despoil the rich hecatombs	Ἄρνην τʼ ἠδʼ Ἑλίκην· πολλὸς δʼ ἠγείρετο λαός, τιμῶντες Κήυκα, φίλον μακάρεσσι θεοῖσιν. τοῦ δὲ τάφον καὶ σῆμʼ ἀιδὲς ποίησεν Ἄναυρος ὄμβρῳ χειμερίῳ πλήθων· τὼς γάρ μιν Ἀπόλλων Λητοΐδης ἤνωξʼ, ὅτι ῥα κλειτὰς ἑκατόμβας
that any might bring to Phyto.	ὅστις ἄγοι Πυθοῖδε βίῃ σύλασκε δοκεύων.
My mother, Thebe of the golden shield, I shall place your interests above my lack of leisure. May rocky Delos , in whose praises I have poured myself out, not be indignant at me.	μᾶτερ ἐμά, τὸ τεόν, χρύσασπι Θήβα, πρᾶγμα καὶ ἀσχολίας ὑπέρτερον θήσομαι. μή μοι κραναὰ νεμεσάσαι Δᾶλος, ἐν ᾇ κέχυμαι.
What is dearer to good men than their noble parents? Yield, island of Apollo; indeed, with the help of the gods I shall accomplish the end of both graceful songs,	τί φίλτερον κεδνῶν τοκέων ἀγαθοῖς;
Since the Isthmus gave to the people of Cadmus six garlands from her games, the glory of triumph for my fatherland, where Alcmena bore her fearless	καὶ τὸν ἀκειρεκόμαν Φοῖβον χορεύων ἐν Κέῳ ἀμφιρύτᾳ σὺν ποντίοις ἀνδράσιν, καὶ τὰν ἁλιερκέα, Ἰσθμοῦ
son, before whom the bold hounds of Geryon once trembled. But I, while I frame for Herodotus a prize of honor for his four-horse chariot,	ἓξ ὤπασεν Κάδμου στρατῷ ἐξ ἀέθλων, καλλίνικον πατρίδι κῦδος. ἐν ᾇ καὶ τὸν ἀδείμαντον Ἀλκμήνα τέκεν
And in the games they attempted the greatest number of contests, and adorned their homes with tripods	ἁνία τʼ ἀλλοτρίαις οὐ χερσὶ νωμάσαντʼ ἐθέλω ἢ Καστορείῳ ἢ Ἰολάου ἐναρμόξαι νιν ὕμνῳ.
and caldrons and goblets of gold, tasting victorious garlands. Their excellence shines clearly, in the naked footraces and in the shield-clashing hoplite races,	κεῖνοι γὰρ ἡρώων διφρηλάται Λακεδαίμονι καὶ Θήβαις ἐτέκνωθεν κράτιστοι·
and in all the deeds of their hands, in flinging the spear	ἔν τʼ ἀέθλοισι θίγον πλείστων ἀγώνων,
and whenever they hurled the stone discus. For there was no pentathlon, but for each feat a separate prize was set up. Often crowning their hair with wreaths from these contests they appeared beside the streams of Dirce or near the Eurotas,	καὶ τριπόδεσσιν ἐκόσμησαν δόμον
the son of Iphicles, who was of the same city as the race of the Sown Men, and the son of Tyndareus, dwelling among the Achaeans in his highland home of Therapne. Farewell. But I, arraying with song Poseidon and the sacred Isthmus and the shores of Onchestus, shall tell, along with the honors of this man, the very famous fortune of his father Asopodorus	γευόμενοι στεφάνων
and of his ancestral land of Orchomenus, which received him from the boundless sea when he was hard-pressed by shipwreck, in chilly misfortune. But now once more his hereditary fortune has embarked him on	ἔν τε γυμνοῖσι σταδίοις σφίσιν ἔν τʼ ἀσπιδοδούποισιν ὁπλίταις δρόμοις,
If a man has devoted his whole spirit to excellence, sparing neither expense nor toils, it is right to grant the boast of manliness to those who achieve excellence, with an ungrudging	καὶ λιθίνοις ὁπότʼ ἐν δίσκοις ἵεν.
mind. For it is an easy gift for a skilled man to speak words of praise in recompense for labors of all kinds and thus to promote the common good.	οὐ γὰρ ἦν πεντάθλιον, ἀλλʼ ἐφʼ ἑκάστῳ
Different wages for different deeds are sweet to men, to the shepherd and the ploughman and the bird-trapper, and the man whom the sea nourishes. Every man is intent upon keeping persistent famine from his belly.	τῶν ἀθρόοις ἀνδησάμενοι θαμάκις ἔρνεσιν χαίτας ῥεέθροισί τε Δίρκας ἔφανεν καὶ παρʼ Εὐρώτᾳ πέλας,
For us it is right to celebrate the earth-shaking son of Cronus, returning a good deed to our beneficent neighbor, the lord of horse-racing and chariots;	Τυνδαρίδας δʼ ἐν Ἀχαιοῖς ὑψίπεδον Θεράπνας οἰκ έω ν ἕδος. χαίρετʼ. ἐγὼ δὲ Ποσειδάωνι Ἰσθμῷ τε ζαθέᾳ
and to invoke your sons, Amphitryon, and the secluded valley of Minyas, and Eleusis , the famous precinct of Demeter, and Euboea , when we speak of curving race-courses.	Ὀγχηστίαισίν τʼ ἀϊόνεσσιν περιστέλλων ἀοιδὰν
But the brief limits of my song prevent me from telling of all the victories that Hermes, lord of games, granted to Herodotus and his horses. Truly, often that which is hushed in silence actually brings greater pleasure.	Ὀρχομενοῖό τε πατρῴαν ἄρουραν, ἅ νιν ἐρειδόμενον ναυαγίαις
May he, raised up on the splendid wings of the Pierian Muses with their lovely voices,	δέξατο συντυχίᾳ· νῦν δʼ αὖτις ἀρχαίας ἐπέβασε πότμος
also arm his hand with wreaths from Pytho , with exquisite wreaths from the Alpheus and the Olympian games, thus winning glory for seven-gated Thebes. But if someone hoards hidden wealth at home, and attacks others with mockery, he fails to consider that he is giving up his soul to Hades without glory.	συγγενὴς εὐαμερίας. ὁ πονήσαις δὲ νόῳ καὶ προμάθειαν φέρει·
The men of old, Thrasybulus, who mounted the chariot of the Muses with their golden headbands, joining the glorious lyre, lightly shot forth their honey-voiced songs for young men, if one was handsome and had the sweetest ripeness that brings to mind Aphrodite on her lovely throne.	εἰ δʼ ἀρετᾷ κατάκειται πᾶσαν ὀργάν, ἀμφότερον δαπάναις τε καὶ πόνοις,
For in those days the Muse was not yet a lover of gain, nor did she work for hire. And sweet gentle-voiced odes did not go for sale, with silvered faces, from honey-voiced Terpsichore. But as things are now, she bids us heed the saying of the Argive man, which comes closest to actual truth:	μὴ φθονεραῖσι φέρειν
thus honoring the man of the fine chariot, the light of the people of Acragas. And in Crisa widely powerful Apollo looked graciously on him, and gave him glory there as well. And joined with the renowned favors of the sons of Erechtheus in splendid Athens, he found no fault with the chariot-preserving hand of the man who drove his horses,	γαστρὶ δὲ πᾶς τις ἀμύνων λιμὸν αἰανῆ τέταται·
the hand with which Nicomachus gave the horses full rein at the right moment—that driver whom the heralds of the seasons, the Elean truce-bearers of Zeus son of Cronus recognized, since they had no doubt experienced some hospitable act of friendship from him. And with sweet-breathing voice they greeted him when he fell into the lap of golden Victory	εὐαγορηθεὶς κέρδος ὕψιστον δέκεται, πολιατᾶν καὶ ξένων γλώσσας ἄωτον.
in their own land, which they call the precinct of Olympian Zeus, where the sons of Aenesidamus were linked with immortal honors. Truly, Thrasybulus, the homes of your family are not unfamiliar with lovely victory-processions, nor with the sweet boasting of songs.	ἄμμι δʼ ἔοικε Κρόνου σεισίχθονʼ υἱὸν γείτονʼ ἀμειβομένοις εὐεργέταν ἁρμάτων ἱπποδρόμιον κελαδῆσαι,
and he upheld the raising of horses according to the customs of all Greeks. He also welcomed all the banquets for the gods, and the force of the blowing wind never made him furl his sail around his hospitable table; he journeyed as far as Phasis in the summer, and in the winter sailed to the banks of the Nile .	πάντα δʼ ἐξειπεῖν, ὅσʼ ἀγώνιος Ἑρμᾶς
If any man has good fortune, either in famous contests or by the strength of his wealth, yet restrains troublesome ambition in his mind, he is worthy to be joined with his townsmen’s praises. Zeus, great excellence attends on mortals from you. Greater prosperity lives with those who revere you; but it does not keep company with crooked minds, flourishing equally for all time.	Πιερίδων ἔτι καὶ Πυθῶθεν Ὀλυμπιάδων τʼ ἐξαιρέτοις Ἀλφεοῦ ἔρνεσι φράξαι χεῖρα τιμὰν ἑπταπύλοις
As a recompense for glorious deeds, it is right to celebrate a noble man, and it is right to exalt him in victory-songs with the gentle Graces. Yes, in two contests Melissus has had a share of good fortune, to turn his heart to sweet joyfulness; he received garlands in the glens of the Isthmus, and in the valley of the deep-chested lion he had Thebes announced	Θήβαισι τεύχοντʼ. εἰ δέ τις ἔνδον νέμει πλοῦτον κρυφαῖον, ἄλλοισι δʼ ἐμπίπτων γελᾷ, ψυχὰν Ἀΐδᾳ τελέων οὐ φράζεται δόξας ἄνευθεν.
Thanks to the gods, I have countless paths opening on every side; Melissus, at the Isthmian games you revealed abundant resources for celebrating in song the excellence of your family, in which the sons of Cleonymus flourish perpetually, with a god’s favor, as they progress towards the mortal end of life. But a changeable wind sweeps down and drives all men at different times.	ἁ Μοῖσα γὰρ οὐ φιλοκερδής πω τότʼ ἦν οὐδʼ ἐργάτις· οὐδʼ ἐπέρναντο γλυκεῖαι μελιφθόγγου ποτὶ Τερψιχόρας ἀργυρωθεῖσαι πρόσωπα μαλθακόφωνοι ἀοιδαί. νῦν δʼ ἐφίητι τὸ τὠργείου φυλάξαι ῥῆμʼ ἀλαθείας ἐτᾶς ἄγχιστα βαῖνον,
These men truly are spoken of as honored in Thebes from the beginning; they have good relations with the neighboring towns, and are bereft of loud arrogance. And as for the memorials that fly through all the world, memorials of boundless fame for living and dead men, they have attained all of these in full. Through their manly deeds they reached from home to touch the farthest limit, the pillars of Heracles—	χρήματα, χρήματʼ ἀνήρ, ὃς φᾶ κτεάνων θʼ ἅμα λειφθεὶς καὶ φίλων. ἐσσὶ γὰρ ὦν σοφός, οὐκ ἄγνωτʼ ἀείδω Ἰσθμίαν ἵπποισι νίκαν, τὰν Ξενοκράτει Ποσειδάων ὀπάσαις, Δωρίων αὐτῷ στεφάνωμα κόμᾳ πέμπεν ἀναδεῖσθαι σελίνων,
do not pursue excellence any farther than that! And they became breeders of horses and were pleasing to bronze-clad Ares. But on a single day the rough storm of war robbed their blessed hearth of four men. Now, after the wintry gloom of the changing months, the ground has blossomed as if with crimson roses	εὐάρματον ἄνδρα γεραίρων, Ἀκραγαντίνων φάος. ἐν Κρίσᾳ δʼ εὐρυσθενὴς εἶδʼ Ἀπόλλων νιν πόρε τʼ ἀγλαΐαν καὶ τόθι· κλειναῖς δʼ Ἐρεχθειδᾶν χαρίτεσσιν ἀραρὼς ταῖς λιπαραῖς ἐν Ἀθάναις, οὐκ ἐμέμφθη ῥυσίδιφρον χεῖρα πλαξίπποιο φωτός,
by the will of the gods. The shaker of the earth who dwells at Onchestus and at the sea-bridge before the walls of Corinth, by offering to that family this marvellous song, wakes from her bed their ancient fame for glorious deeds. For she had fallen asleep, but now she has awakened and her body shines, marvellous to see, like the morning-star among other stars.	γαῖαν ἀνὰ σφετέραν, τὰν δὴ καλέοισιν Ὀλυμπίου Διὸς ἄλσος· ἵνʼ ἀθανάτοις Αἰνησιδάμου παῖδες ἐν τιμαῖς ἔμιχθεν. καὶ γὰρ οὐκ ἀγνῶτες ὑμῖν ἐντὶ δόμοι οὔτε κώμων, ὦ Θρασύβουλʼ, ἐρατῶν, οὔτε μελικόμπων ἀοιδᾶν.
She proclaimed their chariot victorious on the high ground of Athens and also in Sicyon at the games of Adrastus, and thus gave them leaves of song, like these, from the singers of their time. Nor did they keep their curved chariot from competing in the general contests; striving against all of Greece , they rejoiced in spending their wealth on their horses. Those who attempt nothing face silence and obscurity,	οὐ γὰρ πάγος, οὐδὲ προσάντης ἁ κέλευθος γίνεται, εἴ τις εὐδόξων ἐς ἀνδρῶν ἄγοι τιμὰς Ἑλικωνιάδων. μακρὰ δισκήσαις ἀκοντίσσαιμι τοσοῦθʼ, ὅσον ὀργὰν Ξεινοκράτης ὑπὲρ ἀνθρώπων γλυκεῖαν ἔσχεν. αἰδοῖος μὲν ἦν ἀστοῖς ὁμιλεῖν,
and fortune remains hidden even to those who contend, until they reach the final goal. For she dispenses from this side and from that, and the skill of weaker men can overtake and trip up a stronger man. Indeed, you know of the bloodstained might of Aias, which late at night he pierced by falling on his own sword, thus bringing blame on all the sons of the Greeks who went to Troy .	μή νυν, ὅτι φθονεραὶ θνατῶν φρένας ἀμφικρέμανται ἐλπίδες, μήτʼ ἀρετάν ποτε σιγάτω πατρῴαν, μηδὲ τούσδʼ ὕμνους· ἐπεί τοι οὐκ ἐλινύσοντας αὐτοὺς εἰργασάμαν. ταῦτα, Νικάσιππʼ, ἀπόνειμον, ὅταν ξεῖνον ἐμὸν ἠθαῖον ἔλθῃς.
But he is honored throughout the world by Homer, who set the record right concerning all his excellence and told it with the staff of his divine words, for posterity to play. For if one says something well, that saying goes forth speaking with an immortal voice. And the radiance of fine deeds, forever unquenchable, has crossed the fruitful earth and the sea.	εἴ τις ἀνδρῶν εὐτυχήσαις ἢ σὺν εὐδόξοις ἀέθλοις ἢ σθένει πλούτου κατέχει φρασὶν αἰανῆ κόρον, ἄξιος εὐλογίαις ἀστῶν μεμίχθαι. Ζεῦ, μεγάλαι δʼ ἀρεταὶ θνατοῖς ἕπονται ἐκ σέθεν· ζώει δὲ μάσσων ὄλβος ὀπιζομένων, πλαγίαις δὲ φρένεσσιν οὐχ ὁμῶς πάντα χρόνον θάλλων ὁμιλεῖ.
May we win the favor of the Muses and kindle that torch of song, a worthy garland from the pancratium for Melissus, too, the scion of the race of Telesias. For in the toil of conflict he resembles the spirit of loud-roaring lions in boldness, while in wisdom he is like the fox, who forestalls the swoop of the eagle by falling on her back. And it is right to do anything to blot out one’s enemy.	εὐκλέων δʼ ἔργων ἄποινα χρὴ μὲν ὑμνῆσαι τὸν ἐσλόν, χρὴ δὲ κωμάζοντʼ ἀγαναῖς χαρίτεσσιν βαστάσαι. ἔστι δὲ καὶ διδύμων ἀέ θλων Μελίσσῳ μοῖρα πρὸς εὐφροσύναν τρέψαι γλυκεῖαν ἦτορ, ἐν βάσσαισιν Ἰσθμοῦ δεξαμένῳ στεφάνους, τὰ δὲ κοίλᾳ λέοντος ἐν βαθυστέρνου νάπᾳ κάρυξε Θήβαν
Alcmena’s son. He went to Olympus , after he had explored all lands and the high-cliffed hollow of the gray sea, and had tamed the straits for sailors. Now he dwells beside aegis-bearing Zeus, and has the most beautiful prosperity. He is honored as a friend by the immortals and is married to Hebe; he is lord of a golden house, and son-in-law to Hera.	ἔστι μοι θεῶν ἕκατι μυρία παντᾷ κέλευθος· ὦ Μέλισσʼ, εὐμαχανίαν γὰρ ἔφανας Ἰσθμίοις ὑμετέρας ἀρετὰς ὕμνῳ διώκειν· αἷσι Κλεωνυμίδαι θάλλοντες αἰεὶ σὺν θεῷ θνατὸν διέρχονται βιότου τέλος. ἄλλοτε δʼ ἀλλοῖος οὖρος πάντας ἀνθρώπους ἐπαΐσσων ἐλαύνει.
For him, above the Electran gates, we Thebans, busily preparing the feast and the circle of newly-built altars, pile up burnt offerings in honor of the eight bronze-clad men, now dead, the sons whom Megara , Creon’s daughter, bore him. For them the flame rises in the rays of the setting sun and blazes all night long, prodding the air with fragrant smoke.	καὶ μηκέτι μακροτέραν σπεύδειν ἀρετάν. ἱπποτρόφοι τʼ ἐγένοντο, χαλκέῳ τʼ Ἄρει ἅδον. ἀλλʼ ἁμέρᾳ γὰρ ἐν μιᾷ τραχεῖα νιφὰς πολέμοιο τεσσάρων ἀνδρῶν ἐρήμωσεν μάκαιραν ἑστίαν· νῦν δʼ αὖ μετὰ χειμέριον ποικίλων μηνῶν ζόφον χθὼν ὥτε φοινικέοισιν ἄνθησεν ῥόδοις
And on the second day is that struggle of strength, the final event of the annual games. And there, his head wreathed with white	ἅ τε κἀν γουνοῖς Ἀθανᾶν ἅρμα καρύξαισα νικᾶν ἔν τʼ Ἀδραστείοις ἀέθλοις Σικυῶνος ὤπασεν τοιάδε τῶν τότʼ ἐόντων φύλλʼ ἀοιδᾶν. οὐδὲ παναγυρίων ξυνᾶν ἀπεῖχον καμπύλον δίφρον, Πανελλάνεσσι δʼ ἐριζόμενοι δαπάνᾳ χαῖρον ἵππων. τῶν ἀπειράτων γὰρ ἄγνωστοι σιωπαί,
myrtle, this man showed forth a double victory, having won before in the boy’s contest by heeding the wise advice of his helmsman and trainer, Orseas. I will honor him together with Orseas in my victory-song, pouring delightful grace on both.	ἔστιν δʼ ἀφάνεια τύχας καὶ μαρναμένων, πρὶν τέλος ἄκρον ἱκέσθαι· τῶν τε γὰρ καὶ τῶν διδοῖ· καὶ κρέσσονʼ ἀνδρῶν χειρόνων ἔσφαλε τέχνα καταμάρψαισʼ. ἴστε μὰν Αἴαντος ἀλκὰν φοίνιον, τὰν ὀψίᾳ ἐν νυκτὶ ταμὼν περὶ ᾧ φασγάνῳ, μομφὰν ἔχει παίδεσσιν Ἑλλάνων ὅσοι Τρῴανδʼ ἔβαν.
Mother of the Sun, Theia of many names, for your sake men honor gold as more powerful than anything else; and through the value you bestow on them, o queen, ships contending on the sea and yoked teams of horses in swift-whirling contests become marvels.	προφρόνων Μοισᾶν τύχοιμεν, κεῖνον ἅψαι πυρσὸν ὕμνων καὶ Μελίσσῳ, παγκρατίου στεφάνωμʼ ἐπάξιον, ἔρνεϊ Τελεσιάδα. τόλμᾳ γὰρ εἰκὼς θυμὸν ἐριβρεμετᾶν θηρῶν λεόντων ἐν πόνῳ, μῆτιν δʼ ἀλώπηξ, αἰετοῦ ἅ τʼ ἀναπιτναμένα ῥόμβον ἴσχει. χρὴ δὲ πᾶν ἔρδοντα μαυρῶσαι τὸν ἐχθρόν.
And in athletic contests, someone who has wreathed his hair with many garlands has achieved longed-for fame, when he has been victorious with his hands or with the swiftness of his feet. But the valor of men is judged by gods, and there are only two things that cultivate the sweetest flower of life in blossoming prosperity:	οὐ γὰρ φύσιν Ὠαριωνείαν ἔλαχεν· ἀλλʼ ὀνοτὸς μὲν ἰδέσθαι, συμπεσεῖν δʼ ἀκμᾷ βαρύς. καίτοι πότʼ Ἀνταίου δόμους Θηβᾶν ἀπὸ Καδμεϊᾶν μορφὰν βραχύς, ψυχὰν δʼ ἄκαμπτος, προσπαλαίσων ἦλθʼ ἀνὴρ τὰν πυροφόρον Λιβύαν, κρανίοις ὄφρα ξένων ναὸν Ποσειδάωνος ἐρέφοντα σχέθοι,
to have good fortune and a noble reputation. Do not seek to become Zeus; you have everything, if a share of these fine things comes to you. Mortal aims befit mortal men. But for you, Phylacidas, flourishing twofold excellence is recorded at the Isthmus, and at Nemea for both you and Pytheas in the pancratium. But my heart cannot taste songs without telling of the race of Aeacus. I have come with the Graces for the sons of Lampon	υἱὸς Ἀλκμήνας· ὃς Οὐλυμπόνδʼ ἔβα, γαίας τε πάσας καὶ βαθύκρημνον πολιᾶς ἁλὸς ἐξευρὼν θέναρ, ναυτιλίαισί τε πορθμὸν ἁμερώσαις. νῦν δὲ παρʼ Αἰγιόχῳ κάλλιστον ὄλβον ἀμφέπων ναίει, τετίματαί τε πρὸς ἀθανάτων φίλος, Ἥβαν τʼ ὀπυίει, χρυσέων οἴκων ἄναξ καὶ γαμβρὸς Ἥρας.
to this well-governed city. If Aegina turns her steps to the clear road of god-given deeds, then do not grudge to mix for her in song a boast that is fitting recompense for toils. In heroic times, too, fine warriors gained fame, and they are celebrated with lyres and flutes in full-voiced harmonies	τῷ μὲν Ἀλεκτρᾶν ὕπερθεν δαῖτα πορσύνοντες ἀστοὶ καὶ νεόδματα στεφανώματα βωμῶν αὔξομεν ἔμπυρα χαλκοαρᾶν ὀκτὼ θανόντων, τοὺς Μεγάρα τέκε οἱ Κρειοντὶς υἱούς· τοῖσιν ἐν δυθμαῖσιν αὐγᾶν φλὸξ ἀνατελλομένα συνεχὲς παννυχίζει αἰθέρα κνις άε ντι λακτίζοισα καπνῷ,
for time beyond reckoning. Heroes who are honored by the grace of Zeus provide a theme for skilled poets: among the Aetolians the brave sons of Oeneus are worshipped with shining sacrifices; in Thebes the horseman Iolaus has his honor, and Perseus in Argos , and the spearman Castor together with Polydeuces by the streams of Eurotas.	ἔνθα λευκωθεὶς κάρα
Men whose voices name the outstanding island of Aegina as their fatherland, built long ago as a tower for lofty excellence to ascend. My swift tongue has many arrows, to shout the praises of these heroes. And now the city of Aias, Salamis, could testify that she was saved by her sailors in Ares’ confrontation	μᾶτερ Ἁλίου πολυώνυμε Θεία, σέο ἕκατι καὶ μεγασθενῆ νόμισαν χρυσὸν ἄνθρωποι περιώσιον ἄλλων· καὶ γὰρ ἐριζόμεναι νᾶες ἐν πόντῳ καὶ ὑφʼ ἅρμασιν ἵπποι διὰ τεάν, ὤνασσα, τιμὰν ὠκυδινάτοις ἐν ἁμίλλαισι θαυμασταὶ πέλονται·
in the destructive storm sent by Zeus, when slaughter poured like hail on countless men. Nevertheless, quench this boast in silence. Zeus dispenses both good and bad, Zeus the master of all. But such honors as these also welcome the joy of triumph, covered with the delicious honey of song. Let a man strive and contend	ἔν τʼ ἀγωνίοις ἀέθλοισι ποθεινὸν κλέος ἔπραξεν, ὅντινʼ ἀθρόοι στέφανοι χερσὶ νικάσαντʼ ἀνέδησαν ἔθειραν ἢ ταχυτᾶτι ποδῶν. κρίνεται δʼ ἀλκὰ διὰ δαίμονας ἀνδρῶν. δύο δέ τοι ζωᾶς ἄωτον μοῦνα ποιμαίνοντι τὸν ἄλπνιστον εὐανθεῖ σὺν ὄλβῳ,
in the games when he has learned from the race of Cleonicus. The long toil of their men is not hidden in blind darkness, nor has thought of the expense fretted away their devotion to their hopes. I praise Pytheas also among limb-subduing pancratiasts, skillful with his hands in guiding straight the course of Phylacidas’ blows, and with a mind to match. Take a garland for him, and bring him a fillet of fine wool, and send along this winged new song.	εἴ τις εὖ πάσχων λόγον ἐσλὸν ἀκούῃ. μὴ μάτευε Ζεὺς γενέσθαι· πάντʼ ἔχεις, εἴ σε τούτων μοῖρʼ ἐφίκοιτο καλῶν. θνατὰ θνατοῖσι πρέπει. τὶν δʼ ἐν Ἰσθμῷ διπλόα θάλλοισʼ ἀρετά, Φυλακίδα, κεῖται, Νεμέα δὲ καὶ ἀμφοῖν, Πυθέᾳ τε παγκρατίου. τὸ δʼ ἐμὸν οὐκ ἄτερ Αἰακιδᾶν κέαρ ὕμνων γεύεται· σὺν Χάρισιν δʼ ἔμολον Λάμπωνος υἱοῖς
Just as we mix the second bowl of wine when the men’s symposium is flourishing, here is the second song of the Muses for Lampon’s children and their athletic victories: first in Nemea, Zeus, in your honor they received the choicest of garlands, and now in honor of the lord of the Isthmus and the fifty Nereids, for the victory of the youngest son, Phylacidas. May there be a third libation of honey-voiced songs to pour over Aegina in honor of Zeus Soter of Olympia.	μυρίον χρόνον· μελέταν δὲ σοφισταῖς Διὸς ἕκατι πρόσβαλον σεβιζόμενοι· ἐν μὲν Αἰτωλῶν θυσίαισι φαενναῖς Οἰνεΐδαι κρατεροί, ἐν δὲ Θήβαις ἱπποσόας Ἰόλαος γέρας ἔχει, Περσεὺς δʼ ἐν Ἄργει, Κάστορος δʼ αἰχμὰ Πολυδεύκ εο ς τʼ ἐπʼ Εὐρώτα ῥεέθροις.
For if a man, rejoicing in expense and toil, achieves godly excellence, and a divinity sows the seed of lovely fame in him, then he already casts his anchor on the farthest shore of prosperity, since he is honored by the gods. The son of Cleonicus prays that with such feelings he will meet death and welcome gray old age. And I entreat Clotho, throned on high, and her sister Fates, to hear my friend’s prayers for fame.	ἀλλʼ ἐν Οἰνώνᾳ μεγαλήτορες ὀργαὶ Αἰακοῦ παίδων τε· τοὶ καὶ σὺν μάχαις δὶς πόλιν Τρώων πράθον ἑσπόμενοι Ἡρακλῆϊ πρότερον, καὶ σὺν Ἀτρείδαις. ἔλα νῦν μοι πεδόθεν· λέγε, τίνες Κύκνον, τίνες Ἕκτορα πέφνον, καὶ στράταρχον Αἰθιόπων ἄφοβον Μέμνονα χαλκοάραν· τίς ἄρʼ ἐσλὸν Τήλεφον τρῶσεν ἑῷ δορὶ Καΐκου παρʼ ὄχθαις;
And as for you, sons of Aeacus with your golden chariots, I say that it is my clearest law to sprinkle you with praises whenever I set foot on this island. Countless continuous roads have been cut a hundred feet wide for your fine deeds, both beyond the springs of the Nile and through the land of the Hyperboreans. There is no city so barbarous or so strange in its speech that it does not know the fame of the hero Peleus, the fortunate in-law of gods,	τοῖσιν Αἴγιναν προφέρει στόμα πάτραν διαπρεπέα νᾶσον· τετείχισται δὲ πάλαι πύργος ὑψηλαῖς ἀρεταῖς ἀναβαίνειν. πολλὰ μὲν ἀρτιεπὴς γλῶσσά μοι τοξεύματʼ ἔχει περὶ κείνων κελαδέσαι· καὶ νῦν ἐν Ἄρει μαρτυρήσαι κεν πόλις Αἴαντος ὀρθωθεῖσα ναύταις
or of Aias and his father Telamon. The son of Alcmena led him in ships to Troy, the toil of heroes, for war that delights in bronze, as an eager ally along with the men of Tiryns because of Laomedon’s wrongdoing. He took Pergamos, and with Telamon’s help he slew the tribes of Meropes, and the herdsman Alcyoneus, huge as a mountain, whom he found at Phlegrae, and he did not keep his hands off the deep-voiced bow-string, not	ἀμφʼ ἀέθλοισιν γενεὰν Κλεονίκου ἐκμαθών· οὔτοι τετύφλωται μακρὸς μόχθος ἀνδρῶν· οὐδʼ ὁπόσαι δαπάναι ἐλπίδων ἔκνισʼ ὄπιν. αἰνέω καὶ Πυθέαν ἐν γυιοδάμαις Φυλακίδᾳ πλαγᾶν δρόμον εὐθυπορῆσαι χερσὶ δεξιόν, νόῳ ἀντίπαλον. λάμβανέ οἱ στέφανον, φέρε δʼ εὔμαλλον μίτραν, καὶ πτερόεντα νέον σύμπεμψον ὕμνον.
now, now with divine prayers I entreat you to grant this man a brave son from Eriboea, a son fated to be my guest-friend. May he have a body as invulnerable as this skin that is now wrapped around me, from the beast whom I killed that day in Nemea as the very first of my labors. And may he have spirit to match.” When he had spoken, the god sent to him the king of birds, a great eagle. He felt thrilled inside with sweet joy,	εἰ γάρ τις ἀνθρώπων δαπάνᾳ τε χαρεὶς καὶ πόνῳ πράσσει θεοδμάτους ἀρετάς, σύν τέ οἱ δαίμων φυτεύει δόξαν ἐπήρατον, ἐσχατιαῖς ἤδη πρὸς ὄλβου βάλλετʼ ἄγκυραν θεότιμος ἐών. τοίαισιν ὀργαῖς εὔχεται ἀντιάσαις Ἀΐδαν γῆράς τε δέξασθαι πολιὸν ὁ Κλεονίκου παῖς· ἐγὼ δʼ ὑψίθρονον Κλωθὼ κασιγνήτας τε προσεννέπω ἑσπέσθαι κλυταῖς ἀνδρὸς φίλου Μοίρας ἐφετμαῖς.
and he spoke like a prophet: “Telamon, you will have the son that you ask for. Name him after the bird that appeared: wide-ruling Aias, awesome in the war-toils of the people.” He spoke, and immediately sat down. But for me it would take a long time to tell the story of all their excellence. For I came, Muse, a steward of victory-songs to Phylacidas and Pytheas and Euthymenes. The story will be told in the Argive manner, very briefly.	οὐδʼ ἅτις Αἴαντος Τελαμωνιάδα καὶ πατρός· τὸν χαλκοχάρμαν ἐς πόλεμον ἆγε σὺν Τιρυνθίοισι πρόφρονα σύμμαχον ἐς Τρωΐαν, ἥρωσι μόχθον, Λαομεδοντίαν ὑπὲρ ἀμπλακίαν ἐν ναυσὶν Ἀλκμήνας τέκος. εἷλε δὲ Περγαμίαν, πέφνεν δὲ σὺν κείνῳ Μερόπων ἔθνεα καὶ τὸν βουβόταν οὔρεϊ ἴσον Φλέγραισιν εὑρὼν Ἀλκυονῆ, σφετέρας δʼ οὐ φείσατο χερσὶν βαρυφθόγγοιο νευρᾶς
For those splendid boys and their uncle won three victories in the pancratium—at the Isthmus, and others at Nemea with its fine trees, and they brought to light a great share of praises. With the lovely dew of the Graces they refresh the family of the Psalychids; they have kept upright the house of Themistius, and they live in a city which the gods love. Lampon, “taking care with his work,” honors these words of Hesiod, and he advises his sons with them too,	Ἡρακλέης. ἀλλʼ Αἰακίδαν καλέων ἐς πλόον κεῖνον κύρησε δαινυμένων. τὸν μὲν ἐν ῥινῷ λέοντος στάντα κελήσατο νεκταρέαις σπονδαῖσιν ἄρξαι καρτεραίχμαν Ἀμφιτρυωνιάδαν, ἄνδωκε δʼ αὐτῷ φέρτατος οἰνοδόκον φιάλαν χρυσῷ πεφρικυῖαν Τελαμών, ὁ δʼ ἀνατείναις οὐρανῷ χεῖρας ἀμάχους αὔδασε τοιοῦτον ἔπος· εἴ ποτʼ ἐμάν, ὦ Ζεῦ πάτερ, θυμῷ ἐθέλων ἀρὰν ἄκουσας,
thus bringing a shared adornment to his city. He is loved for his kindness to his guest-friends; he pursues with moderation in his thoughts and restrains with moderation. He does not say one thing and think another. You might say that for athletes he is like the bronze-mastering Naxian whetstone among other stones. I shall give him to drink the pure water of Dirce, which the deep-waisted daughters of	εἶπέν τε φωνήσαις ἅτε μάντις ἀνήρ· ἔσσεταί τοι παῖς, ὃν αἰτεῖς, ὦ Τελαμών· καί νιν ὄρνιχος φανέντος κέκλεʼ ἐπώνυμον εὐρυβίαν Αἴαντα, λαῶν ἐν πόνοις ἔκπαγλον Ἐνυαλίου. ὣς ἆρα εἰπὼν αὐτίκα ἕζετʼ. ἐμοὶ δὲ μακρὸν πάσας ἀν αγήσασθʼ ἀρετάς· Φυλακίδᾳ γὰρ ἦλθον, ὦ Μοῖσα, ταμίας Πυθέᾳ τε κώμων Εὐθυμένει τε. τὸν Ἀργείων τρόπον εἰρήσεταί που κἀν βραχίστοις.
golden-robed Mnemosyne brought forth beside the fine-walled gates of Cadmus.	ἄραντο γὰρ νίκας ἀπὸ παγκρατίου τρεῖς ἀπʼ Ἰσθμοῦ, τὰς δʼ ἀπʼ εὐφύλλου Νεμέας, ἀγλαοὶ παῖδές τε καὶ μάτρως· ἀνὰ δʼ ἄγαγον ἐς φάος οἵαν μοῖραν ὕμνων· τὰν Ψαλυχιδᾶν δὲ πάτραν Χαρίτων ἄρδοντι καλλίστᾳ δρόσῳ, τόν τε Θεμιστίου ὀρθώσαντες οἶκον τάνδε πόλιν θεοφιλῆ ναίοισι. Λάμπων δὲ μελέταν ἔργοις ὀπάζων Ἡσιόδου μάλα τιμᾷ τοῦτʼ ἔπος, υἱοῖσί τε φράζων παραινεῖ,
In which of the local glories of the past, divinely blessed Thebe, did you most delight your spirit? Was it when you raised to eminence the one seated beside Demeter of the clashing bronze cymbals, flowing-haired Dionysus? Or when you received, as a snow-shower of gold in the middle of the night, the greatest of the gods,	χρυσοπέπλου Μναμοσύνας ἀνέτειλαν παρʼ εὐτειχέσιν Κάδμου πύλαις.
of countless companions, to Argos, home of horses? Or because you stood upright on its feet the Dorian colony of the men of Lacedaemon, and your descendants, the Aegeids, captured Amyclae according to the Pythian oracles? But since ancient grace sleeps, and mortals are forgetful	τίνι τῶν πάρος, ὦ μάκαιρα Θήβα, καλῶν ἐπιχωρίων μάλιστα θυμὸν τεὸν εὔφρανας; ἦ ῥα χαλκοκρότου πάρεδρον Δαμάτερος ἁνίκʼ εὐρυχαίταν ἄντειλας Διόνυσον; ἢ χρυσῷ μεσονύκτιον νίφοντα δεξαμένα τὸν φέρτατον θεῶν,
of whatever does not reach the highest bloom of skillful song, joined to glorious streams of words, then begin the victory procession with a sweet-singing hymn for Strepsiades; for he is the victor in the pancratium at the Isthmus, both awesome in his strength and handsome to look at; and he treats excellence as no worse a possession than beauty.	ὁπότʼ Ἀμφιτρύωνος ἐν θυρέτροις σταθεὶς ἄλοχον μετῆλθεν Ἡρακλείοις γοναῖς; ἢ ὅτʼ ἀμφὶ πυκναῖς Τειρεσίαο βουλαῖς; ἢ ὅτʼ ἀμφʼ Ἰόλαον ἱππόμητιν; ἢ Σπαρτῶν ἀκαμαντολογχᾶν; ἢ ὅτε καρτερᾶς Ἄδραστον ἐξ ἀλαλᾶς ἄμπεμψας ὀρφανὸν
He is made radiant by the violet-haired Muses, and he has given a share in his flowering garland to his uncle and namesake, for whom Ares of the bronze shield mixed the cup of destiny; but honor is laid up as recompense for good men. For let him know clearly, whoever, in this cloud of war, wards off the hailstorm of blood in defense of his dear fatherland	ὅ τι μὴ σοφίας ἄωτον ἄκρον κλυταῖς ἐπέων ῥοαῖσιν ἐξίκηται ζυγέν. κώμαζʼ ἔπειτεν ἁδυμελεῖ σὺν ὕμνῳ καὶ Στρεψιάδᾳ· φέρει γὰρ Ἰσθμοῖ νίκαν παγκρατίου· σθένει τʼ ἔκπαγλος ἰδεῖν τε μορφάεις· ἄγει τʼ ἀρετὰν οὐκ αἴσχιον φυᾶς.
by bringing destruction to the enemy host, that he is causing the greatest glory to grow for the race of his fellow-citizens, in both his life and his death. And you, son of Diodotus, emulating the warrior Meleager, emulating Hector and Amphiaraus, breathed out your blossoming youth	φλέγεται δὲ ἰοπλόκοισι Μοίσαις, μάτρωΐ θʼ ὁμωνύμῳ δέδωκε κοινὸν θάλος, χάλκασπις ᾧ πότμον μὲν Ἄρης ἔμιξεν, τιμὰ δʼ ἀγαθοῖσιν ἀντίκειται. ἴστω γὰρ σαφὲς ὅστις ἐν ταύτᾳ νεφέλᾳ χάλαζαν αἵματος πρὸ φίλας πάτρας ἀμύνεται,
in the front ranks, where the best men sustained the strife of war at the limit of their hopes. They endured unspeakable sorrow; but now the holder of the earth has sent me calm after the storm. I shall sing entwining my hair with garlands. May the envy of the immortals not disturb	λοιγὸν ἄντα φέρων ἐναντίῳ στρατῷ, ἀστῶν γενεᾷ μέγιστον κλέος αὔξων ζώων τʼ ἀπὸ καὶ θανών. τὺ δέ, Διοδότοιο παῖ, μαχατὰν αἰνέων Μελέαγρον, αἰνέων δὲ καὶ Ἕκτορα Ἀμφιάρηόν τε, εὐανθέʼ ἀπέπνευσας ἁλικίαν
whatever delight I pursue from day to day as I peacefully make my way towards old age and the allotted span of my life. For we die all alike, but our fates are diverse. If a man looks to things far away, he is too short to reach the bronze-floored home of the gods; winged Pegasus threw	προμάχων ἀνʼ ὅμιλον, ἔνθʼ ἄριστοι ἔσχον πολέμοιο νεῖκος ἐσχάταις ἐλπίσιν. ἔτλαν δὲ πένθος οὐ φατόν· ἀλλὰ νῦν μοι Γαιάοχος εὐδίαν ὄπασσεν ἐκ χειμῶνος. ἀείσομαι χαίταν στεφάνοισιν ἁρμόσαις. ὁ δʼ ἀθανάτων μὴ θρασσέτω φθόνος,
his master Bellerophon, who wanted to go to the dwelling-places of heaven and the company of Zeus. A thing that is sweet beyond measure is awaited by a most bitter end. But grant to us, Loxias, luxuriant with your golden hair, a blossoming garland also from your contests at Pytho.	ὅ τι τερπνὸν ἐφάμερον διώκων ἕκαλος ἔπειμι γῆρας ἔς τε τὸν μόρσιμον αἰῶνα. θνᾴσκομεν γὰρ ὁμῶς ἅπαντες· δαίμων δʼ ἄϊσος· τὰ μακρὰ δʼ εἴ τις παπταίνει, βραχὺς ἐξικέσθαι χαλκόπεδον θεῶν ἕδραν· ὅτι πτερόεις ἔρριψε Πάγασος
an unbearable hardship for Greece. But as for me, the passing away of terror has stopped my mighty worry. It is always better to look at what lies before one’s foot, in every case. For a treacherous lifetime hangs over men’s heads, twisting around the path of life. Yet even this may be healed for mortals, if only they have freedom. It is right for a man to take to heart good hope; and it is right for a man raised in seven-gated Thebes to offer the choicest bloom of the Graces to Aegina. For as twin daughters they were born to the same father, the youngest of Asopus’ children, and they were pleasing to Zeus the king. He caused one of them to dwell beside the beautiful stream of Dirce, to lead a chariot-loving city;	Κλεάνδρῳ τις ἁλικίᾳ τε λύτρον εὔδοξον, ὦ νέοι, καμάτων πατρὸς ἀγλαὸν Τελεσάρχου παρὰ πρόθυρον ἰὼν ἀνεγειρέτω κῶμον, Ἰσθμιάδος τε νίκας ἄποινα, καὶ Νεμέᾳ ἀέθλων ὅτι κράτος ἐξεῦρε. τῷ καὶ ἐγώ, καίπερ ἀχνύμενος θυμόν, αἰτέομαι χρυσέαν καλέσαι Μοῖσαν. ἐκ μεγάλων δὲ πενθ έω ν λυθέντες μήτʼ ἐν ὀρφανίᾳ πέσωμεν στεφάνων, μήτε κάδεα θεράπευε· παυσάμενοι δʼ ἀπρήκτων κακῶν γλυκύ τι δαμωσόμεθα καὶ μετὰ πόνον· ἐπειδὴ τὸν ὑπὲρ κεφαλᾶς τὸν Ταντάλου λίθον παρά τις ἔτρεψεν ἄμμι θεός,
but he carried you to the island Oenopia and slept with you there, where you bore Aeacus, the dearest of all men on earth to the loud-thundering father. Aeacus settled disputes even for the gods. His god-like sons and their sons, devoted to war, were the best in manliness, engaged in the brazen battle-throng that causes groans, and they were wise and prudent in spirit. All this was remembered even by the assembly of the blessed gods, when Zeus and splendid Poseidon contended for marriage with Thetis, each of them wanting her to be his lovely bride; for desire possessed them. But the immortal minds of the gods did not accomplish that marriage for them,	σὲ δʼ ἐς νᾶσον Οἰνοπίαν ἐνεγκὼν κοιμᾶτο, δῖον ἔνθα τέκες Αἰακὸν βαρυσφαράγῳ πατρὶ κεδνότατον ἐπιχθονίων· ὃ καὶ δαιμόνεσσι δίκας ἐπείραινε· τοῦ μὲν ἀντίθεοι ἀρίστευον υἱέες υἱέων τʼ ἀρηΐφιλοι παῖδες ἀνορέᾳ χάλκεον στονόεντʼ ἀμφέπειν ὅμαδον· σώφρονές τʼ ἐγένοντο πινυτοί τε θυμόν. ταῦτα καὶ μακάρων ἐμέμναντʼ ἀγοραί, Ζεὺς ὅτʼ ἀμφὶ Θέτιος ἀγλαός τʼ ἔρισαν Ποσειδᾶν γάμῳ, ἄλοχον εὐειδέʼ ἐθέλων ἑκάτερος ἑὰν ἔμμεν· ἔρως γὰρ ἔχεν. ἀλλʼ οὔ σφιν ἄμβροτοι τέλεσαν εὐνὰν θεῶν πραπίδες,
when they heard the divine prophecies. Wise Themis spoke in their midst and said that it was fated that the sea-goddess should bear a princely son, stronger than his father, who would wield another weapon in his hand more powerful than the thunderbolt or the irresistible trident, if she lay with Zeus or one of his brothers. “No, cease from this. Let her accept a mortal’s bed, and see her son die in battle, a son who is like Ares in the strength of his hands and like lightning in the swift prime of his feet. My counsel is to bestow this god-granted honor of marriage on Peleus son of Aeacus, who is said to be the most pious man living on the plain of Iolcus.	ἐπεὶ θεσφάτων ἐπάκουσαν· εἶπε δʼ εὔβουλος ἐν μέσοισι Θέμις, οὕνεκεν πεπρωμένον ἦν φέρτερον γόνον ἄνακτα πατρὸς τεκεῖν ποντίαν θεόν, ὃς κεραυνοῦ τε κρέσσον ἄλλο βέλος διώξει χερὶ τριόδοντός τʼ ἀμαιμακέτου, Δί τε μισγομέναν ἢ Διὸς παρʼ ἀδελφεοῖσιν.— ἀλλὰ τὰ μὲν παύσατε· βροτέων δὲ λεχέων τυχοῖσα υἱὸν εἰσιδέτω θανόντʼ ἐν πολέμῳ, χεῖρας Ἄρεΐ τʼ ἐναλίγκιον στεροπαῖσί τʼ ἀκμὰν ποδῶν. τὸ μὲν ἐμὸν Πηλέϊ γάμου θεόμορον ὀπάσσαι γέρας Αἰακίδᾳ, ὅντʼ εὐσεβέστατον φάτις Ἰωλκοῦ τράφειν πεδίον·
Let the message be sent at once to Cheiron’s immortal cave, right away, and let the daughter of Nereus never again place the leaves of strife in our hands. On the evening of the full moon let her loosen the lovely bridle of her virginity for that hero.” So the goddess spoke, addressing the sons of Cronus, and they nodded assent with their immortal brows. The fruit of her words did not perish, for they say that Zeus shared the common concern even for the marriage of Thetis. And the voices of poets made known the youthful excellence of Achilles to those who had been unaware of it—Achilles, who stained the vine-covered plain of Mysia, spattering it with the dark blood of Telephus,	ἰόντων δʼ ἐς ἄφθιτον ἄντρον εὐθὺς Χείρωνος αὐτίκʼ ἀγγελίαι· μηδὲ Νηρέος θυγάτηρ νεικέων πέταλα δὶς ἐγγυαλιζέτω ἄμμιν· ἐν διχομηνίδεσσιν δὲ ἑσπέραις ἐρατὸν λύοι κεν χαλινὸν ὑφʼ ἥρωϊ παρθενίας. ὣς φάτο Κρονίδαις ἐννέποισα θεά· τοὶ δʼ ἐπὶ γλεφάροις νεῦσαν ἀθανάτοισιν· ἐπέων δὲ καρπὸς οὐ κατέφθινε. φαντὶ γὰρ ξύνʼ ἀλέγειν καὶ γάμον Θέτιος ἄνακτα. καὶ νεαρὰν ἔδειξαν σοφῶν στόματʼ ἀπείροισιν ἀρετὰν Ἀχιλέος· ὃ καὶ Μύσιον ἀμπελόεν αἵμαξε Τηλέφου μέλανι ῥαίνων φόνῳ πεδίον,
and bridged a homecoming for the Atreids, and freed Helen, cutting with his spear the sinews of Troy, which had once tried to keep him from marshalling on the plain the work of man-slaying war—he cut down the high-spirited strength of Memnon, and Hector, and other excellent heroes. Achilles, champion of the sons of Aeacus, showed them the way to the house of Persephone, and thus brought fame to Aegina and to his race. Even when he was dead songs did not forsake him; beside his pyre and tomb the Muses of Helicon stood, and poured over him the many-voiced dirge. It proved to be the will of the immortals to make a noble man, even when dead, a theme for the hymns of goddesses;	γεφύρωσέ τʼ Ἀτρεΐδαισι νόστον, Ἑλέναν τʼ ἐλύσατο, Τρωΐας ἶνας ἐκταμὼν δορί, ταί νιν ῥύοντό ποτε μάχας ἐναριμβρότου ἔργον ἐν πεδίῳ κορύσσοντα, Μέμνονός τε βίαν ὑπέρθυμον Ἕκτορά τʼ ἄλλους τʼ ἀριστέας· οἷς δῶμα Φερσεφόνας μανύων Ἀχιλεύς, οὖρος Αἰακιδᾶν, Αἴγιναν σφετέραν τε ῥίζαν πρόφαινεν. τὸν μὲν οὐδὲ θανόντʼ ἀοιδαὶ ἔλιπον, ἀλλά οἱ παρά τε πυρὰν τάφον θʼ Ἑλικώνιαι παρθένοι στάν, ἐπὶ θρῆνόν τε πολύφαμον ἔχεαν. ἔδοξʼ ἆρα τόδʼ ἀθανάτοις, ἐσλόν γε φῶτα καὶ φθίμενον ὕμνοις θεᾶν διδόμεν.
and even now this brings up a subject for words, and the Muses’ chariot rushes forward to shout praises in memory of Nicocles the boxer. Honor him, who won the garland of wild Dorian celery in the Isthmian valley; since he too was once victorious over all that lived around him, battering them with his inescapable hands. He is not dishonored by the offspring of his father’s distinguished brother. Therefore let another young man weave for Cleandros a garland of tender myrtle in honor of the pancratium, since the contest of Alcathous and the young men of Epidaurus welcomed him before in his success. A good man may praise him, for he did not restrain his youth, keeping it hidden in his pocket and ignorant of fine deeds.	τὸ καὶ νῦν φέρει λόγον, ἔσσυταί τε Μοισαῖον ἅρμα Νικοκλέος μνᾶμα πυγμάχου κελαδῆσαι. γεραίρετέ νιν, ὃς Ἴσθμιον ἂν νάπος Δωρίων ἔλαχεν σελίνων· ἐπεὶ περικτίονας ἐνίκασε δή ποτε καὶ κεῖνος ἄνδρας ἀφύκτῳ χερὶ κλονέων. τὸν μὲν οὐ κατελέγχει κριτοῦ γενεὰ πατραδελφεοῦ· ἁλίκων τῷ τις ἁβρὸν ἀμφὶ παγκρατίου Κλεάνδρῳ πλεκέτω μυρσίνας στέφανον, ἐπεί νιν Ἀλκαθόου τʼ ἀγὼν σὺν τύχᾳ ἐν Ἐπιδαύρῳ τε νεότας δέκετο πρίν· τὸν αἰνεῖν ἀγαθῷ παρέχει· ἥβαν γὰρ οὐκ ἄπειρον ὑπὸ χειᾷ καλῶν δάμασεν.
